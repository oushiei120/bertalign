红楼梦原文,English Translation
第一回,Chapter 1
甄士隐 梦幻 识通 灵,Zhen Shi-yin makes the Stone 's acquaintance in a dream
贾雨村 风尘 怀 闺秀,And Jia Yu-cun finds that poverty is not incompatible with romantic feelings
看官 ： 你 道 此书 从 何 而 起 ？,"GENTLE READER , What , you may ask , was the origin of this book ?"
— — 说来 虽 近 荒唐 ， 细玩 颇 有 趣味 。,"Though the answer to this question may at first seem to border on the absurd , reflection will show that there is a good deal more in it than meets the eye ."
却说 那 女 蜗氏 炼石补天 之 时 ， 于 大 荒山 无稽 崖 炼成 高 十二 丈 、 见方 二十四丈 大 的 顽石 三万 六千五百 零 一块 ， 那 蜗皇 只用 了 三万 六千五百 块 ， 单单 剩下 一块 未 用 ， 弃 在 青填峰 下 。,"Long ago , when the goddess Nii-wa was repairing the sky , she melted down a great quantity of rock and , on the Incredible Crags of the Great Fable Mountains , moulded the amalgam into thirty-six thousand , five hundred and one large building blocks , each measuring seventy-two feet by a hundred and forty-four feet square . She used thirty-six thousand five hundred of these blocks in the course of her building operations , leaving a single odd block unused , which lay , all on its own , at the foot of Greensickness Peak in the aforementioned mountains ."
谁知 此 石 自经 锻炼 之后 ， 灵性 已 通 ， 自去 自来 ， 可大可小 ， 因见 众石俱得补天 ， 独 自己 无才 ， 不得 入选 ， 遂 自怨 自愧 ， 日夜 悲哀 。,"Now this block of stone , having undergone the melting and moulding of a goddess , possessed magic powers . It could move about at will and could grow or shrink to any size it wanted . Observing that all the other blocks had been used for celestial repairs and that it was the only one to have been rejected as unworthy , it became filled with shame and resentment and passed its days in sorrow and lamentation ."
一日 ， 正当 嗟悼 之际 ， 俄 见 一 僧 一道 ， 远远 而 来 ， 生得 骨格 不凡 ， 丰神 迥异 ， 来到 这 青埂峰 下 ， 席地 坐谈 。,"One day , in the midst of its lamentings , it saw a monk and a Taoist approaching from a great distance , each of them remarkable for certain eccentricities of manner and appearance ."
见 着 这块 鲜莹 明洁 的 石头 ， 且 又 缩成 扇坠 一般 ， 甚 属 可爱 ；,"When they arrived at the foot of Greensickness Peak , they sat down on the ground and began to talk ."
那僧托 于 掌上 ， 笑 道 ： “ 形体 倒 也 是 个 灵物 了 ！,"The monk , catching sight of a lustrous , translucent stone - it was in fact the rejected building block which had now shrunk itself to the size of a fan-pendant and looked very attractive in its new shape - took it up on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a smile : ' Ha , I see you have magical properties !"
只是 没有 实在 的 好处 ， 须 得 再 镌 上 几个 字 ， 使 人人 见 了 便 知 你 是 件 奇物 ， 然后 携 你 到 那 昌明 隆盛 之 邦 、 诗礼 簪缨 之族 、 花柳 繁华 地 、 温柔 富贵 乡 那里 去 走一遭 。 ”,But nothing to recommend you . I shall have to cut a few words on you so that anyone seeing you will know at once that you are something special . After that I shall take you to a certain brilliant successful poetical cultivated aristocratic elegant delectable luxurious opulent locality on a little trip .
石头 听 了 大喜 ， 因 问 ： “ 不知 可 镌 何 字 ？,The stone was delighted . ' What words will you cut ?
携到 何方 ？,Where is this place you will take me to ?
望 乞 明示 。 ”,I beg to be enlightened . '
那僧笑 道 ： “ 你 且莫 问 ， 日后 自然 明白 。 ”,"' Do not ask , replied the monk with a laugh . ' You will know soon enough when the time comes . '"
说 毕 ， 便 袖 了 ， 同 那道人 飘然 而 去 ， 竟 不知 投向 何方 。,And with that he slipped the stone into his sleeve and set oft ' at a great pace with the Taoist . But where they both went to I have no idea .
又 不知 过 了 几世 几 劫 ， 因 有个 空空 道人 访道 求仙 ， 从 这 大 荒山 无稽 崖 青埂峰 下 经过 ， 忽 见 一块 大石 ， 上面 字迹 分明 ， 编述 历历 ；,"Countless aeons went by and a certain Taoist called Vanitas in quest of the secret of immortality chanced to be passing below that same Greensickness Peak in the Incredible Crags of the Great Fable Mountains when he caught sight of a large stone standing there , on which the characters of a long inscription were clearly discernible ."
空空 道人 乃 从头 一 看 ， 原来 是 无 才 补 天 、 幻形 入世 、 被 那 茫茫 大士 渺渺 真人 携入 红尘 、 引登 彼岸 的 一块 顽石 ：,"Vanitas read the inscription through from beginning to end and learned that this was a once lifeless stone block which had been found unworthy to repair the sky , but which had magically transformed its shape and been taken down by the Buddhist mahasattva Impervioso and the Taoist illuminate Mysterioso into the world of mortals , where it had lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and returning to the other shore ."
上面 叙 着 堕落 之 乡 ， 投胎 之 处 ， 以及 家庭 琐事 ， 闺阁 闲情 ， 诗词 谜语 ， 倒 还 全备 。,"The inscription named the country where it had been born , and went into considerable detail about its domestic life , youthful amours , and even the verses , mottoes and riddles it had written ."
只是 朝代 年纪 ， 失落 无考 。,All it lacked was the authentication of a dynasty and date .
后面 又 有 一 偈 云 ：,On the back of the stone was inscribed the following quatrain :
无才 可去 补 苍天 ，,Found unfit to repair the azure sky
枉入 红尘 若 许年 ；,Long years a foolish mortal man was I.
此 系 身前 身后事 ，,My life in both worlds on this stone is writ :
倩 谁 记去 作奇 传 ？,Pray who will copy out and publish it ?
空空 道人 看 了 一回 ， 晓得 这 石头 有些 来历 ， 遂 向 石头 说道 ： “ 石兄 ， 你 这 一段 故事 ， 据 你 自己 说来 ， 有些 趣味 ， 故 镌写 在 此 ， 意欲 闻世 传奇 ；,"From his reading of the inscription Vanitas realized that this was a stone of some consequence . Accordingly he addressed himself to it in the following manner : ' Brother Stone , according to what you yourself seem to imply in these verses , this story of yours contains matter of sufficient interest to merit publication and has been carved here with that end in view ."
据 我 看来 ， 第一件 ， 无 朝代 年纪 可 考 ， 第二件 ， 并 无 大贤 大忠 、 理 朝廷 、 治 风俗 的 善政 ， 其中 只不过 几个 异样 女子 ， 或 情 或 痴 ， 或 小 才 微善 ， 我 纵然 抄去 ， 也 算不得 一种 奇书 。 ”,"But as far as I can see ( a ) it has no discoverable dynastic period , and ( b ) it contains no examples of moral grandeur among its characters - no statesmanship , no social message of any kind . All I can find in it , in fact , are a number of females , conspicuous , if at all , only for their passion or folly or for some trifling talent or insignificant virtue . Even if I were to copy all this out , I can not see that it would make a very remarkable book . '"
石头 果然 答道 ： “ 我 师 何必 太痴 ！,"' Come , your reverence , ' said the stone ( for Vanitas had been correct in assuming that it could speak ) ' must you be so obtuse ?"
我 想 历来 野史 的 朝代 ， 无非 假借 ‘ 汉 ’ ‘ 唐 ’ 的 名色 ；,All the romances ever written have an artificial period setting - Han or Tang for the most part .
莫如 我 这 石头 所记 ， 不 借此 套 ， 只 按 自己 的 事体 情理 ， 反倒 新鲜 别致 。,"In refusing to make use of that stale old convention and telling my Story of the Stone exactly as it occurred , it seems to me that , far from depriving it of anything , I have given it a freshness these other books do not have ."
况且 那 野史 中 ， 或 讪谤 君相 ， 或 贬 人 妻女 ， 奸淫 凶恶 ， 不可胜数 ， 更 有 一种 风月 笔墨 ， 其 淫秽 污臭 ， 最易 坏人 子弟 。,"' Your so-called "" historical romances "" , consisting , as they do , of scandalous anecdotes about statesmen and emperors of bygone days and scabrous attacks on the reputations of long-dead gentlewomen , contain more wickedness and immorality than I care to mention . Still worse is the "" erotic novel "" , by whose filthy obscenities our young folk are all too easily corrupted ."
至于 才子佳人 等 书 ， 则 又 开口 ‘ 文君 ’ ， 满篇 ‘ 子建 ’ ， 千部一腔 ， 千人一面 ， 且 终 不能不 涉淫 滥 。,"And the "" boudoir romances "" , those dreary stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their different characters undistinguishable except by name ( all those ideally beautiful young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors ) - even they seem unable to avoid descending sooner or later into indecency ."
— — 在 作者 不过 要 写出 自己 的 两首 情诗 艳 赋来 ， 故假 捏出 男女 二人 名姓 ， 又 必旁添 一小 人 拨乱 其间 ， 如 戏 中 的 小丑 一般 。,"' The trouble with this last kind of romance is that it only gets written in the first place because the author requires a framework in which to show off his love-poems . He goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically , beginning with the names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character , a servant or the like , to make mischief between them , like the chou in a comedy ."
更 可厌 者 ， ‘ 之乎者也 ’ ， 非理 即 文 ， 大 不 近情 ， 自相矛盾 ：,"' What makes these romances even more detestable is the stilted , bombastic language - inanities dressed in pompous rhetoric , remote alike from nature and common sense and teeming with the grossest absurdities ."
竟 不如 我 这 半世 亲见亲闻 的 几个 女子 ， 虽 不敢 说 强似 前 代书 中 所有 之 人 ， 但 观 其 事迹 原委 ， 亦可 消愁 破闷 ；,"' Surely my ' number of females ' , whom I spent half a lifetime studying with my own eyes and ears , are preferable to this kind of stuff ? I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time ; I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy ."
至于 几首 歪诗 ， 也 可以 喷饭 供酒 ；,And even the inelegant verses with which my story is interlarded could serve to entertain and amuse on those convivial occasions when rhymes and riddles are in demand .
其间 离合悲欢 ， 兴衰 际遇 ， 俱 是 按迹循踪 ， 不敢 稍加 穿凿 ， 至 失 其 真 。,"' All that my story narrates , the meetings and partings , the joys and sorrows , the ups and downs of fortune , are recorded exactly as they happened . I have not dared to add the tiniest bit of touching-up , for fear of losing the true picture ."
只 愿 世人 当 那 醉 余 睡醒 之 时 ， 或 避事 消愁 之际 ， 把 此一 玩 ， 不 但是 洗 旧 翻新 ， 却 也 省 了 些 寿命 筋力 ， 不 更 去 谋虚逐妄 了 。,"' My only wish is that men in the world below may sometimes pick up this tale when they are recovering from sleep or drunkenness , or when they wish to escape from business worries or a fit of the dumps , and in doing so find not only mental refreshment but even perhaps , if they will heed its lesson and abandon their vain and frivolous pursuits , some small arrest in the deterioration of their vital forces ."
我 师意 为 如何 ？ ”,What does your reverence say to that ? '
空空 道人 听 如此 说 ， 思忖 半晌 ， 将 这 《 石头记 》 再 检阅 一遍 ， 因见 上面 大旨 不过 谈情 ， 亦 只是 实录 其 事 ， 绝无 伤 时 诲淫 之病 ， 方 从头至尾 抄写 回来 ， 闻世 传奇 。,"For a long time Vanitas stood lost in thought , pondering this speech . He then subjected the Story of the Stone to a careful second reading . He could see that its main theme was love ; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events ; and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt ."
从此 空空 道人 因 空见色 ， 由 色 生情 ， 传情 入色 ， 自色 悟空 ， 遂 改名 情僧 ， 改 《 石头记 》 为 《 情僧 录 》 。,"He therefore copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a publisher . As a consequence of all this , Vanitas , starting off in the Void ( which is Truth ) came to the contemplation of Form ( which is Illusion ) ; and from Form engendered Passion ; and by communicating Passion , entered again into Form ; and from Form awoke to the Void ( which is Truth ) . He therefore changed his name from Vanitas to Brother Amor , or the Passionate Monk , ( because he had approached Truth by way of Passion ) , and changed the title of the book from The Story of the Stone to The Tale of Brother Amor ."
东鲁 孔梅 溪题 日 《 风月 宝鉴 》 。,Old Kong Mei-xi from the homeland of Confucius called the book 4 Mirror for the Romantic .
至 吴玉峰 题 曰 《 红楼梦 》 。,Wu Yu-feng called it 4 Dream of Golden Days .
后 因 曹雪芹 于悼红轩 中 ， 披阅 十载 ， 增删 五次 ， 纂成 目录 ， 分出 章回 ， 又题 曰 《 金陵 十二钗 》 ； 并题一绝 。,"Cao Xueqin in his Nostalgia Studio worked on it for ten years , in the course of which he rewrote it no less than five times , dividing it into chapters , composing chapter headings , renaming it The Twelve Beauties of Jinling , and adding an introductory quatrain ."
至 脂砚斋 ［ 甲戌 ］ 抄阅 再 评 ， 仍 用 《 石头记 》 。,Red Inkstone restored the original title when he recopied the book and added his second set of annotations to it .
即此 便是 《 石头记 》 的 缘起 。 诗云 ：,"This , then , is a true account of how The Story of the Stone came to be written ."
满纸 荒唐言 ，,Puges full o idle words
一把 辛酸泪 ！,Penned with hot and bitter tears :
都云 作者 痴 ，,Al men call the author fool ;
谁 解 其中 味 ？,None his secret message hears .
《 石头记 》 缘起 既 明 ， 正 不知 那 石头 上面 记 着 何人 何事 ， 看官 请 听 — —,"The origin of The Story of the Stone has now been made clear . The same can not , however , be said of the characters and events which it recorded . Gentle reader , have patience !"
按 那 石上书 云 ：,This is how the inscription began :
当日 地陷 东南 ， 这 东南 有个 姑苏 城 ， 城中 阊 门 ， 最 是 红尘 中 一二 等 富贵 风流 之 地 。,"Long , long ago the world was tilted downwards towards the south-east ; and in that lower-lying south-easterly part of the earth there is a city called Soochow ; and in Soochow the district around the Chang-men Gate is reckoned one of the two or three wealthiest and most fashionable quarters in the world of men ."
这 阊 门外 有个 十里 街 ， 街内 有个 仁清巷 ， 巷内 有个 古庙 ， 因 地方 狭窄 ， 人 皆 呼作 “ 葫芦 庙 ” 。,"Outside the Chang-men Gate is a wide thorough-fare called Worldly Way ; and somewhere off Worldly Way is an area called Carnal Lane . There is an old temple in the Carnal Lane area which , because of the way it is bottled up inside a narrow cul-de-sac , is referred to locally as Bottle-gourd Temple ."
庙 旁 住 着 一家 乡宦 ， 姓 甄 名费 ， 字士 隐 ； 嫡妻 封氏 ， 性情 贤淑 ， 深 明礼义 ， 家中 虽不甚 富贵 ， 然 本地 也 推 他 为 望族 了 。,"Next door to Bottle-gourd Temple lived a gentleman of private means called Zhen Shi-yin and his wife Feng-shi , a kind , good woman with a profound sense of decency and decorum . The household was not a particularly wealthy one , but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry as the leading family in the neighbourhood ."
因 这 甄士隐 禀性 恬淡 ， 不 以 功名 为 念 ， 每日 只以 观 花种 竹 、 酌酒 吟诗 为 乐 ， 倒 是 神仙 一流 人物 ； 只是 一件 不足 ： 年过半百 ， 膝下 无儿 ； 只有 一 女 ， 乳名 英莲 ， 年 方 三岁 。,"Zhen Shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totally unambitious person . He devoted his time to his garden and to the pleasures of wine and poetry . Except for a single flaw , his existence could , indeed , have been described as an idyllic one . The flaw was that , although already past fifty , he had no son , only a little girl , just two years old , whose name was Ying-lian ."
一日 炎夏 永昼 ， 士隐 于 书房 闲坐 ， 手 倦 抛 书 ， 伏 几 盹 睡 ， 不觉 蒙胧 中 走 至 一处 ， 不辨 是 何 地方 。 忽 见 那 厢 来 了 一 僧 一道 ， 且 行 且 谈 ， 只 听 道人 问道 ： “ 你 携 了 此物 ， 意欲 何往 ？ ”,"Once , during the tedium of a burning summer 's day , Shi-yin was sitting idly in his study . The book had slipped from his nerveless grasp and his head had nodded down onto the desk in a doze . While in this drowsy state he seemed to drift off to some place he could not identify , where he became aware of a monk and a Taoist walking along and talking as they went . ' Where do you intend to take that thing you are carrying ? ' the Taoist was asking ."
那僧笑 道 ： “ 你 放心 ！,' Do not you worry about him ! ' replied the monk with a laugh .
如今 现有 一段 风流 公案 ， 正 该 了结 ， 这 一干 风流 冤家 尚未 投胎 入世 ， 趁此机会 ， 就 将 此物 夹带 于 中 ， 使 他 去 经历 经历 。 ”,' There is a batch of lovesick souls awaiting incarnation in the world below whose fate is due to be decided this very day . I intend to take advantage of this opportunity to slip our little friend in amongst them and let him have a taste of human life along with the rest .
那道人 道 ： “ 原来 近日 风流 冤家 又 将 造劫 历世 ， 但 不知 起于 何处 ？,"' Well , well , so another lot of these amorous wretches is about to enter the vale of tears , ' said the Taoist . ' How did all this begin ?"
落 于 何方 ？ ”,And where are the souls to be reborn ? '
那僧道 ： “ 此事 说来 好笑 。,"' You will laugh when I tell you , ' said the monk ."
只 因 当年 这个 石头 ， 蜗皇 未 用 ， 自己 却 也 落得 逍遥自在 ， 各处 去 游玩 ， 一日 来到 警幻 仙子 处 ， 那 仙子 知 他 有些 来历 ， 因 留 他 在 赤霞 宫中 ， 名 他 为 赤霞宫 神瑛侍者 。,"' ' When this stone was left unused by the goddess , he found himself at a loose end and took to wandering about all over the place for want of better to do , until one day his wanderings took him to the place where the fairy Disenchantment lives . ' Now Disenchantment could tell that there was something unusual about this stone , so she kept him there in her Sunset Glow Palace and gave him the honorary title of Divine Luminescent Stone-in-Waiting in the Court of Sunset Glow ."
他 却常 在 西方 灵 河岸 上 行走 ， 看见 那灵 河岸 上 三生石 畔 有 棵 ， 绛 珠 仙草 二十分 娇娜 可爱 ， 遂 日 以 甘露 灌溉 ， 这 ‘ 绛 珠草 ’ 始得 久 延 岁月 。,"' But most of his time he spent west of Sunset Glow exploring the banks of the Magic River . There , by the Rock of Rebirth , he found the beautiful Crimson Pearl Flower , for which he conceived such a fancy that he took to watering her every day with sweet dew , thereby conferring on her the gift of life ."
后来 既 受 天地 精华 ， 复 得 甘露 滋养 ， 遂 脱 了 草木 之 胎 ， 幻化 人形 ， 仅仅 修成 女体 ， 终日 游于 ‘ 离恨 天 ’ 外 ； 饥餐 ‘ 秘情 果 ’ ， 渴 饮 ‘ 灌愁 水 ’ 。,"' Crimson Pearl 's substance was composed of the purest cosmic essences , so she was already half-divine ; and now thanks to the vitalizing effect of the sweet dew , she was able to shed her vegetable shape and assume the form of a girl . ' This fairy girl wandered about outside the Realm of Separation , eating the Secret Passion Fruit when she was hungry and drinking from the Pool of Sadness when she was thirsty ."
只 因 尚未 酬报 灌溉 之德 ， 故 甚至 五 内 郁结 着 一段 缠绵 不尽 之 意 ， 常 说 ‘ 自己 受 了 他 雨露 之 惠 ， 我 并 无此 水 可 还 ， 他 若 下世 为 人 ， 我 也 同去 走一遭 ， 但 把 我 一生 所有 的 眼泪 还 他 ， 也 还 得 过 了 。 ’,"The consciousness that she owed the stone something for his kindness in watering her began to prey on her mind and ended by becoming an obsession . "" I have no sweet dew here that I can repay him with , "" she would say to herself "" The only way in which I could perhaps repay him would be with the tears shed during the whole of a mortal lifetime if he and I were ever to be reborn as humans in the world below . """
因此 一事 ， 就 勾出 多少 风流 冤家 都 要 下凡 ， 造历 幻缘 ； 那 ‘ 绛 珠 仙草 ’ 也 在 其中 。,"' Because of this strange affair , Disenchantment has got together a group of amorous young souls , of which Crimson Pearl is one , and intends to send them down into the world to take part in the great illusion of human lite ."
今日 这 石正 该 下世 ， 我 来 特地 将 他 仍 带到 警幻 仙子 案 前 ， 给 他 挂 了 号 ， 同 这些 情鬼 下凡 ， 一 了 此案 。 ”,"And as today happens to be the day on which this stone is fated to go into the world too , I am taking him with me to Disenchantment 's tribunal for the purpose of getting him registered and sent down to earth with the rest of these romantic creatures . '"
那道人 道 ： “ 果是 好笑 ， 从来不 闻有 ‘ 还泪 ’ 之 说 ！,' How very amusing ! ' said the Taoist . ' I have certainly never heard of a debt of tears before .
趁此 你 我 何不 也 下世 度脱 几个 ， 岂不是 一场 功德 ？ ”,Why should not the two of us take advantage of this opportunity to go down into the world ourselves and save a few souls ? It would be a work of merit . '
那僧道 ： “ 正合 吾 意 。,"' That is exactly what I was thinking , ' said the monk ."
你 且 同 我 到 警幻 仙子 宫中 ， 将 这 ‘ 蠢物 ’ 交割 清楚 ， 待 这 一干 风流 孽 鬼 下世 ， 你 我 再 去 。,"' Come with me to Disenchantment 's palace to get this absurd creature cleared . Then , when this last batch of romantic idiots goes down , you and I can go down with them ."
— — 如今 有 一半 落尘 ， 然 犹 未 全集 。 ”,At present about half have already been born . They await this last batch to make up the number . '
道人 道 ： “ 既 如此 ， 便 随 你 去 来 。 ”,"' Very good , I will go with you then , said the Taoist ."
却说 甄士隐 俱 听 得 明白 ， 遂 不禁 上前 施礼 ， 笑 问道 ： “ 二位 仙师 请 了 。 ”,"Shi-yin heard all this conversation quite clearly , and curiosity impelled him to go forward and greet the two reverend gentlemen ."
那僧道 也 忙 答礼 相问 ， 士隐 因 说道 ： “ 适闻 仙师 所谈 因果 ， 实 人世 罕闻 者 ；,"They returned his greeting and asked him what he wanted . ' It is not often that one has the opportunity of listening to a discussion of the operations of karma such as the one I have just been privileged to overhear , ' said Shi-yin ."
但 弟子 愚拙 ， 不能 洞悉 明白 ， 若蒙 大开痴顽 ， 备 细一闻 ， 弟子 洗耳 谛听 ， 稍 能 警省 ， 亦可 免 沉沦 之 苦 了 。 ”,"' Unfortunately I am a man of very limited understanding and have not been able to derive the full benefit from your conversation . If you would have the very great kindness to enlighten my benighted understanding with a somewhat fuller account of what you were discussing , I can promise you the most devout attention . I feel sure that your teaching would have a salutary effect on me and - who knows - might save me from the pains of hell . '"
二仙 笑 道 ： “ 此 乃 玄机 ， 不可 预泄 。,The reverend gentlemen laughed . ' These are heavenly mysteries and may not be divulged .
到 那时 只 不要 忘 了 我 二人 ， 便 可 跳出火坑 矣 。 ”,"But if you wish to escape from the fiery pit , you have only to remember us when the time comes , and all will be well . '"
士隐 听 了 ， 不便 再 问 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 玄机 固 不可 泄露 ， 但 适云 ‘ 蠢物 ’ ， 不知 为何 ？,"Shi-yin saw that it would be useless to press them . ' Heavenly mysteries must not , of course , be revealed . But might one perhaps inquire what the ' absurd creature ' is that you were talking about ?"
或 可得 见否 ？ ”,Is it possible that I might be allowed to see it ? '
那僧 说 ： “ 若 问 此物 ， 倒有 一面之缘 。 ” 说 着 取出 递 与 士隐 。,"' Oh , as for that , said the monk : ' I think it is on the cards for you to have a look at him , ' and he took the object from his sleeve and handed it to Shi-yin ."
士隐 接 了 看 时 ， 原来 是 块 鲜明 美玉 ， 上面 字迹 分明 ， 镌 着 “ 通灵宝玉 ” 四 字 。,"Shi-yin took the object from him and saw that it was a clear , beautiful jade on one side of which were carved the words ' Magic Jade ' ."
后面 还有 几行 小字 ， 正 欲 细看 时 ， 那僧 便 说 “ 已 到 幻境 ” ， 就 强 从 手中 夺 了 去 ， 和 那道人 竟 过 了 一座 大石 牌坊 ， — — 上面 大书四字 ， 乃是 “ 太虚幻境 ” ；,"There were several columns of smaller characters on the back , which Shi-yin was just going to examine more closely when the monk , with a cry of ' Here we are , at the frontier of Illusion ' , snatched the stone from him and disappeared , with the Taoist , through a big stone archway above which THE LAND OF ILLUSION was written in large characters ."
两边 又 有 一副 对联 道 ：,A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed vertically on either side of the arch :
假作 真时 真 亦 假 ，,Truth becomes fiction when the fiction 's true ;
无为 有 处有 还 无 。,Real becomes not-real where the unreal 's real .
士隐 意欲 也 跟着 过去 ， 方 举步 时 ， 忽 听 一声 霹雳 ， 若 山崩地陷 ， 士隐 大叫 一声 ， — — 定睛 看 时 ， 只见 烈日炎炎 ， 芭蕉 冉冉 ， 梦 中 之 事 ， 便 忘 了 一半 。 又 见 奶母 抱 了 英莲 走来 。,"Shi-yin was on the point of following them through the archway when suddenly a great clap of thunder seemed to shake the earth to its very foundations , making him cry out in alarm . And there he was sitting in his study , the contents of his dream already half forgotten , with the sun still blazing on the ever-rustling plantains outside , and the wet-nurse at the door with his little daughter Ying-lian in her arms ."
士隐 见 女儿 越 发生 得 粉装玉琢 ， 乖觉 可喜 ， 便 伸手 接 来 ， 抱 在 怀中 ， 斗 他 玩耍 一回 ， 又 带 至 街前 看 那 过会 的 热闹 。,"Her delicate little pink-and-white face seemed dearer to him than ever at that moment , and he stretched out his arms to take her and hugged her to him . After playing with her for a while at his desk , he carried her out to the front of the house to watch the bustle in the street ."
方欲 进来 时 ， 只见 从 那边 来 了 一 僧 一道 ： 那僧 癞头 跣足 ， 那 道 跛足 蓬头 ， 疯疯癫癫 ， 挥霍 谈笑 而至 。,"He was about to go in again when he saw a monk and a Taoist approaching , the monk scabby-headed and barefoot , the Taoist tousle-haired and limping . They were behaving like madmen , shouting with laughter and gesticulating wildly as they walked along ."
及 到 了 他 门前 ， 看见 士隐 抱 着 英莲 ， 那僧 便 大哭 起来 ， 又 向士隐 道 ： “ 施主 ， 你 把 这 有 命 无 运 、 累及 爹娘 之 物 抱 在 怀内 作 甚 ？ ”,"When this strange pair reached Shi-yin 's door and saw him standing there holding Ying-lian , the monk burst into loud sobs . ' Patron , ' he said , addressing Shi-yin , ' what are you doing , holding in your arms that ill-fated creature who is destined to involve both her parents in her own misfortune ? '"
士隐 听 了 ， 知是 疯话 ， 也 不睬 他 ， 那僧 还 说 ： “ 舍 我 罢 ！ 舍 我 罢 ！ ”,Shi-yin realized that he was listening to the words of a madman and took no notice . But the monk persisted : ' Give her to me ! Give her to me ! '
士隐 不耐烦 ， 便 抱 着 女儿 转身 才 要 进去 ， 那僧乃 指着 他 大笑 ， 口内 念 了 四句 言词 ， 道 是 ：,"Shi-yin was beginning to lose patience and , clasping his little girl tightly to him , turned on his heel and was about to re-enter the house when the monk pointed his finger at him , roared with laughter , and then proceeded to intone the following verse :"
惯养 娇生 笑 你 痴 ，,"' Fond man , your pampered child to cherish so -"
菱花 空 对 雪 新 淅 ；,That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow !
好 防 佳节 元宵 后 ，,"Beware the high feast c the fifteenth day ,"
便是 烟消火灭 时 。,When all in smoke and fire shall pass away ! ' '
士隐 听 得 明白 ， 心下 犹豫 ， 意欲 问 他 来历 ， 只 听 道人 说道 ： “ 你 我 不必 同行 ， 就此 分手 ， 各 干 营生 去 罢 ， 三 劫后 我 在 北 邙山 等 你 ， 会 齐 了 ， 同 往 太虚幻境 销号 。 ”,"Shi-yin heard all this quite plainly and was a little worried by it . He was thinking of asking the monk what lay behind these puzzling words when he heard the Taoist say , ' We do not need to stay together . Why do not we part company here and each go about his own business ? Three kalpas from now I shall wait for you on Bei-mang Hill . Having joined forces again there , we can go together to the Land of Illusion to sign off . '"
那僧道 ： “ 最妙 ， 最妙 ！ ”,' Excellent ! ' said the other .
说 毕 ， 二人 一去 再 不见 个 踪影 了 。,And the two of them went off and soon were both lost to sight .
士隐 心中 此时 自忖 ： 这 两个 人 必 有 来历 ， 很 该 问 他一 问 ， 如今 后悔 却 已 晚 了 。,"' There must have been something behind all this , ' thought Shi-yin to himself . ' I really ought to have asked him what he meant , but now it is too late . '"
这 士隐 正在 痴想 ， 忽 见 隔壁 葫芦 庙 内 寄居 的 一个 穷 儒 — — 姓 贾名化 、 表字 时 飞 、 别号 雨村 的 走来 。,"He was still standing outside his door brooding when Jia Yu-cun , the poor student who lodged at the Bottle-gourd Temple next door , came up to him ."
这 贾雨村 原系 湖州 人氏 ， 也 是 诗书 仕宦 之族 ， 因 他 生于 末世 ， 父母 祖宗 根基 已尽 ， 人口 衰丧 ， 只 剩得 他 一身 一口 ， 在 家乡 无益 ， 因 进京 求取 功名 ， 再整 基业 。,"Yu-cun was a native of Hu-zhou and came from a family of scholars and bureaucrats which had , however , fallen on bad times when Yu-cun was born . The family fortunes on both his father 's and mother 's side had all been spent , and the members of the family had themselves gradually died off until only Yu-cun was left . There were no prospects for him in his home town , so he had set of for the capital , in search of fame and fortune ."
自 前 岁 来 此 ， 又 淹 蹇 住 了 ， 暂 寄 庙 中 安身 ， 每日 卖文 作字 为生 ， 故士 隐常 与 他 交接 。,"Unfortunately he had got no further than Soochow when his funds ran out , and he had now been living there in poverty for a year , lodging in this temple and keeping himself alive by working as a copyist . For this reason Shi-yin saw a great deal of his company ."
当 下雨 村 见 了 士隐 ， 忙 施礼 陪笑 道 ： “ 老先生 倚门 伫望 ， 敢 街市 上有 甚 新闻 么 ？ ”,"As soon as he caught sight of Shi-yin , Yu-cun clasped his hands in greeting and smiled ingratiatingly . ' I could see you standing there gazing , sir . Has anything been happening in the street ? '"
士隐 笑 道 ： “ 非 也 ， 适因 小女 啼哭 ， 引 他 出来 作耍 ， — — 正是 无聊 的 很 ， 贾兄 来得 正好 。,"' No , no , ' said Shi-yin . ' It just happened that my little girl was crying , so I brought her out here to amuse her . Your coming is most opportune , dear boy . I was beginning to feel most dreadfully bored ."
请入 小斋 ， 彼此 俱 可消 此 永 昼 。 ”,"Will not you come into my little den , and we can help each other to while away this tedious hot day ? '"
说 着 ， 便 令人 送 女儿 进去 ， 自 携 了 雨村 ， 来 至 书房 中 ， 小童 献 茶 ， — — 方 谈 得 三五句 话 ， 忽 家人 飞报 ： “ 严老爷 来 拜 。 ”,"So saying , he called for a servant to take the child indoors , while he himself took Yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study , where his boy served them both with tea . But they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words before one of the servants rushed in to say that ' Mr Yan had come to pay a call . '"
士隐 慌忙 起身 谢道 ： “ 恕 巡驾 之 罪 ， 且 请 略 坐 ， 弟 即 来 奉陪 。 ”,"Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and excused himself : ' T seem to have brought you here under false pretences . I do hope you will forgive me . If you do not mind sitting on your own here for a moment , I shall be with you directly . '"
雨村 起身 也 让 道 ： “ 老先生 请便 。,"Yu-cun rose to his feet too . ' Please do not distress yourself on my account , sir ."
晚生 乃 常造 之 客 ， 稍候 何妨 。 ”,"I am a regular visitor here and can easily wait a bit . But by the time he had finished saying this ,"
说 着 士隐 已 出 前厅 去 了 。,Shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guest-room .
这里 雨村 且 翻弄 诗籍 解闷 ， 忽 听 得 窗外 有 女子 嗽 声 ， 雨村 遂 起身 往 外 一看 ， 原来 是 一个 丫鬟 在 那里 掐 花儿 ：,"Left to himself , Yu-cun was flicking through some of Shi-yin 's books of poetry in order to pass the time , when he heard a woman 's cough outside the window . Immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was . The cough appeared to have come from a maid who was picking flowers in the garden ."
生 的 仪容 不俗 ， 眉目清秀 ， 虽 无 十分 姿色 ， 却 也 有 动人 之 处 ， 雨村 不觉 看 得 呆 了 。,"She was an unusually good-looking girl with a rather refined face : not a great beauty , by any means , but with something striking about her . Yu-cun gazed at her spellbound ."
那 甄家 丫鬟 掐 了 花儿 ， 方欲 走时 ， 猛 抬头 见 窗内 有人 ：,"Having now finished picking her flowers , this anonymous member of the Zhen household was about to go in again when , on some sudden impulse , she raised her head and caught sight of a man standing in the window ."
敝 巾 旧 服 ， 虽是 贫窘 ， 然 生 得 腰 圆 背 厚 ， 面阔 口方 ， 更 兼 剑眉 星眼 ， 直鼻方腮 。,"His hat was frayed and his clothing threadbare ; yet , though obviously poor , he had a fine , manly physique and handsome , well-proportioned features ."
这 丫鬟 忙 转身 回避 ， 心下 自想 ： “ 这 人生 的 这样 雄壮 ， 却 又 这样 褴褛 ：,"The maid hastened to remove herself from this male presence ; but as she went she thought to herself , ' ' What a fine-looking man ! But so shabby !"
我家 并 无 这样 贫窘 亲友 ， 想 他 定 是 主人 常 说 的 什么 贾雨村 了 ， 一 怪 道 又 说 他 必非 久困之人 ， 每每 有意 帮助 周济 他 ， 只是 没什么 机会 。 ”,The family hasn ' t got any friends or relations as poor as that . It must be that Jia Yu-cun the master is always on about . No wonder he says that he will not stay poor long . I remember hearing him say that he is often wanted to help him but hasn ' t yet found an opportunity . '
如此 一 想 ， 不免 又 回头 一两次 。,And thinking these thoughts she could not forbear to turn back for another peep or two .
雨村 见 他 回头 ， 便 以为 这 女子 心中 有意 于 他 ， 遂 狂喜 不禁 ， 自谓 此 女子 必 是 个 巨眼 英豪 、 风尘 中 之 知己 。,"Yu-cun saw her turn back and , at once assuming that she had taken a fancy to him , was beside himself with delight . What a perceptive young woman she must be , he thought , to have seen the genius underneath the rags ! A real friend in trouble !"
一时 小童 进来 ， 雨村 打听 得 前面 留饭 ， 不可 久 待 ， 遂 从 夹道 中 自便 门 出去 了 。,"After a while the boy came in again and Yu-cun elicited from him that the visitor in the front room was now staying to dinner . It was obviously out of the question to wait much longer , so he slipped down the passage-way at the side of the house and let himself out by the back gate ."
士隐 待客 既 散 ， 知雨村 已 去 ， 便 也 不 去 再 邀 。,"Nor did Shi-yin invite him round again when , having at last seen off his visitor , he learned that Yu-cun had already left ."
一日 到 了 中秋佳节 ， 士隐 家宴 已 毕 ， 又 另具 一席 于 书房 ， 自己 步 月 至 庙 中 来 邀 雨 村 。,"But then the Mid Autumn festival arrived and , after the family convivialities were over , Shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to invite Yu-cun , walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight ."
原来 雨村 自 那日 见 了 甄家 丫鬟 曾 回顾 他 两次 ， 自谓 是 个 知己 ， 便 时刻 放在心上 ， 今 又 正值 中秋 ， 不免 对 月 有 怀 ， 因而 口 占 五言 一律 云 ：,"Ever since the day the Zhens ' maid had , by looking back twice over her shoulder , convinced him that she was a friend , Yu-cun had had the girl very much on his mind , and now that it was festival time , the full moon of Mid Autumn lent an inspiration to his romantic impulses which finally resulted in the following octet :"
未卜 三生 愿 ，,"Ere on ambition 's path my feet are set ,"
频 添 一段 愁 ；,Sorrow comes often this poor heart to fret .
闷 来时 敛 额 ，,"Yet , as my brow contracted with new care ,"
行 去 几 回头 。,"Was there not one who , parting , turned to stare ?"
自 顾风 前 影 ，,"Dare I , that grasp at shadowes in the wind ,"
谁 堪 月 下传 ？,"Hope , underneath the moon , a friend to find ?"
蟾光 如 有意 ，,"Bright orb , if with my plight you sympathize ,"
先上 玉人 楼 。,Shine first upon the chamber where she lies . '
雨村吟 罢 ， 因 又 思及 平生 抱负 ， 苦未 逢时 ， 乃 又 搔首 对 天 长叹 ， 复高 吟 一 联云 ：,"Having delivered himself of this masterpiece , Yu-cun 's thoughts began to run on his unrealized ambitions and , after much head-scratching and many heavenward glances accompanied by heavy sighs , he produced the following couplet , reciting it in a loud , ringing voice which caught the ear of Shi-yin , who chanced at that moment to be arriving :"
玉 在 椟 中 求善 价 ，,' The jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy .
钗 于 奁 内 待 时 飞 。,"The jade pin in the drawer hides , waiting its time to fly . '"
恰值 士隐 走来 听见 ， 笑 道 ： “ 雨村兄 真 抱负不凡 也 ！ ”,"Shi-yin smiled . ' You are a man of no mean ambition , Yu-cun . '"
雨村 忙 笑 道 ： “ 不敢 ， 不过 偶 吟 前人 之句 ， 何期 过誉 如此 。 ”,' Oh no ! Yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly . ' You are too flattering . I was merely reciting at random from the lines of some old poet .
因 问 ： “ 老先生 何兴 至此 ？ ”,"But what brings you here , sir ? '"
士隐 笑 道 ： “ 今夜 中秋 ， 俗谓 ‘ 团圆 之 节 ’ ， 想 尊 兄 旅 寄 僧房 ， 不无 寂寥 之 感 ， 故 特具 小酌 ， 邀 兄 到 敝 斋 一 饮 ， 不知 可 纳芹 意否 ？ ”,"' Tonight is Mid Autumn night , ' said Shi-yin . ' People call it the Festival of Reunion . It occurred to me that you might be feeling rather lonely here in your monkery , so I have arranged for the two of us to take a little wine together in my study . I hope you will not refuse to join me . '"
雨村 听 了 ， 并 不 推辞 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 既 蒙 谬 爱 ， 何敢 拂 此 盛情 。 ”,"Yu-cun made no polite pretence of declining . ' Your kindness is more than I deserve , ' he said . ' I accept gratetully . '"
说 着 便 同士 隐复 过 这边 书院 中 来 了 。,And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door .
须臾 茶 毕 ， 早已 设 下 杯盘 ， 那 美酒佳肴 ， 自不必说 。,"Soon they had finished their tea . Wine and various choice dishes were brought in and placed on the table , already laid out with cups , plates , and so forth , and the two men took their places and began to drink ."
二人 归 坐 ， 先是 款 酌慢 饮 ， 渐次 谈至兴 浓 ， 不觉 飞觥献斝 起来 。,"At first they were rather slow and ceremonious ; but gradually , as the conversation grew more animated , their potations too became more reckless and uninhibited ."
当时 街坊 上 家家 萧管 ， 户户 笙歌 ， 当头 一轮 明月 ， 飞彩 凝辉 ， 二人 愈 添 豪兴 ， 酒 到 杯 干 。 雨村 此时 已有 七八分 酒意 ， 狂兴 不禁 ， 乃 对 月寓 怀 ， 口 占 一绝云 ：,"The sounds of music and singing which could now be heard from every house in the neighbourhood and the full moon which shone with cold brilliance overhead seemed to increase their elation , so that the cups were emptied almost as soon as they touched their lips , and Yu-cun , who was already a sheet or so in the wind , was seized with an irrepressible excitement to which he presently gave expression in the form of a quatrain , ostensibly on the subject of the moon , but really about the ambition he had hitherto been at some pains to conceal :"
时逢 三五 便 团圆 ，,"In thrice five nights her perfect O is made ,"
满 把 清光 护玉 栏 ；,Whose cold light bathes each marble balustrade .
天上 一轮 才 捧 出 ，,"As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways ,"
人间 万 姓 仰头 看 。,On earth ten thousand heads look IIP and gaze . '
士隐 听 了 大叫 ： “ 妙极 ！,' Bravo ! ' said Shi-yin loudly .
弟 每 谓 兄 必非 久居人下 者 ， 今 所 吟 之 句 ， 飞腾 之 兆 已 见 ， 不日 可接 履于 云霄 之上 了 。,"' I have always insisted that you were a young fellow who would go up in the world , and now , in these verses you have just recited , I see an augury of your ascent . In no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds !"
可贺 ， 可贺 ！ ”,This calls for a drink !
乃 亲 斟 一斗 为 贺 。,"And , saying this , he poured Yu-cun a large cup of wine ."
雨村 饮干 ， 忽 叹 道 ： “ 非 晚生 酒后 狂言 ， 若论 时尚 之 学 ， 晚生 也 或 可去 充数 挂名 ， 只是 如今 行李 路费 ， 一概 无措 ， 神京 路远 ， 非 赖 卖字 撰文 即 能 到 得 — — ”,"Yu-cun drained the cup , then , surprisingly , sighed : ' Do not imagine the drink is making me boastful , but I really do believe that if it were just a question of having the sort of qualifications now in demand , I should stand as good a chance as any of getting myself on to the list of candidates . The trouble is that I simply have no means of laying my hands on the money that would be needed for lodgings and travel expenses . The journey to the capital is a long one , and the sort of money I can earn from my copying is not enough -"
士隐 不待 说完 ， 便 道 ： “ 兄 何不 早 言 ， 弟 已久 有 此 意 ， 但 每 遇 兄 时 ， 并未 谈及 ， 故 未敢 唐突 。,"' Why ever did not you say this before ? ' said Shi-yin interrupting him . ' I have long wanted to do something about this , but on all the occasions I have met you previously , the conversation has never got round to this subject , and I haven ' t liked to broach it for fear of offending you ."
今 既 如此 ， 弟 虽 不 才 ， 义利 二 字 ， 却 还 识 得 ；,"Well , now we know where we are . I am not a very clever man , but at least I know the right thing to do when I see it ."
且 喜明 岁 正当 大 比 ， 兄宜 作速入 都 ， 春闱 一捷 ， 方 不负 兄 之 所学 。,"Luckily , the next Triennial is only a few months ahead . You must go to the capital without delay . A spring examination triumph will make you feel that all your studying has been worth while ."
其 盘费 余 事 ， 弟 自 代为 处置 ， 亦 不枉 兄 之 谬识 矣 。 ”,I shall take care of all your expenses . It is the least return I can make for your friendship .
当下 即 命 小童 进去 速 封 五十两 白银 并 两套 冬衣 ， 又 云 ： “ 十九日 乃 黄道 之期 ， 兄 可 即 买 舟 西上 ， 待 雄飞 高举 ， 明冬 再晤 ， 岂非 大快 之 事 ！ ”,"And there and then he instructed his boy to go with all speed and make up a parcel of fifty taels of the best refined silver and two suits of winter clothes . ' The almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travelling , ' he went on , addressing Yu-cun again . ' You can set about hiring a boat for the journey straight away . How delightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates !"
雨村 收 了 银衣 ， 不过 略谢一语 ， 并 不介意 ， 仍 是 吃酒 谈笑 。,"Yu-cun accepted the silver and the clothes with only the most perfunctory word of thanks and without , apparently , giving them a further moment 's thought , for he continued to drink and laugh and talk as if nothing had happened ."
那天 已 交 三 鼓 ， 二人 方散 。,It was well after midnight before they broke up .
士隐 送 雨 村 去 后 ， 回房 一觉 ， 直至 红日三竿 方醒 ， 因 思 昨夜 之 事 ， 意欲 写荐 书 两封 与 雨村 带至 都 中 去 ， 使 雨 村 投 谒 个 仕宦 之家 为 寄身 之 地 ， 因使 人 过去 请 时 ， 那 家人 回来 说 ：,"After seeing Yu-cun off , Shi-yin went to bed and slept without a break until the sun was high in the sky next morning . When he awoke , his mind was still running on the conversation of the previous night . He thought he would write a couple of introductory letters for Yu-cun to take with him to the capital , and arrange for him to call on the family of an official he was acquainted with who might be able to put him up ; but when he sent a servant to invite him over , the servant brought back word from the temple as follows :"
“ 和尚 说 ： ‘ 贾爷 今日 五 鼓 已 进京 去 了 ， 也 曾 留下 话 与 和尚 转达 老爷 ， 说 ： “ 读书人 不在 ‘ 黄道 ’ ‘ 黑道 ’ ， 总以 事理 为 要 ， 不及 面辞 了 。 ” ’ ”,"' The monk says that Mr Jia set out for the capital at five o'clock this morning , sir . He says he left a message to pass on to you . He said to tell you , "" A scholar should not concern himself with almanacs , but should act as the situation demands , "" and he said there was not time to say good-bye . '"
… 士隐 听 了 ， 也 只得 罢了 。,So Shi-yin was obliged to let the matter drop .
真是 闲处 光阴 易 过 ， 倏忽 又 是 元宵 佳节 。 士隐 令 家人 霍启 抱 了 英莲 去 看 社火 花灯 ， 半夜 中 ， 霍启 因要 小解 ， 便 将 英莲 放在 一家 门槛 上 坐 着 ， 待 他 小解 完 了 来 抱 时 ， 那 有 英莲 的 踪影 ？,"It is a true saying that ' time in idleness is quickly spent ' . In no time at all it was Fifteenth Night , and Shi-yin sent little Ying-lian out , in the charge of one of the servants called Calamity , to see the mummers and the coloured lanterns . It was near midnight when Calamity , feeling an urgent need to relieve his bladder , put Ying-lian down on someone 's doorstep while he went about his business , only to find , on his return , that the child was nowhere to be seen ."
急 的 霍启直 寻 了 半夜 ， 至 天明 不见 ， 那霍启 也 不敢 回来 见 主人 ， 便 逃往 他 乡 去 了 。,"Frantically he searched for her throughout the rest of the night ; but when day dawned and he had still not found her , he took to his heels , not daring to face his master and mistress , and made off for another part of the country ."
那士隐 夫妇 见 女儿 一夜 不 归 ， 便 知 有些 不好 ， 再 使 几 人 去 找寻 ， 回来 皆 云 影响 全 无 。,Shi-yin and his wife knew that something must be wrong when their little girl failed to return home all night . Then a search was made ; but all those sent out were obliged in the end to report that no trace of her could be found .
夫妻 二人 半世 只生 此 女 ， 一旦 失去 ， 何等 烦恼 ， 因此 昼夜 啼哭 ， 几乎 不顾 性命 。 看看 一月 ， 士隐 已先 得病 ， 夫人 封氏 也 因 思女构 疾 ， 日日 请 医问 卦 。,"The shock of so sudden a loss to a middle-aged couple who had only ever had the one daughter can be imagined . In tears every day and most of the night , they almost lost the will to go on living , and after about a month like this first Shi-yin and then his wife fell ill , so that doctors and diviners were in daily attendance on them ."
不想 这日 三月 十五 ， 葫芦 庙 中 炸供 ， 那 和尚 不 小心 ， 油锅 火逸 ， 便 烧着 窗纸 ：,"Then , on the fifteenth of the third month , while frying cakes for an offering , the monk of Bottle-gourd Temple carelessly allowed the oil to catch alight , which set fire to the paper window ."
此方 人家 俱用 竹篱 木壁 ， — — 也 是 劫数 应当 如此 ， — — 于是 接二连三 ， 牵五挂四 ， 将 一条街 烧 得 如 “ 火焰山 ” 一般 ；,"And , since the houses in this area all had wooden walls and bamboo fences - though also , doubtless , because they were doomed to destruction anyway - the fire leaped from house to house until the whole street was blazing away like a regular Fiery Mountain ;"
彼时 虽 有 军民 来救 ， 那 火 已成 了势 了 ， 如何 救得 下 ， 直烧 了 一夜 方息 ， 也 不知 烧 了 多少 人家 。,"and though the firemen came to put it out , by the time they arrived the fire was well under way and long past controlling , and roared away all night long until it had burnt itself out , rendering heaven knows how many families homeless in the process ."
只 可怜 甄家 在 隔壁 ， 早 成 了 一堆 瓦砾 场 了 ， — — 只有 他 夫妇 并 几个 家人 的 性命 不曾 伤 了 ， 急 的士 隐 惟 跌足 长叹 而已 。,"Poor Zhens ! Though they and their handful of domestics escaped unhurt , their house , which was only next door to the temple , was soon reduced to a heap of rubble , while Shi-yin stood by helpless , groaning and stamping in despair ."
与 妻子 商议 且 到 田庄 上去 住 ， 偏值 近年 水旱 不 收 ， 贼 盗 蜂起 ， 官兵 剿捕 ， 田庄 上 又 难以 安身 ， 只得 将 田地 都 折变 了 ， 携 了 妻子 与 两个 丫鬟 ， 投 他 岳丈 家 去 。,"After some discussion with his wife , Shi-yin decided that they should move to their farm in the country ; but a series of crop failures due to flooding and drought had led to widespread brigandage in those parts , and government troops were out everywhere hunting down the mutinous peasants and making arrests . In such conditions it was impossible to settle on the farm , so Shi-yin sold the land and , taking only two of the maids with them , went with his wife to seek refuge with his father-in-law , Feng Su."
他 岳丈 名唤 封肃 ， 本 贯大 如州 人氏 ， 虽 是 务农 ， 家中 却 还 殷实 ， 今 见 女婿 这 等 狼狈 而 来 ， 心中 便 有些 不 乐 ， 幸而 士隐 还有 折变 田产 的 银子 在 身边 ， 拿 出来 托 他 随便 置买 些 房地 ， 以为 后 日 衣食 之 计 ；,"This Feng Su was a Ru-zhou man who , though only a farmer by calling , had a very comfortable sufficiency . He was somewhat displeased to see his son-in-law arriving like a refugee on his doorstep ; but fortunately Shi-yin had on him the money he had realized from the sale of the farm , and this he now entrusted to his father-in-law to buy for him , as and when he could , a house and land on which he could depend for his future livelihood ."
那 封肃 便 半 用 半 赚 的 ， 略 与 他些 薄田 破屋 。,"Feng Su embezzled about half of this sum and used the other half to provide him with a ruinous cottage and some fields of poor , thin soil ."
士隐 乃 读书 之 人 ， 不 惯 生理 稼穑 等 事 ， 勉强 支持 了 一二年 ， 越发 穷 了 。,"A scholar , with no experience of business or agricultural matters , Shi-yin now found himself poorer after a year or two of struggle than when he had started ."
封肃 见面 时 ， 便 说 些 现成 话儿 ， 且 人前人后 ， 又 怨 他 不会 过 、 只 一味 好吃懒做 。 士隐 知道 了 ， 心中 未免 悔恨 ， 再 兼 上年 惊唬 ， 急忿怨痛 ， 暮年 之 人 ， 那 禁得 贫病交攻 ， 竟 渐渐 的 露出 了 那 下世 的 光景 来 。,"Feng Su would treat him to a few pearls of rustic wisdom whenever they met , but behind his back would grumble to all and sundry about ' incompetents ' and ' people who liked their food but were too lazy to work for it , which caused Shi-yin great bitterness when it came to his ears . The anxieties and injustices which now beset him , coming on top of the shocks he had suffered a year or two previously , left a man of his years with little resistance to the joint onslaught of poverty and ill-health , and gradually he began to betray the unmistakable symptoms of a decline ."
可巧 这日 拄 了 拐 扎挣 到 街前 散散心 时 ， 忽 见 那边 来 了 一个 跛足 道人 ， 疯狂 落拓 ， 麻鞋 鹑衣 ， 口内 念 着 几句 言词 道 ：,"One day , wishing to take his mind off his troubles for a bit , he had dragged himself , stick in hand , to the main road , when it chanced that he suddenly caught sight of a Taoist with a limp - a crazy , erratic figure in hempen sandals and tattered clothes , who chanted the following words to himself as he advanced towards him :"
世人 都晓 神仙 好 ，,"' Men all know that salvation should be won ,"
惟有 功名 忘不了 ！,"But with ambition will not have done , have done ."
古今 将相 在 何方 ？,W here are the famous ones of days gone by ?
荒冢 一堆 草 没 了 。,"In grassv graves they lie now , every one ."
世人 都晓 神仙 好 ，,"Men all know that salvation should be won ,"
只有 金银 忘不了 ！,"But with their riches will not have done , have done ."
终朝 只 恨 聚无多 ，,Each day they grumble they have not made enough .
及 到 多时 眼闭 了 。,"When they are enough , it is goodnight everyone !"
世人 都晓 神仙 好 ，,"Men all know that salvation should be won ,"
只有 娇妻 忘不了 ！,But with their loving wives they will not have done .
君 生日 日 说 恩情 ，,The darlings every day protest their love :
君 死 又 随 人 去 了 。,"But once you are dead , they are off with another one ."
世人 都晓 神仙 好 ，,"Men all know that salvation should be won ,"
只有 儿孙 忘不了 ！,"But with their children will not have done , have done ."
痴心 父母 古来 多 ，,"Yot though of parents fond there is no lack ,"
孝顺 子孙 谁 见 了 ？,Of grateful children saw I ne ' er a one . '
士隐 听 了 ， 便 迎上来 道 ：,Shi-yin approached the Taoist and questioned him .
“ 你 满口 说 些 什么 ？,' What is all this you are saying ?
— — 只 听见 些 ‘ 好 了 ’ ‘ 好 了 ’ 。 ”,"All I can make out is a lot of "" won "" and "" done "" . '"
那道人 笑 道 ： “ 你 若果 听见 ‘ 好 了 ‘ 二 字 ， 还 算 你 明白 ： 可知 世上 万般 ， 好 便是 了 ， 了 便是 好 ； 若 不了 ， 便 不好 ； 若 要 好 ， 须 是 了 。,"' If you can make out "" won "" and "" done "" , ' replied the Taoist with a smile , ' you may be said to have understood ; for in all the affairs of this world what is won is done , and what is done is won ; for whoever has not yet done has not yet won , and in order to have won , one must first have done ."
— — 我 这 歌儿 便 叫 《 好 了 歌 》 。 ”,"I shall call my song the "" Won-Done Song "" . '"
士隐 本是 有 夙慧 的 ， 一 闻 此言 ， 心中 早已 悟彻 ， 因 笑 道 “ 且 住 ！,"Shi-yin had always been quick-witted , and on hearing these words a flash of understanding had illuminated his mind . He therefore smiled back at the Taoist : ' Wait a minute !"
待 我 将 你 这 《 好 了 歌 》 注解 出来 何如 ？ ”,"How would you like me to provide your "" Won-Done Song "" with a commentary ? '"
道人 笑 道 ： “ 你 就 请解 。 ” 士隐 乃 说道 ：,' Please do ! ' said the Taoist ; and Shi-yin proceeded as follows :
陋室 空堂 ，,' Mean hovels and abandoned halls
当年 笏 满 床 ；,Where courtiers once paid daily calls :
衰草 枯 杨 ，,Bleak haunts where weeds and willows scarcely thrive
曾 为 歌舞 场 。,Were once with mirth and revelry alive .
蛛丝 儿 结满 雕梁 ，,"Whilst cobwebs shroud the mansion 's gilded beams ,"
绿 纱 今 又 在 蓬 窗上 。,The cottage casement with choice muslin gleams .
说 甚么 脂 正浓 、 粉 正 香 ，,Would you of perfumed elegance recite ?
如何 两鬓 又 成 霜 ？,"Even as you speak , the raven locks turn white ."
昨日 黄土 陇 头 埋 白骨 ，,"Who yesterday her lord 's bones laid in clay ,"
今宵 红 绡 帐 底 卧 鸳鸯 。,On silken bridal-bed shall lie today .
金满 箱 ， 银满 箱 ，,Coffers with gold and silver filled :
转眼 乞丐 人 皆 谤 ；,"Now , in a trice , a tramp by all reviled ."
正 叹 他 人命 不 长 ，,"One at some other 's short life gives a sigh ,"
那 知 自己 归来 丧 ？,"Not knowing that he , too , goes home - to die !"
训 有方 ，,"The sheltered and well-educated lad ,"
保不定 日后 作 强梁 。,"In spite of all your care , may turn out bad ;"
择 膏粱 ，,"And the delicate , fastidious maid"
谁 承望 流落 在 烟花巷 ！,"End in a foul stews , plying a shameful trade ."
因 嫌 纱帽 小 ，,The judge whose hat is too small for his head
致使 锁枷 扛 ；,"Wears , in the end , a convict 's cangue instead ."
昨 怜 破 袄 寒 ，,"Who shivering once in rags bemoaned his fate ,"
今 嫌 紫 蟒长 ；,Today finds fault with scarlet robes of state .
乱烘烘 你 方 唱 罢 我 登场 ，,"In such commotion does the world 's theatre rage : As each one leaves , another takes the stage ."
,In vain we roam :
反认 他 乡 是 故乡 ；,Each in the end must call a strange land home .
甚 荒唐 ，,
到头来 都 是 为 他人 作嫁衣裳 。,Each of us with that poor girl may compare Who sews a wedding-gown for another bride to wear . '
那 疯 跛 道人 听 了 ， 拍掌 大笑 道 ： “ 解得 切 ！ 解得 切 ！ ”,"' A very accurate commentary ! ' cried the mad , lame Taoist , clapping his hands delightedly ."
士隐 便 说 一声 “ 走 罢 ” ， 将 道人 肩上 的 搭 褪 抢过来 背上 ， 竟不 回家 ， 同着 疯 道人 飘飘 而 去 。,"But Shi-yin merely snatched the satchel that hung from the other 's shoulder and slung it from his own , and with a shout of ' Let's go ! ' and without even waiting to call back home , he strode off into the wide world in the company of the madman ."
当下 哄动 街坊 ， 众人 当作 一件 新闻 传说 。,"This event made a great uproar in the little town , and news of it was relayed from gossip to gossip until it reached the ears of Mrs Zhen , who cried herself into fits when she heard it ."
封氏闻 知 此信 ， 哭 个 死去活来 ， 只得 与 父亲 商议 ， 遣 人 各处 访寻 。 那 讨 音信 ？,"After consulting her father , she sent men out to inquire everywhere after her husband ; but no news of him was to be had ."
无奈何 ， 只得 依靠 着 他 父母 度日 ；,It was now imperative that she should move in with her parents and look to them for support .
幸而 身边 还有 两个 旧日 的 丫鬟 伏侍 ， 主仆 三 人 ， 日夜 作 些 针线 ， 帮 着 父亲 用度 。,"Fortunately she still had the two maids who had stayed on with her from the Soochow days , and by sewing and embroidering morning , noon and night , she and her women were able to make some contribution to her father 's income ."
那 封肃 虽然 每日 抱怨 ， 也 无可奈何 了 。,"The latter still found daily occasion to complain , but there was very little he could do about it ."
这日 那 甄家 的 大 丫鬟 在 门前 买线 ， 忽 听 得 街上 喝道 之 声 ， 众人 都 说 ： “ 新 太爷 到任 了 ！ ”,One day the elder of the two maids was purchasing some silks at the door when she heard the criers clearing the street and all the people began to tell each other that the new mandarin had arrived .
丫鬟 隐在 门内 看 时 ， 只见 军牢 快手 ， 一对一 对 过去 ， 俄 而 大 轿 内 抬 着 一个 乌帽 猩袍 的 官府 来 了 。 那 丫鬟 倒发 了 个 怔 ， 自 思 ： “ 这 官儿 好 面善 ， 倒象 在 那里 见 过 的 。 ”,"She hid in the doorway and watched the guards and runners marching past two by two . But when the mandarin in his black hat and scarlet robe of office was borne past in his great chair , she stared for some time as though puzzled . ' Where have I seen that mandarin before ? ' she wondered . ' His face looks extraordinarily familiar ."
于是 进入 房中 ， 也 就 丢 过 ， 不在 心上 。,But presently she went into the house again and gave the matter no further thought .
至 晚间 正 待 歇息 之 时 ， 忽 听 一片 声 打 的 门响 ， 许多 人 乱 嚷 ， 说 ： “ 本 县太爷 的 差人 来 传人 问话 ！ ” 封肃 听 了 ， 唬得 目瞪口呆 。,"That night , just as they were getting ready for bed , there was suddenly a great commotion at the door and a confused hubbub of voices shouting that someone was wanted at the yamen for questioning , which so terrified Feng Su that he was momentarily struck dumb and could only stare ."
不知 有何 祸事 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"If you wish to know what further calamity this portended , you will have to read the following chapter ."
第二回,Chapter 2
贾夫人 仙逝 扬州 城,A daughter of the Jias ends her days in Yangchow city
冷子兴 演说 荣国府,And Leng Zi-xing discourses on the Jias of Rong-guo House
却说 封肃 听见 公差 传唤 ， 忙 出来 陪笑 启问 ， 那些 人 只 嚷 ： “ 快 请 出 甄爷 来 ！ ”,"Hearing the clamour of yamen runners outside , Feng Su hurried to the door , his face wreathed in smiles , to ask what they wanted . ' Tell Mr Zhen to step outside , ' they were shouting . ' Hurry !"
封肃 忙 陪笑 道 ： “ 小人 姓 封 ， 并 不 姓 甄 ， 只有 当日 小婿 姓 甄 ， 今 已 出家 一二年 了 。,"Feng Su 's smile became even more ingratiating . ' My name is Feng , not Zhen . My son-in-law 's name is Zhen , but he left home to become a Taoist more than a year ago ."
不知 可是 问 他 ？ ”,Could he be the one you want ? '
那些 公人 道 ： “ 我们 也 不知 什么 ‘ 真 ’ ‘ 假 ’ ， 既是 你 的 女婿 ， 就 带 了 你 去 面禀 太爷 便 了 。 ”,"' "" Feng "" or "" Zhen "" , it is all the same to us , said the runners ; but if you are his father-in-law you would better come along with us to see the magistrate . '"
大家 把 封肃 推拥 而 去 ， 封家各各 惊慌 ， 不知 何事 。,"And they hustled him off , leaving the entire household in a state of panic , quite at a loss to know what the trouble could be ."
至 二 更 时分 ， 封肃 方 回来 ， 众人 忙 问 端的 。,"It was ten o'clock before Feng Su returned , and everyone pressed him to give a full account of what had transpired ."
— — “ 原来 新任 太爷 姓 贾名化 ， 本 湖州 人氏 ， 曾 与 女婿 旧交 ， 因 在 我家 门首 看见 娇杏 丫头 买线 ， 只 说 女婿 移住 此间 ， 所以 来 传 。,' It seems that the new mandarin is a Hu-zhou man called Jia . He used to be an acquaintance of Shi-yin 's in the old days . He guessed that Shi-yin must have moved to these parts when he saw our Lucky in the doorway buying silks . That is why he sent the runners here .
我 将 缘故 回明 ， 那 太爷 感伤 叹息 了 一回 ， 又 问 外孙女儿 ， 我 说 看 灯 丢 了 。,"I explained what had happened to Shi-yin , and he seemed very upset . Then he asked me about Ying-lian , and I said she was lost while out watching the lanterns ."
太爷 说 ： ‘ 不妨 ， 待 我 差 人 去 ， 务必 找寻 回来 。 ’,""" Never mind , "" he said , "" wait till I send some people out to look for her . We shall have her back in no time . """
说 了 一回 话 ， 临走 又 送 我 二两 银子 。 ”,"Then we chatted a bit longer , and just as I was going , he gave me two taels of silver . '"
甄家娘子 听 了 ， 不觉 感伤 。,Mrs Zhen could not help being affected by this account .
一夜 无 话 。,But the rest of that night we pass over in silence .
次日 早 有 雨 村 遣 人 送 了 两封 银子 、 四匹 锦缎 ， 答谢 甄家娘子 。,Early next day a messenger arrived from Yu-cun bearing two packets of silver and four bolts of silk brocade for Mrs Zhen as a token of the sender 's gratitude .
又 一封 密书 与 封肃 ， 托 他 向 甄家娘子 要 那娇杏 作 二房 。,There was also a confidential letter for Feng Su commissioning him to ask Mrs Zhen for Lucky 's hand as Yu-cun is second wife .
封肃 喜 得 眉开眼笑 ， 巴不得 去 奉承 太爷 ， 便 在 女儿 前 一力 撺掇 ， 当夜 用 一 乘 小 轿 便 把 娇杏 送进 衙内 去 了 。,"Enraptured at the prospect of doing a good turn for a mandarin , Feng Su hastened to urge upon his daughter the importance of complying with this request , and that very night Lucky was bundled into a small covered chair and carried off to the yamen ."
雨村 欢喜 ， 自 不必 言 ； 又 封 百金 赠与 封肃 ， 又 送 甄家娘子 许多 礼物 ， 令 其且 自 过活 ， 以待 访寻 女儿 下落 。,"Yu-cun 's delight goes without saying . Another hundred taels of silver were despatched to Feng Su , together with a number of good things for Mrs Zhen , to cheer and sustain her until such time as her daughter 's whereabouts could be discovered ."
却说 娇杏 那丫头 ， 便是 当年 回顾 雨村 的 ， 因 偶然 一 看 ， 便 弄 出 这段 奇缘 ， 也 是 意想不到 之 事 。,"Lucky was , of course , the maid who had once turned back to look at Yu-cun when they were living at the house in Soochow . She could scarcely have foreseen at the time what singular good fortune that one glance would procure for her ."
谁知 他 命运 两济 ， 不 承望 自到 雨村 身边 ， 只 一年 ， 便 生一子 ； 又 半载 ， 雨村 嫡配 忽 染疾 下世 ， 雨村 便 将 他 扶作 正室 夫人 ， 正是,"But she was destined to be doubly fortunate . She had not been with Yu-cun more than a year when she gave birth to a son ; and a mere six months later Yu-cun 's first wife died , whereupon Lucky was promoted to fill her place and became Her Ladyship . As the proverb says ,"
偶因 一 回顾 ，,Sometimes by chance A look or a glance
便 为 人 上 人 。,May one 's fortune advance .
原来 雨村 因 那年 士隐 赠 银 之后 ， 他 于 十六日 便 起身 赴京 ， 大 比 之期 ， 十分 得意 ， 中 了 进士 ， 选入 外班 ， 今 已 升 了 本 县太爷 。,"When Yu-cun received the gift of money from Zhen Shi-yin he had left for the capital on the day after the festival . He had done well in the Triennial examination , passing out as a Palace Graduate , and had been selected for external service . And now he had been promoted to the magistracy of this district ."
虽 才干 优长 ， 末 免 贪酷 ； 且 恃 才 侮上 ， 那同寅 皆 侧目而视 ， 不 上一年 ， 便 被 上司 参了 一本 ， 说 他 貌似 有 才 、 性实 狡猾 ； 又题 了 一两件 狥庇蠹 役 、 交结 乡绅 之 事 。,"But although his intelligence and ability were outstanding , these qualities were unfortunately offset by a certain cupidity and harshness and a tendency to use his intelligence in order to outwit his superiors ; all of which caused his fellow-officials to cast envious glances in his direction , with the result that in less than a year an unfavourable report was sent in by a senior official stating that his ' seeming ability was no more than a mask for cunning and duplicity ' and citing one or two instances in which he had aided and abetted the peculations of his underlings or allied himself with powerful local interests in order to frustrate the course of justice ."
龙 颜大怒 ， 即 命 革职 。,"The imperial eye , lighting on this report , kindled with wrath . Yu-cun 's instant dismissal was commanded ."
部文 一 到 ， 本府 各 官 无不 喜悦 。,"The officials at the Prefecture , when notice that he was to be cashiered arrived from the Ministry , rejoiced to a man ."
那 雨村 虽 十分 惭恨 ， 面上 却 全 无 一点 怨色 ， 仍 是 嘻笑 自若 ， 交代 过 了 公事 ， 将 历年 所积 的 宦囊 ， 并 家属 人 等 ， 送 至 原籍 安顿 妥当 了 ， 却 自己 担 风袖 月 ， 游览 天下 胜迹 。,"But Yu-cun , in spite of all the shame and chagrin that he felt , allowed no glimmer of resentment to appear on his face . Indeed , he joked and smiled as before , and when the business of handing over was completed , he took his wife and family and the loot he had accumulated during his years of office and having settled them all safely in his native Hu-zhou , set off , free as the air , on an extended tour of some of the more celebrated places of scenic interest in our mighty empire ."
那日 偶 又 游至 维扬 地方 ， 闻得今 年 盐政 点 的 是 林如海 。,One day Yu-cun chanced to be staying in the Yangchow area when he heard that the Salt Commissioner for that year was a certain Lin Ru-hai .
这 林如海 姓林 名海 ， 表字 如海 ， 乃是 前科 的 探花 ， 今 已 升 兰台寺 大夫 ， 本 贯 姑苏 人氏 ， 今 钦点 为 巡盐 御史 ， 到任 未久 。,"This Lin Ru-hai had passed out Florilege , or third in the whole list of successful candidates , in a previous Triennial , and had lately been promoted to the Censorate . He was a Soochow man and had not long taken up his duties in Yangchow following his nomination by the emperor as Visiting Inspector in that area ."
原来 这 林如海 之 祖 ， 也 曾 袭 过 列侯 的 ， 今 到 如 海 ， 业经 五世 ；,Lin Ru-hai came of an aristocratic family and was himself fifth in line since his ancestor 's ennoblement .
起初 只 袭 三世 ， 因 当今 隆恩 盛德 ， 额外 加恩 ， 至 如海 之 父 ， 又 袭 了 一代 ；,"The original patent had been inheritable only up to the third generation , and it was only through the magnanimity of the reigning sovereign that an exceptional act of grace had extended it for a further generation in the case of Lin Ruhai 's father ."
到 了 如 海 ， 便 从 科第 出身 ：,Lin Ru-hai himself had therefore been obliged to make his way up through the examination system .
虽 系世禄 之家 ， 却是 书香 之族 。,"It was fortunate for him that , though the family had up to his time enjoyed hereditary emoluments , it had nevertheless enjoined a high standard of education on all of its members ."
只 可惜 这 林家 支庶 不盛 ， 人丁 有限 ， 虽 有 几门 ， 却 与 如 海 俱 是 堂族 ， 没 甚 亲 支 嫡派 的 。,"Lin Ru-hai was less fortunate , however , in belonging to a family whose numbers were dwindling . He could still point to several related households , but they were all on the distaff side . There was not a single relation in the direct line who bore his name ."
今 如海 年 已 五十 ， 只有 一个三岁 之 子 ， 又 于 去岁 亡 了 ， 虽有 几房 姬 妾 ， 奈 命中 无子 ， 亦 无可如何 之 事 。,"Already he was fifty , and his only son had died the year before at the age of three . And although he kept several concubines , he seemed fated to have no son , and had all but resigned himself to this melancholy fact ."
只 嫡妻 贾氏 生 得 一 女 ， 乳名 黛玉 ， 年 方 五岁 ， 夫妻 爱之 如 掌上明珠 ；,"His chief wife , who had been a Miss Jia , had given him a daughter called Dai-yu ."
见 他 生 得 聪明 俊秀 ， 也 欲 使 他 识 几个 字 ， 不过 假充 养子 ， 聊解 膝下 荒凉 之 叹 。,"Both parents doted on her , and because she showed exceptional intelligence , conceived the idea of giving her a rudimentary education as a substitute for bringing up a son , hoping in this way somewhat to alleviate the sense of desolation left by the death of their only heir ."
且说 贾雨村 在 旅店 偶感 风寒 ， 愈后 又 因 盘费 不继 ， 正 欲 得 一个 居停 之所 ， 以为 息肩 之 地 ， 偶遇 两个 旧友 ， 认得 新 盐政 ， 知 他 正要 请 一 西席 教训 女儿 ， 遂 将 雨 村 荐 进 衙门 去 。,"Now Jia Yu-cun had had the misfortune to catch a severe chill while staying in his lodgings at Yangchow , and after his recovery , found himself somewhat short of cash . He was therefore already looking around for some more permanent haven where he could rest and recuperate , when he chanced to run into two old friends who were acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner and who , knowing that the latter was looking for a suitable tutor for his daughter , took Yu-cun along to the yamen and introduced him , with the result that he was given the job ."
这 女 学生 年纪 幼小 ， 身体 又 弱 ， 工课 不 限 多寡 ， 其余 不过 两个 伴读 丫鬟 ， 故雨 村 十分 省力 ， 正好 养病 。,"Since Yu-cun 's pupil was both very young and rather delicate , there were no regular hours of instruction ; and as she had only a couple of little maids studying with her for company who stayed away when she did , Yu-cun 's employment was far from arduous and left ample time for convalescence ."
看看 又 是 一载 有余 ， 不料 女 学生 之 母贾氏 夫人 一病而亡 ， 女 学生 奉侍 汤药 ， 守丧 尽 礼 ， 过于 哀痛 ， 素本 怯弱 ， 因此 旧病复发 ， 有 好些 时 不曾 上学 。,"A year or more passed uneventfully and then , quite unexpectedly , Lin Ru-hai 's wife took ill and died . Yu-cun 's little pupil helped with the nursing throughout her mother 's last illness and mourned for her bitterly after her death . The extra strain this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a recurrent sickness , and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons ."
雨村 闲居 无聊 ， 每当 风日 晴和 ， 饭后 便 出来 闲步 。,"Bored by his enforced idleness , Yu-cun took to going for walks as soon as lunch was over whenever the weather was warm and sunny ."
这 一日 偶至 郊外 ， 意欲 赏鉴 那 村野 风光 。 信步 至 一 山环水 漩 、 茂林修竹 之 处 ， 隐隐 有 座 庙宇 ， 门巷 倾颓 ， 墙垣 剥落 ， 有 额题 曰 “ 智通 寺 ” ， 门旁 又 有 一副 旧 破 的 对联 云 ：,"One day a desire to savour country sights and sounds led him outside the city walls , and as he walked along with no fixed destination in mind , he presently found himself in a place ringed with hills and full of murmuring brooks and tall stands of bamboo where a temple stood half-hidden among the trees . The walled approach to the gateway had fallen in and parts of the surrounding wall were in ruins . A board above the gate announced the temple 's name : THE TEMPLE OF PERFECT KNOWLEDGE while two cracked and worn uprights at the sides of the gate were inscribed with the following couplet :"
,( on the right-hand side )
身后 有余 忘 缩手 ，,"As long as there is a sufficiency behind you , you press greedily forward ."
,( on the left-hand side )
眼前 无路想 回头,It is only when there is no road in front of you that you think of turning back .
雨村 看 了 ， 因 想道 ： “ 这 两句 文 虽 甚 浅 ， 其意 则 深 ， 也 曾 游 过 些 名山 大刹 ， 倒 不曾 见 过 这话 头 ， 其中 想必 有个 翻过 筋斗 来 的 ， 也 未可知 ， 何不 进去 一 访 ？ ”,"' The wording is commonplace to a degree , ' Yu-cun reflected , ' yet the sentiment is quite profound . In all the famous temples and monasteries I have visited , I can not recollect having ever seen anything quite like it . I should not be surprised to find that some story of spectacular downfall and dramatic conversion lay behind this inscription . It might be worth going in and inquiring . '"
走入 看 时 ， 只有 一个 龙钟 老僧 在 那里 煮粥 ， 雨村 见 了 ， 却 不在意 ， 及至 问 他 两句话 ， 那老僧 既聋且昏 ， 又 齿 落 舌 钝 ， 所 答非所问 。,"But when he went inside and looked around , he saw only an ancient , wizened monk cooking some gruel who paid no attention whatsoever to his greetings and who proved , when Yu-cun went up to him and asked him a few questions , to be both deaf and partially blind . His toothless replies were all but unintelligible , and in any case bore no relation to the questions ."
雨村 不耐烦 ， 仍 退出 来 ， 意欲 到 那村 肆 中沽 饮 三杯 ， 以助 野趣 ， 于是 移 步行 来 。,Yu-cun walked out again in disgust . He now thought that in order to give the full rural flavour to his outing he would treat himself to a few cups of wine in a little country inn and accordingly directed his steps towards the near-by village .
刚 入 肆门 ， 只见 座 上 吃酒 之 客 ， 有 一 人 起身 大笑 ， 接 了 出来 ， 口内 说 ： “ 奇遇 ， 奇遇 ！ ”,He had scarcely set toot inside the door of the village inn when one of the men drinking at separate tables inside rose up and advanced to meet him with a broad smile . ' Fancy meeting you ! '
雨村 忙 看 时 ， 此人 是 都 中 古董 行 中 贸易 姓 冷 号子 兴 的 ， 旧日 在 都 相识 。,It was an antique dealer called Leng Zi-xing whom Yu-cun had got to know some years previously when he was staying in the capital .
— — 雨村 最 赞 这 冷子兴 是 个 有 作为 大 本领 的 人 ， 这子兴 又 借 雨 村 斯文 之 名 ， 故 二人 最相 投契 。 — — 雨村 忙 亦 笑 问 ： “ 老兄 何日 到 此 ？,"Yu-cun had a great admiration for Zixing as a practical man of business , whilst Zi-xing for his part was tickled to claim acquaintanceship with a man of Yu-cun 's great learning and culture . On the basis of this mutual admiration the two of them had got on wonderfully well , and Yu-cun now returned the other 's greeting with a pleased smile . ' My dear fellow !"
弟 竟 不知 。,How long have you been here ? I really had no idea you were in these parts .
今日 偶遇 ， 真 奇缘 也 ！ ”,It was quite an accident that I came here today at all . What an extraordinary coincidence ! '
子兴道 ： “ 去年 岁底 到 家 ， 今 因 还要 人 都 ， 从此 顺路 找 个 敝友 说 一句 话 ， 承 他 的 情 ， 留 我 多 住 两日 ， 我 也 无 甚 紧 事 ， 且 盘桓 两日 ， 待 月半时 ， 也 就 起身 了 。,"' I went home at the end of last year to spend New Year with the family , ' said Zi-xing . ' On my way back to the capital I thought I would stop off and have a few words with a friend of mine who lives hereabouts , and he very kindly invited me to spend a few days with him . I had not got any urgent business waiting for me , so I thought I might as well stay on a bit and leave at the middle of the month ."
今日 敝友 有事 ， 我 因 闲 走 到 此 ， 不期 这样 巧遇 ！ ”,I came out here on my own because my friend has an engagement today . I certainly did not expect to run into you here . '
一面 说 ， 一面 让 雨村 同席 坐 了 ， 另 整上 酒肴 来 ， 二人 闲谈 慢 饮 ， 叙 些 别 后 之 事 。,"Zi-xing conducted Yu-cun to his table as he spoke and ordered more wine and some fresh dishes to be brought . The two men then proceeded , between leisurely sips of wine , to relate what each had been doing in the years that had elapsed since their last meeting ."
雨村 因 问 ： “ 近日 都 中 可有 新闻 没有 ？ ”,Presently Yu-cun asked Zi-xing if anything of interest had happened recently in the capital .
子兴道 ： “ 倒 没有 什么 新闻 ， 倒 是 老先生 的 贵 同宗 家 出 了 一件 小小的 异事 。 ”,"' I can not think of anything particularly deserving of mention , said Zi-xing . ' Except , perhaps , for a very small but very unusual event that took place in your own clan there . '"
雨村 笑 道 ： “ 弟族 中 无人 在 都 ， 何 谈及 此 ？ ”,"' What makes you say that ? ' said Yu-cun , ' I have no family connections in the capital . '"
子兴笑 道 ： “ 你们 同姓 — — 岂非 一 族 ？ ”,"' Well , it is the same name , ' said Zi-xing . ' They must be the same clan . '"
雨村 问 是 谁家 ， 子兴笑 道 ： “ 荣国 贾府中 ， 可 也 不 玷辱 老先生 的 门楣 了 ！ ”,Yu-cun asked him what family he could be referring to . ' I fancy you would not disown the Jias of the Rong-guo mansion as unworthy of you . '
雨村 道 ： “ 原来 是 他家 。,"' Oh , you mean them , ' said Yu-cun ."
若论 起来 ， 寒族 人丁 却自 不少 ， 东汉 贾复 以来 ， 支派 繁盛 ， 各省 皆 有 ， 谁 能 逐细 考查 ， 若论 荣国 一支 ， 却是 同谱 ， 但 他 那 等 荣耀 ， 我们 不便 去 认 他 ， 故 越发 生疏 了 。 ”,"' There are so many members of my clan , its hard to keep up with them all . Since the time of Jia Fu of the Eastern Han dynasty there have been branches of the Jia clan in every province of the empire . The Rong-guo branch is , as a matter of fact , on the same clan register as my own ; but since they are exalted so far above us socially , we do not normally claim the connection , and nowadays we are completely out of touch with them . '"
子 兴叹 道 ： “ 老先生 休 这样 说 。,"Zi-xing sighed . ' You should not speak about them in that way , you know ."
如今 的 这 荣宁 两府 也 都 萧索 了 ， 不 比 先时 的 光景 。 ”,Nowadays both the Rong and Ning mansions are in a greatly reduced state compared with what they used to be . '
雨村 道 ： “ 当日 宁荣 两宅 ， 人口 也 极多 ， 如何 便 萧索 了 呢 ？ ”,' When I was last that way the Rong and Ning mansions both seemed to be fairly humming with life . Surely nothing could have happened to reduce their prosperity in so short a time ? '
子兴道 ： “ 正是 ， 说来 也 话 长 。 ”,"' Ah , you may well ask . But it is a long story . '"
雨村 道 ： “ 去岁 我 到 金陵 时 ， 因欲 游览 六朝 遗迹 ， 那日 进 了 石头城 ， 从 他 宅 门前 经过 ， 街东 是 宁国府 ， 街西 是 荣国府 ， 二宅 相连 ， 竟将 大半条 街 占 了 。,"' Last time I was in Jinling , ' went on Yu-cun , ' I passed by their two houses one day on my way to Shi-tou-cheng to visit the ruins . The Ning-guo mansion along the eastern half of the road and the Rong-guo mansion along the western half must between them have occupied the greater part of the north side frontage of that street ."
大 门外 虽 冷落 无人 ， 隔 着 围墙 一 望 ， 里面 厅 殿 楼阁 ， 也 还 都 峥嵘 轩峻 ， 就是 后边 一带 花园里 ， 树木 山石 ， 也 都 还有 葱 蔚洇润 之 气 ， 那里 象 个 衰败 之 家 ？ ”,"It is true that there was not much activity outside the main entrances , but looking up over the outer walls I had a glimpse of the most magnificent and imposing halls and pavilions , and even the rocks and trees of the gardens beyond seemed to have a sleekness and luxuriance that were certainly not suggestive of a family whose fortunes were in a state of decline . '"
子兴笑 道 ： “ 亏 你 是 进士 出身 ， — — 原来 不通 ！,"' Well ! For a Palace Graduate Second Class , you ought to know better than that !"
古人 有 言 ： ‘ 百足之虫 ， 死而不僵 ’ ， 如今 虽说 不 似先 年 那样 兴盛 ， 较之 平常 仕宦 人家 ， 到底 气象 不同 。,"Haven ' t you ever heard the old saying , "" The beast with a hundred legs is a long time dying "" ? Although I say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past , of course I do not mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average government official ."
如今 人口 日 多 ， 事务 日盛 ， 主仆 上下 ， 都 是 安富尊荣 ， 运筹 谋画 的 竟 无 一个 。,"At the moment the numbers of their establishment and the activities they engage in are , if anything , on the increase . Both masters and servants all lead lives of luxury and magnificence ."
那日 用 排场 ， 又 不能 将 就 省俭 ， 如今 外面 的 架子 虽 没 很 倒 ， 内囊 却 也 尽 上来 了 。,"And they still have plenty of plans and projects under way But they can not bring themselves to economize or make any adjustment in their accustomed style of living . Consequently , though outwardly they still manage to keep up appearances , inwardly they are beginning to feel the pinch ."
— — 这 也 是 小事 。,But that is a small matter .
更 有 一件 大事 ： 谁知 这样 钟鸣鼎食 的 人家 儿 ， 如今 养 的 儿孙 ， 竟 一代 不如 一代 了 ！ ”,"There is something much more seriously wrong with them than that . They are not able to turn out good sons , those stately houses , tor all their pomp and show The males in the family get more degenerate from one generation to the next . '"
雨村 听说 ， 也 道 ： “ 这样 诗礼之家 ， 岂 有 不善 教育 之 理 ？,"' Surely , said Yu-cun with surprise , ' it is inconceivable that such highly cultured households should not give their children the best education possible ?"
别门 不知 ， 只说 这 宁荣 两宅 ， 是 最 教子有方 的 ， 何至 如此 ？ ”,"I say nothing of other families , but the Jias of the Ning and Rong households used to be famous for the way in which they brought up their sons . How could they come to be as you describe ? '"
子 兴叹 道 ： “ 正说 的 是 这 两门 呢 ！,"' I assure you , it is precisely those families I am speaking of Let me tell you something of their history ."
等 我 告诉 你 ： 当日 宁国 公是 一母 同胞 弟兄 两个 。,The Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo were two brothers by the same mother .
宁公 居长 ， 生 了 两个 儿子 。,Ning-guo was the elder of the two .
宁公 死 后 ， 长子 贾代化 袭 了 官 ， 也 养 了 两个 儿子 ：,"When he died , his eldest son , Jia Dai-hua , inherited his post . Daihua had two sons ."
长子 名 贾敷 ， 八九岁 上死 了 ， 只 剩 了 一个 次子 贾敬 ， 袭 了 官 ， 如今 一味 好 道 ， 只 爱 烧 丹炼 汞 ， 别事 一概 不管 。,"The elder , Jia Fu , died at the age of eight or nine , leaving only the second son , Jia Jing , to inherit . Nowadays Jia Jing 's only interest in life is Taoism . He spends all his time over retorts and crucibles concocting elixirs , and refuses to be bothered with anything else ."
幸而 早年 留下 一个 儿子 ， 名唤 贾珍 ， 因 他 父亲 一 心想 作 神仙 ， 把 官倒 让 他 袭 了 。,"' Fortunately he had already provided himself with a son , Jia Zhen , long before he took up this hobby . So , having set his mind on turning himself into an immortal , he has given up his post in favour of this son ."
他 父亲 又 不肯 住 在 家里 ， 只 在 都 中 城外 和 那些 道士 们 胡 羼 。,And what is more he refuses outright to live at home and spends his time fooling around with a pack of Taoists somewhere outside the city walls .
这位 珍爷 也 生 了 一个 儿子 ， 今年 才 十六岁 ， 名叫 贾蓉 。,"' This Jia Zhen has got a son of his own , a lad called Jia Rong , just turned sixteen ."
如今 敬 老爷 不管 事 了 ， 这 珍爷 那里 干 正事 ？ 只 一味 高乐 不了 ， 把 那 宁国府 竟 翻过来 了 ， 也 没有 敢 来 管 他 的 人 。,"With old Jia Jing out of the way and refusing to exercise any authority , Jia Zhen has thrown his responsibilities to the winds and given himself up to a life of pleasure . He has turned that Ning-guo mansion upside down , but there is no one around who dares gainsay him ."
再说 荣府 你 听 — — 方才 所说 异事 就 出 在 这里 ：,' Now I come to the Rong household - it was there that this strange event occurred that I was telling you about .
自 荣公 死 后 ， 长子 贾 代善 袭 了 官 ， 娶 的 是 金陵 世家 史侯 的 小姐 为 妻 ， 生 了 两个 儿子 ： 长 名 贾 赦 ， 次 名 贾政 ， 如今 代善 早已 去世 ， 太夫人 尚 在 ， 长子 贾 赦袭 了 官 ， 为 人 却 也 中平 ， 也 不 管理 家事 。,"When the old Duke of Rong-guo died , his eldest son , Jia Daishan , inherited his emoluments . He married a girl from a very old Nanking family , the daughter of Marquis Shi , who bore him two sons , Jia She and Jia Zheng . ' Dai-shan has been dead this many a year , but the old lady is still alive . The elder son , Jia She , inherited ; but he is only a very middling sort of person and does not play much part in running the family ."
惟有 次子 贾政 ， 自幼 酷喜 读书 ， 为 人 端方 正直 ， 祖父 钟爱 ， 原 要 他 从 科甲 出身 ， 不料 代善 临终 遗本 一上 ， 皇上 怜念 先臣 ， 即 叫 长子 袭 了 官 ， 又 问 还有 几个 儿子 ， 立刻 引见 ， 又 将 这 政 老爷 赐 了 个 额外主事 职衔 ， 叫 他 入 部习学 ； 如今 现已 升 了 员外郎 。,"The second son , though , Jia Zheng , has been mad keen on study ever since he was a lad . He is a very upright sort of person , straight as a die . He was his grandfather 's favourite . He would have sat for the examinations , but when the emperor saw Dai-shan 's testamentary memorial that he wrote on his death bed , he was so moved , thinking what a faithful servant the old man had been , that he not only ordered the elder son to inherit his father 's position , but also gave instructions that any other sons of his were to be presented to him at once , and on seeing Jia Zheng he gave him the post of Supernumerary Executive Officer , brevet rank , with instructions to continue his studies while on the Ministry 's payroll . From there he has now risen to the post of Under Secretary ."
这 政 老爷 的 夫人 王氏 ， 头 胎生 的 公子 名叫 贾珠 ， 十四岁 进 学 ， 后来 娶 了 妻 ， 生 了 子 ， 不到 二十岁 ， 一 病 就 死 了 ， 第二 胎生 了 一位 小姐 ， 生 在 大年初一 ， 就 奇 了 ；,"' Sir Zheng is lady was formerly a Miss Wang . Her first child was a boy called Jia Zhu . He was already a Licensed Scholar at the age of fourteen . Then he married and had a son . But he died of an illness before he was twenty . The second child she bore him was a little girl , rather remarkable because she was born on New Year 's day ."
不想 隔 了 十几年 ， 又 生 了 一位 公子 ， 说来 更 奇 ：,Then after an interval of twelve years or more she suddenly had another son .
一 落 胞胎 ， 嘴里 便 衔 下 一块 五彩 晶莹 的 玉 来 ， 还有 许多 字迹 ；,"He was even more remarkable , because at the moment of his birth he had a piece of beautiful , clear , coloured jade in his mouth with a lot of writing on it ."
,They gave him the name ' Bao-yu ' as a consequence .
你 道 是 新闻 不是 ？ ”,Now tell me if you do not think that is an extraordinary thing . '
雨村 笑 道 ： “ 果然 奇异 ！,"' It certainly is , ' Yu-cun agreed ."
只怕 这人 的 来历 不小 ！ ”,' I should not be at all surprised to find that there was something very unusual in the heredity of that child .
子兴 冷笑 道 ： “ 万 人 都 这样 说 ， 因而 他 祖母 爱如珍宝 。,"' Humph , ' said Zi-xing . A great many people have said that . That is the reason why his old grandmother thinks him such a treasure ."
那 周岁 时 ， 政 老爷 试 他 将来 的 志向 ， 便 将 世上 所有 的 东西 ， 摆 了 无数 叫 他 抓 ， 谁知 他 一概 不取 ， 伸手 只 把 些 脂粉 钗 环 抓来 玩弄 ， 那 政 老爷 便 不 喜欢 ， 说 将来 不过 酒色之徒 ， 因此 不 甚 爱惜 。,"But when they celebrated the First Twelvemonth and Sir Zheng tested his disposition by putting a lot of objects in front of him and seeing which he would take hold of , he stretched out his little hand and started playing with some women is things - combs , bracelets , pots of rouge and powder and the like - completely ignoring all the other objects . Sir Zheng was very displeased . He said he would grow up to be a rake , and ever since then he hasn ' t felt much affection for the child ."
独 那 太君 还是 命根子 一般 。,But to the old lady he is the very apple of her eye .
— — 说来 又 奇 ： 如今 长 了 十来 岁 ， 虽然 淘气 异常 ， 但 聪明 乖觉 ， 百个 不及 他 一个 ， 说起 孩子 话 来 也 奇 ：,"' But there is more that is unusual about him than that . He is now rising ten and unusually mischievous , yet his mind is as sharp as a needle . You would not find one in a hundred to match him . Some of the childish things he says are most extraordinary ."
他 说 ： ‘ 女儿 是 水 做 的 骨肉 ， 男子 是 泥 做 的 骨肉 ， 我 见 了 女儿 便 清爽 ， 见 了 男子 便 觉 浊 臭 逼人 ！ ’,"He will say , "" Girls are made of water and boys are made of mud . When I am with girls I feel fresh and clean , but when I am with boys I feel stupid and nasty . """
你 道 好笑 不好 笑 ？,Now is not that priceless !
将来 色鬼 无疑 了 ！ ”,"He will be a ladykiller when he grows up , no question of that . '"
雨村 罕然 厉色 道 ： “ 非 也 ！,Yu-cun 's face assumed an expression of unwonted severity . ' Not so . By no means .
可惜 你们 不 知道 这人 的 来历 ， — — 大约 政 老前辈 也 错以淫魔 色鬼 看待 了 ！,It is a pity that none of you seem to understand this child 's heredity . Most likely even my esteemed kinsman Sir Jia Zheng is mistaken in treating the boy as a future libertine .
若非 多 读书 识事 ， 加以 致知 格物 之 功 、 悟道 参 玄之 力者 ， 不能 知 也 。 ”,"This is something that no one but a widely read person , and one moreover well-versed in moral philosophy and in the subtle arcana of metaphysical science could possibly understand . '"
子兴 见 他 说 得 这样 重大 ， 忙 请教 其 故 。,"Observing the weighty tone in which these words were uttered , Zi-xing hurriedly asked to be instructed , and Yu-cun proceeded as follows :"
雨村 道 ： “ 天地生 人 ， 除大仁 大恶 ， 余者 皆 无 大异 ， 若大 仁者 则 应运而生 ， 大 恶者 则 应劫 而 生 ， 运生 世治 ， 劫生世危 。,"' The generative processes operating in the universe provide the great majority of mankind with natures in which good and evil are commingled in more or less equal proportions . Instances of exceptional goodness and exceptional badness are produced by the operation of beneficent or noxious ethereal influences , of which the former are symptomatized by the equilibrium of society and the latter by its disequilibrium ."
尧 、 舜 、 禹 、 汤 、 文 、 武 、 周 、 召 、 孔 、 孟 、 董 、 韩 、 周 、 程 、 朱 、 张 ， 皆 应运而生 者 ；,"' Thus , Yao , Shun , Yu , Tang , King Wen , King Wu , the Duke of Zhou , the Duke of Shao , Confucius , Mencius , Dong Zhong-shu , Han Yu , Zhou Dun-yi , the Cheng brothers , Zhu Xi and Zhang Zai - all instances of exceptional goodness - were born under the influence of benign forces , and all sought to promote the well-being of the societies in which they lived ;"
蚩尤 、 共工 、 桀 、 纣 、 始皇 、 王莽 、 曹操 、 桓温 、 安禄山 、 秦桧 等 ， 皆 应劫 而 生者 ：,"whilst Chi You , Gong Gong , Jie , Zhou , the First Qin Emperor , Wang Mang , Cao Cao , Huan Wen , An Lu-shan and Qin Hui - all instances of exceptional badness - were born under the influence of harmful forces , and all sought to disrupt the societies in which they lived ."
大 仁者 修治 天下 ， 大 恶者 扰乱 天下 。,"' Now , the good cosmic fluid with which the natures of the exceptionally good are compounded is a pure , quintessential humour ; whilst the evil fluid which infuses the natures of the exceptionally bad is a cruel , perverse humour ."
清明 灵秀 ， 天地 之 正气 ， 仁者 之 所 秉 也 ， 残忍 乖僻 ， 天地 之 邪气 ， 恶者 之 所 秉 也 。,"' Therefore , our age being one in which beneficent ethereal influences are in the ascendant , in which the reigning dynasty is well-established and society both peaceful and prosperous , innumerable instances are to be found , from the palace down to the humblest cottage , of individuals endowed with the pure , quintessential humour ."
今 当 祚 永运隆 之 日 ， 太平 无为 之 世 ， 清明 灵秀 之 气 所 秉者 ， 上 自 朝廷 ， 下 至 草野 ， 比比皆是 。,"' Moreover , an unused surplus of this pure , quintessential humour , unable to find corporeal lodgement , circulates freely abroad until it manifests itself in the form of sweet dews and balmy winds , asperged and effused for the enrichment and refreshment of all terrestial life . ' Consequently , the cruel and perverse humours , unable to circulate freely in the air and sunlight , subside , by a process of incrassation and coagulation , into the bottoms of ditches and ravines ."
所余 之 秀气 ， 漫无 所归 ， 遂 为 甘露 ， 为 和 风 ， 洽然 溉 及 四海 ， 彼 残忍 乖 邪 之 气 ， 不能 荡 溢于 光天化日 之下 ， 遂 凝结 充塞 于 深沟 大壑 之中 ， 偶因 风荡 ， 或 被 云 摧 ， 略有 摇动 感发 之 急 ， 一丝 半缕 ， 悮 而 逸 出 者 ， 值 灵秀 之 气 适过 ， 正 不容 邪 ， 邪 复妒 正 ， 两 不 相下 ， 如 风水 雷电 ， 地中 既 遇 ， 既 不能 消 ， 又 不能 让 ， 必致 搏击 掀发 ， 既然 发泄 ， 那 邪气 亦必赋 之 于 人 ， 假使 或 男 或 女 ， 偶 秉 此 气 而 生者 ， 上 则 不能 为 仁人 为 君子 ， 下 亦 不能 为 大 凶大 恶 ：,"' Now , should these incrassate humours chance to be stirred or provoked by wind or weather into a somewhat more volatile and active condition , it sometimes happens that a stray wisp or errant flocculus may escape from the fissure or concavity in which they are contained ; and if some of the pure , quintessential humour should chance to be passing overhead at that same moment , the two will become locked in irreconcilable conflict , the good refusing to yield to the evil the evil persisting in its hatred of the good . And just as wind , water , thunder and lightning meeting together over the earth can neither dissipate nor yield one to another but produce an explosive shock resulting in the downward emission of rain , so does this clash of humours result in the forcible downward expulsion of the evil humour , which , being thus forced downwards , will find its way into some human creature . ' Such human recipients , whether they be male or female , since they are already amply endowed with the benign humour before the evil humour is injected , are incapable of becoming either greatly good or greatly bad ;"
置 之 千万 人 之中 ， 其 聪俊 灵秀 之 气 ， 则 在 千 万人之上 ， 其 乖僻邪谬 不近人情 之 态 ， 又 在 千万 人 之下 ；,"but place them in the company of ten thousand others and you will find that they are superior to all the rest in sharpness and intelligence and inferior to all the rest in perversity , wrongheadedness and eccentricity ."
若 生于 公侯 富贵 之 家 ， 则 为 情 痴情 种 ；,Born into a rich or noble household they are likely to become great lovers or the occasion of great love in others ;
若 生于 诗书 清贫 之族 ， 则 为 逸士 高 人 ；,in a poor but well-educated household they will become literary rebels or eccentric aesthetes ;
纵然 生于 薄祚 寒门 ， 甚至 为 奇 优 ， 为名 娼 ， 亦 断 不至 为 走卒 健 仆 ， 甘 遭 庸夫 驱制 ，,"even if they are born in the lowest stratum of society they are likely to become great actors or famous hetaerae . Under no circumstances will you find them in servile or menial positions , content to be at the beck and call of mediocrities ."

此 皆 易地 则 同 之人 也 。 ”,"All of these , though their circumstances differed , were essentially the same . '"
子兴道 ： “ 依 你 说 ， ‘ 成则 公侯 败则 贼 ’ 了 ？ ”,"' You mean ' Zi-xing interposed , ' Zhang victorious is a hero , Zhang beaten is a lousy knave ? '"
雨村 道 ： “ 正是 这 意 。,"' Precisely so , ' said Yu-cun ."
你 还 不知 ， 我 自 革职 以来 ， 这 两年 遍游 各省 ， 也 曾 遇见 两个 异样 孩子 ， 所以 方才 你 一说 这 宝玉 ， 我 就 猜 着 了 八九 也 是 这 一派 人物 。,' I should have told you that during the two years after I was cashiered I travelled extensively in every province of the empire and saw quite a few remarkable children in the course of my travels ; so that just now when you mentioned this Bao-yu I felt pretty certain what type of boy he must be .
不用 远 说 ， 只 这 金陵 城内 ， 钦差 金陵 省体 仁院 总裁 甄家 ， 你 可 知道 ？ ”,But one does not need to go very far afield for another example . There is one in the Zhen family in Nanking - I am refer-ring to the family of the Zhen who is Imperial Deputy Director-General of the Nanking Secretariat . Perhaps you know who I mean ? '
子兴道 ： “ 谁 人不知 ！,' Who does not ? ' said Zi-xing .
这 甄府 就是 贾府 老亲 ， 他们 两家 来往 极 亲热 的 ， — — 就是 我 也 和 他家 往来 非 止 一日 了 。,"' There is an old family connection between the Zhen family and the Jias of whom we have just been speaking , and they are still on very close terms with each other . I have done business with them myself for longer than I would care to mention . '"
雨村 笑 道 ： “ 去岁 我 在 金陵 ， 也 曾 有人 荐 我 到 甄府 处 馆 ， 我 进去 看 其 光景 ， 谁知 他家 那 等 荣贵 ， 却是 个 ‘ 富而好礼 ’ 之 家 ， 倒 是 个 难得 之馆 。,"' Last year when I was in Nanking , ' said Yu-cun , smiling at the recollection , ' T was recommended for the post of tutor in their household . I could tell at a glance , as soon as I got inside the place , that for all the ducal splendour this was a family ' though rich yet given to courtesy ' , in the words of the Sage , and that it was a rare piece of luck to have got a place in it ."
但是 这个 学生 虽 是 启蒙 ， 却 比 一个 举业 的 还 劳神 。,"But when I came to teach my pupil , though he was only at the first year primary stage , he gave me more trouble than an examination candidate ."
说 起来 更 可笑 ：,' He was indeed a comedy .
他 说 ： ‘ 必 得 两个 女儿 陪 着 我 读书 ， 我方 能 认得 字 ， 心上 也 明白 ； 不然 ， 我 心里 自己 糊涂 。 ’,"He once said , "" I must have two girls to do my lessons with me if I am to remember the words and understand the sense . Otherwise my mind will simply not work . """
又 常 对着 跟 他 的 小厮 们 说 ： ‘ 这 “ 女儿 ” 两个 字 极 尊贵 极 清净 的 ， 比 那 瑞兽 珍禽 、 奇花异草 更觉 希罕 尊贵 呢 ！,"And he would often tell the little pages who waited on him , "" The word ' girl is very precious and very pure . It is much more rare and precious than all the rarest beasts and birds and plants in the world ."
你们 这种 浊 口臭 舌 ， 万万不可 唐突 了 这 两个 字 ， 要紧 ， 要紧 ！,"So it is most extremely important that you should never , never violate it with your coarse mouths and stinking breath ."
但凡 要说 的 时节 ， 必用 净水 香茶 漱 了 口 方可 ； 设若 失错 ， 便 要 凿 牙 穿 眼 的 。 ’,"Whenever you need to say it , you should first rinse your mouths out with clean water and scented tea . And if ever I catch you slipping up , I shall have holes drilled through your teeth and lace them up together . """
其 暴虐 顽劣 ， 种种 异常 ；,' There was simply no end to his violence and unruliness .
只 放 了 学 进去 ， 见 了 那些 女儿 们 ， 其 温厚 和平 ； 聪敏 文雅 ， 竟变 了 一个 样子 。,"Yet as soon as his lessons were over and he went inside to visit the girls of the family , he became a completely different person - all gentleness and calm , and as intelligent and well-bred as you please ."
因此 他 令尊 也 曾 下死 笞 楚 过 几次 ， 竟 不能 改 ；,' His father gave him several severe beatings but it made no difference .
每 打 的 吃疼 不过 时 ， 他 便 ‘ 姐姐 ’ ‘ 妹妹 ’ 的 乱叫 起来 。,"Whenever the pain became too much for him he would start yelling "" Girls ! girls ! """
后来 听 得 里面 女儿 们 拿 他 取笑 ： ‘ 因 何 打 急 了 只管 叫 姐妹 作 什么 ？,"Afterwards , when the girls in the family got to hear about it , they made fun of him . "" Why do you always call to us when you are hurt ?"
莫不 叫 姐妹 们 去 讨情 讨饶 ？,I suppose you think we shall come and plead for you to be let off .
你 岂 不愧 些 ！ ’,"You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! """
他 回答 的 最妙 ， 他 说 ： ‘ 急痛 之 时 ， 只 叫 “ 姐姐 ” “ 妹妹 ” 字样 ， 或 可解 疼 ， 也 未可知 ， 因 叫 了 一声 ， 果觉 疼 得 好些 ， 遂 得 了 秘法 ， 每 疼痛 之 极 ， 便 连叫 姐妹 起来 了 ！ ’,"But you should have heard his answer . He said , "" Once when the pain was very bad , I thought that perhaps if I shouted the word ' girls ' it might help to ease it . Well , "" he said , "" I just called out once , and the pain really was quite a bit better . So now that I have found this secret remedy , I just keep on shouting ' Girls ! girls ! girls ! ' whenever the pain is at its worst . """
你 说 可笑 不可 笑 ？,I could not help laughing .
为 他 祖母 溺爱 不明 ， 每 因 孙 辱 师 责子 ， 我 所以 辞 了 馆 出来 的 。 这 等 子弟 必 不能 守 祖父 基业 、 从 师友 规劝 的 。,"' But because his grandmother doted on him so much , she was always taking the child 's part against me and his father . In the end I had to hand in my notice . A boy like that will never be able to keep up the family traditions or listen to the advice of his teachers and friends ."
— — 只 可惜 他家 几个 好姊妹 都 是 少有 的 ！ ”,"The pity of it is , though , that the girls in that family are all exceptionally good . '"
子兴道 ： “ 便是 贾府中 现在 三个 也 不错 。,"' The three at present in the Jia household are also very fine girls , ' said Zi-xing ."
政 老爷 的 长女 名 元春 ， 因 贤孝 才 德 ， 选入 宫作 女史 去 了 。,"' Sir Jia Zheng 's eldest girl , Yuan-chun , was chosen for her exceptional virtue and cleverness to be a Lady Secretary in the Imperial Palace ."
二 小姐 乃是 赦 老爷 姨娘 所 出 ， 名 迎春 。,The next in age after her and eldest of the three still at home is called Ying-chun . She is the daughter of Sir Jia She by one of his secondary wives .
三 小姐 政 老爷 庶出 ， 名 探春 。,"After her comes another daughter of Sir Zheng 's , also a concubine 's child , called Tan-chun ."
四 小姐 乃 宁府珍 爷 的 胞妹 ， 名惜 春 ， 因史 老夫 人 极 爱 孙女 ， 都 跟 在 祖母 这边 ， 一处 读书 ， 听 得 个个 不错 。 ”,"The youngest , Xi-chun , is sister-german to Mr Jia Zhen of the Ning-guo mansion . Old Lady Jia is very fond of her granddaughters and keeps them all in her own apartments on the Rong-guo side . They all study together , and I have been told that they are doing very well . '"
雨村 道 ： “ 更妙 在 甄家 风俗 ， 女儿 之 名 ， 亦 皆 从 男子 之 名 ， 不 似 别人 家里 ， 另外 用 这些 ‘ 春 ’ ‘ 红 ’ ‘ 香 ’ ‘ 玉 ’ 等 艳 字 ；,"' One of the things I liked about the Zhen family , ' said Yu-cun , was their custom of giving the girls the same sort of names as the boys , unlike the majority of families who invariably use fancy words like ' chun ' , ' hong ' , ' riang ' , ' yu ' , and so forth ."
何 得 贾府 亦 落 此 俗套 ？ ”,How comes it that the Jias should have followed the vulgar practice in this respect ? '
子兴道 ： “ 不然 。,"' They did not , ' said Zi-xing ."
只 因 现今 大 小姐 是 正月初一 所 生 ， 故名 ‘ 元春 ’ ， 余者 都 从 了 ‘ 春 ’ 字 ；,"' The eldest girl was called "" Yuan-chun "" because she was in fact born on the first day of spring . The others were given names with "" chun "" in them to match hers ."
上 一排 的 却 也 是从 弟兄 而来 的 。,"But if you go back a generation , you will find that among the Jias too the girls had names exactly like the boys ' ."
— — 现有 对证 ： 目今 你 贵 东家 林公 的 夫人 ， 即 荣府 中 赦政 二公 的 胞妹 ， 在家 时 名字 唤 贾敏 ， 不信 时 你 回去 细访 可知 。 ”,"' I can give you proof . Your present employer 's good lady is sister-german to Sir She and Sir Zheng of the Rong household . Her name , before she married , was Jia Min . If you do not believe me , you make a few inquiries when you get home and you will find it is so . '"
雨村 拍手 笑 道 ： “ 是 极 ！,Yu-cun clapped his hands with a laugh . ' Of course !
我 这 女 学生 名叫 黛玉 ， 他 读书 凡 ‘ 敏 ’ 字 他 皆 念作 ‘ 密 ’ 字 ， 写字 遇 着 ‘ 敏 ’ 字 亦 减 一二 笔 ， 我 心中 每每 疑惑 ， 今 听 你 说 ， 是 为此 无疑 矣 。,"I have often wondered why it is that my pupil Dai-yu always pronounces "" min "" as "" mi "" when she is reading and , if she has to write it , always makes the character with one or two strokes missing . Now I understand ."
怪 道 我 这 女 学生 言语 举止 另是 一样 ， 不 与 凡 女子 相同 ， 度 其 母 不凡 ， 故生 此 女 ；,No wonder her speech and behaviour are so unlike those of ordinary children ! I always supposed that there must have been something remarkable about the mother for her to have produced so remarkable a daughter .
今 知为 荣府 之外 孙 ， 又 不足 罕 矣 。,"Now I know that she was related to the Jias of the Rong household , I am not surprised ."
— — 可惜 上月 其 母 竟 亡故 了 ！ ”,"' By the way , I am sorry to say that last month the mother passed away . '"
子 兴叹 道 ： “ 老 姊妹 三个 ， 这 是 极小 的 ， 又 没了 ！,Zi-xing sighed . ' Fancy her dying so soon ! She was the youngest of the three .
长 一辈 的 姊妹 一个 也 没了 ！,"And the generation before them are all gone , every one ."
只 看 这 小 一辈 的 将来 的 东床 何如 呢 。 ”,We shall have to see what sort of husbands they manage to find for the younger generation ! '
雨村 道 ： “ 正是 。,"' Yes , indeed , ' said Yu-cun ."
方才 说 政公 已有 一个 衔 玉之子 ， 又 有 长子 所 遗弱 孙 ， 这 赦老 竟 无 一个 不成 ？ ”,Just now you mentioned that Sir Zheng had this boy with the jade in his mouth and you also mentioned a little grandson left behind by his elder son . What about old Sir She ? Surely he must have a son ? '
子兴道 ： “ 政公 既有 玉儿 之后 ， 其 妾 又 生 了 一个 ， 倒 不知 其 好歹 。,"' Since Sir Zheng had the boy with the jade , he has had another son by a concubine , ' said Zi-xing , ' but I could not tell you what he is like ."
只 眼前 现有 二子 一 孙 ， 却 不知 将来 何如 。,"So at present he has two sons and one grandson . Of course , we do not know what the future may bring ."
若 问 那 赦 老爷 ， 也 有 一子 ， 名叫 贾琏 ， 今 已 二十多岁 了 ， 亲上做亲 ， 娶 的 是 政 老爷 夫人 王氏 内侄女 ， 今 已 娶 了 四五年 。,"' But you were asking about Sir She . Yes , he has a son too , called Jia Lian . He is already a young man in his early twenties . He married his own kin , the niece of his Uncle Zheng 's wife , Lady Wang . He is been married now for four or five years ."
这位 琏 爷 身上 ， 现 捐 了 个 同知 ， 也 是 不喜 正务 的 ；,Holds the rank of a Subprefect by purchase . He is another member of the family who does not find responsibilities congenial .
于 世 路上 好 机变 ， 言谈 去 得 ， 所以 目今 现在 乃 叔 政 老爷 家住 ， 帮 着 料理 家务 。,"He knows his way around , though , and has a great gift of the gab , so at present he stays at home with his Uncle Zheng and helps him manage the family 's affairs ."
谁知 自 娶 了 这位 奶奶 之后 ， 倒 上下 无人 不 称颂 他 的 夫人 ， 琏 爷 倒退 了一舍 之 地 ， — — 模样 又 极 标致 ， 言谈 又 爽利 ， 心机 又 极 深细 ， 竟是 个 男人 万 不及 一 的 ！ ”,"However , ever since he married this young lady I mentioned , everyone high and low has joined in praising hen and he has been put into the shade rather . She is not only a very handsome young woman , she also has a very ready tongue and a very good head - more than a match for most men , I can tell you . '"
雨村 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 可知 我言 不谬 了 ： 你 我 方才 所说 的 这 几个 人 ， 只怕 都 是 那 正邪 两 赋 而 来 ， 一路 之 人 ， 未可知 也 ！ ”,"' You see , I was not mistaken , ' said Yu-cun . ' All these people you and I have been talking about are probably examples of that mixture of good and evil humours I was describing to you . '"
子兴道 ： “ ‘ 正 ’ 也罢 ！ ‘ 邪 ’ 也罢 ！,"' Well , I do not know about that , ' said Zi-xing ."
只顾 算 别人 家 的 账 ， 你 也 吃 一 杯酒 才 好 。 ”,"' Instead of sitting here setting other people 's accounts to rights , let is have another drink !"
雨村 道 ： “ 只顾 说话 ， 就 多 吃 了 几杯 。,"' I am afraid I have drunk quite a lot while we were busy talking , ' said Yu-cun ."
子兴笑 道 ： “ 说 着 别人 家 的 闲话 ， 正好 下酒 ， 即 多 吃 几杯 何妨 ！ ”,Zi-xing laughed . ' There is nothing like a good gossip about other people 's affairs for making the wine go down ! I am sure an extra cup or two will not do us any harm . '
雨村 向 窗外 看道 ： “ 天 也 晚 了 ， 仔细 关了 城 ， 我们 慢慢 进城 再 谈 ， 未为不可 。 ”,Yu-cun glanced out of the window . ' It is getting late . We must be careful we do not get shut out of the city . Why not continue the conversation on our way back ? Then we can take our time . '
于是 二人 起身 ， 算 还 酒钱 。 方欲 走时 ， 忽 听 得 后面 有人 叫 道 ： “ 雨村 兄 恭喜 了 ！ 特来 报 个 喜信 的 。 ”,"The two men accordingly rose from their seats , settled the bill for the wine , and were just about to start on their way , when a voice from behind called out , ' Yu-cun , congratulations ! I have got some good news for you . '"
雨村 忙 回头 看 时 ， — — 要知 是 谁 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"Yu-cun turned to look . But if you wish to know who it was , you will have to read the next chapter ."
第三回,Chapter 3
托 内兄 如 海荐 西宾,Lin Ru-hai recommends a private tutor to his brother-in-law
接 外孙 贾母 惜 孤女,And old Lady Jia extends a compassionate welcome to the motherless child
却说 雨村 忙 回头 看 时 ， 不是 别人 ， 乃是 当日 同僚 一案 参革 的 张如圭 ；,"When Yu-cun turned to look , he was surprised to see that it was Zhang Ru-gui , a former colleague who had been cashiered at the same time and for the same reason as himself ."
他 系 此地 人 ， 革 后 家居 ， 今 打听 得 都 中 奏 准起 复旧 员 之 信 ， 他 便 四下里 寻情 找门路 ， 忽 遇见 雨村 ， 故忙 道喜 。,"Zhang Ru-gui was a native of these parts , and had been living at home since his dismissal . Having just wormed out the information that a motion put forward in the capital for the reinstatement of ex-officials had been approved , he had been dashing about ever since , pulling strings and soliciting help from potential backers , and was engaged in this activity when he unexpectedly ran into Yu-cun . Hence the tone of his greeting ."
二人 见 了 礼 ， 张如圭 便 将 此信 告知 雨村 ， 雨村 欢喜 ， 忙忙 叙 了 两句 ， 各自 别 去 回家 。,"As soon as they had finished bowing to each other , Zhang Ru-gui told Yu-cun the good news , and after further hurried conversation they went their separate ways ."
— — 冷子兴 听 得 此言 ， 便 忙 献计 ， 令 雨 村 央求 林如海 ， 转向 都 中 去 央 烦 贾政 。,"Leng Zi-xing , who had overheard the news , proposed a plan . Why should not Yu-cun ask his employer Lin Ru-hai to write to his brother-in-law Jia Zheng in the capital and enlist his support on his , Yu-cun 's , behalf ?"
雨村 领 其意 而 别 。,"Yu-cun agreed to follow this suggestion , and presently the two friends separated ."
回至 馆 中 ， 忙 寻 邸 报 看 真确 了 ， 次日 面谋之如海 。,"Back in his quarters , Yu-cun quickly hunted out a copy of the Gazette , and having satisfied himself that the news was authentic , broached the matter next day with Lin Ru-hai ."
如 海道 ： “ 天缘 凑巧 ： 因 贱 荆 去世 ， 都 中家 岳母 念及 小女 无人 依傍 ， 前 已 遣 了 男女 船只 来 接 ， 因 小女 未曾 大 痊 ， 故 尚未 行 ， 此刻 正思 送 女 进京 。,"' It so happens that an opportunity of helping you has just presented itself , said Ru-hai . ' Since my poor wife passed on , my mother-in-law in the capital has been worried about the little girl having no one to look after her , and has already sent some of her folk here by barge to fetch her away . The only reason she has so far not gone is that she has not been quite recovered from her illness . I was , however , only just now thinking that the moment to send her had arrived ."
因 向 蒙 教训 之 恩 ， 未经 酬报 ， 遇 此 机会 ， 岂 有 不 尽心 图报 之 理 ， 弟 已 预筹 之 ， 修 下荐 书 一封 ， 托 内兄 务为 周全 ， 方可 稍 尽 弟 之 鄙诚 ；,"And as I have still done nothing to repay you for your kindness in tutoring her for me , you may be sure that now this opportunity has presented itself I shall do my very best to help you . ' As a matter of fact , I have already made a few arrangements . I have written this letter here entrusting my brother-in-law with your affair , explaining my indebtedness to you and urging him to see it properly settled ."
即 有所 费 ， 弟 于 内 家信 中 写明 ， 不劳 吾兄 多虑 。 ”,I have also made it quite clear in my letter that any expenses which may be involved are to be taken care of ; so you have nothing to worry about on that account . '
雨村 一面 打 恭 ， 谢不释口 ， 一面 又 问 ： “ 不知 令亲 大人 现居 何 职 ？,Yu-cun made an elaborate bow to his patron and thanked him profusely . He then ventured a question . ' I am afraid I do not know what your relation 's position is at the capital .
只怕 晚生 草率 ， 不敢 进谒 。 ”,Might it not be a little embarrassing for a person in my situation to thrust himself upon him ? '
如 海 笑 道 ： “ 若论 舍亲 ， 与 尊兄 犹系 一家 ， 乃 荣公之 孙 ：,Ru-hai laughed . ' You need have no anxiety on that score . My brothers-in-law in the capital are your own kinsmen . They are grandsons of the former Duke of Rong-guo .
大 内兄 现袭 一等 将军 之 职 ， 名赦 ， 字 恩 侯 。,"The elder one , Jia She , is an hereditary official of the First Rank and an honorary colonel ; the younger one , Jia Zheng , is an Under Secretary in the Ministry of Works ."
二 内兄 名政 ， 字存 周 ， 现任 工部 员外郎 ， 其 为 人 谦恭 厚道 ， 大 有 祖父 遗风 ， 非 膏粱 轻薄 之流 ， 故弟 致书 烦 托 。,"He takes very much after his late grandfather : a modest , generous man , quite without the arrogance of the pampered aristocrat . That is why I have addressed this letter to him ."
否则 不但 有 污尊 兄清 操 ， 即 弟 亦 不屑 为 矣 。 ”,"If I did not have complete confidence in his willingness to help you , I should not have put your honour at risk by soliciting him ; nor , for that matter , should I have taken the trouble to write the letter . '"
雨村 听 了 ， 心 下方 信 了 昨日 子兴 之 言 ， 于是 又 谢 了 林如海 。,Yu-cun now knew that what Zi-xing had told him was the truth and he thanked Lin Ru-hai once again .
如 海 又 说 ： “ 择 了 出 月初 二日 小 女人 都 ， 吾兄 即 同路 而 往 ， 岂 不 两 便 ？ ”,"' I have fixed the second day of next month for my little girl 's journey to the capital , ' said Ru-hai . If you cared to travel with her , it would be convenient for both of us . '"
雨村 唯唯 听命 ， 心中 十分 得意 。,"Yu-cun accepted the suggestion with eager deference . Everything , he thought to himself , was turning out very satisfactorily ."
如 海 遂 打点 礼物 并 饯行 之 事 ， 雨村 — 领 了 。,"Ru-hai for his part set about preparing presents for his wife 's family and parting gifts for Yu-cun , all of which Yu-cun in due course took charge of ."
那 女 学生 原 不忍 离亲 而 去 ， 无奈 他 外祖母 必欲其往 ， 且 兼如 海说 ：,"At first his little pupil could not be persuaded to part from her father ; but her grandmother was insistent that she should go , and Ru-hai added his own reasons ."
“ 汝父 年 已 半百 ， 再 无续 室 之 意 ， 且 汝 多 病 ， 年 又 极小 ， 上 无 亲母 教养 ， 下 无 姊妹 扶持 ：,"I am half a century old now , my dear , and I have no intention of taking a second wife ; so there will be no one here to act as a mother to you . It is not , either , as if you had sisters who could help to take care of you . You know how often you are poorly . And you are still very young ."
今去 依傍 外祖母 及 舅氏 姊妹 ， 正好 减 我 内顾之忧 ， 如何 不 去 ？ ”,It would be a great weight off my mind to know that you had your Grandmother Jia and your uncles ' girls to fall back on . I really think you ought to go . '
黛玉 听 了 ， 方 洒泪 拜别 ， 随了 奶娘 及 荣府 中 几个 老妇 登舟 而 去 。,After this Dai-yu could only take a tearful leave of her father and go down to the boat with her nurse and the old women from the Rong mansion who had been sent to fetch her .
雨村 另有 船只 ， 带 了 两个 小童 ， 依附 黛玉 而 行 。,"There was a separate boat for Yu-cun and a couple of servant-boys to wait on him , and he too now embarked in the capacity of Dai-yu 's escort ."
一日 到 了 京都 ， 雨村 先整 了 衣冠 ， 带 着 童仆 ， 拿 了 “ 宗侄 ” 的 名帖 ， 至 荣府 门上 投 了 。,"In due course they arrived in the capital , and Yu-cun , dressed in his best and with the two servant-boys at his heels , betook himself to the gate of the Rong mansion and handed in his visiting-card , on which he had been careful to prefix the word ' kinsman ' to his own name ."
彼时 贾政 已 看 了 妹丈 之 书 ， 即忙 请 人 相会 ， 见 雨 村 像貌 魁伟 ， 言谈 不俗 ， 且 这 贾政 最喜 的 是 读书人 ， 礼贤下士 ， 拯溺 救 危 ， 大有 祖风 ， — — 况 又 系妹 丈 致意 ， 因此 优待 雨村 ， 更 又 不同 ：,"By this time Jia Zheng had already seen his brother-in-law 's letter , and accorded him an interview without delay . Yu-cun 's imposing looks and cultivated speech made an excellent impression on Jia Zheng , who was in any case always well-disposed towards scholars , and preserved much of his grandfather 's affability with men of letters and readiness to help them in any sort of trouble or distress . And since his own inclinations were in this case reinforced by his brother-in-law 's strong recommendation , the treatment he extended to Yu-cun was exceptionally favourable ."
便 极力 帮助 ， 题奏 之 日 ， 谋 了 一个 复职 ， 不上 两 月 ， 便 选 了 金陵 应 天府 ， 辞 了 贾政 ， 择日 到任 去 了 ， 不在话下 。,"He exerted himself on his behalf to such good effect that on the very day his petition was presented Yu-cun 's reinstatement was approved , and before two months were out he was appointed to the magistracy of Ying-tian-fu in Nanking . Thither , having chosen a suitable day on which to commence his journey , and having first taken his leave of Jia Zheng , he now repaired to take up his duties . But of him , for the time being , no more ."
且说 黛玉 自 那日 弃 舟 登岸 时 ， 便 有 荣府 打发 轿子 并 拉 行李 车辆 伺候 。,"On the day of her arrival in the capital , Dai-yu stepped ashore to find covered chairs from the Rong mansion for her and her women and a cart for the luggage ready waiting on the quay ."
这 黛玉 常 听 得 母亲 说 ， 他 外祖母 家 与 别人 家 不同 ， 他 近日 所见 的 这 几个 三等 的 仆妇 ， 吃穿用度 ， 已 是 不凡 ， 何况 今 至 其家 ， 都 要 步步 留心 ， 时时 在意 ， 不要 多 说 一句 话 ， 不可 多行 一步 路 ， 恐 被 人 耻笑 了去 。,"She had often heard her mother say that her Grandmother Jia is home was not like other people 's houses . The servants she had been in contact with during the past few days were comparatively low-ranking ones in the domestic hierarchy , yet the food they ate , the clothes they wore , and everything about them was quite out of the ordinary . Dai-yu tried to imagine what the people who employed these superior beings must be like . When she arrived at their house she would have to watch every step she took and weigh every word she said , for if she put a foot wrong they would surely laugh her to scorn ."
自 上 了 轿 ， 进 了 城 ， 从 纱窗 中 瞧 了 一 瞧 ， 其 街市 之 繁华 ， 人烟 之阜盛 ， 自非 别处 可比 。,"Dai-yu got into her chair and was soon carried through the city walls . Peeping through the gauze panel which served as a window , she could see streets and buildings more rich and elegant and throngs of people more lively and numerous than she had ever seen in her life before ."
又 行 了 半日 ， 忽见 街北 蹲 着 两个 大 石狮子 ， 三间 兽头 大门 ， 门 前列 坐 着 十来个 华冠丽服 之 人 ， 正门 不 开 ， 只 东西 两 角门 有人 出入 ；,"After being carried for what seemed a very great length of time , she saw , on the north front of the east-west street through which they were passing , two great stone lions crouched one on each side of a triple gateway whose doors were embellished with animal-heads . In front of the gateway ten or so splendidly dressed flunkeys sat in a row . The centre of the three gates was closed , but people were going in and out of the two side ones ."
正门 之上 有 一 匾 ， 匾 上 大书 “ 敕 造 宁国府 ” 五个 大字 。,There was a board above the centre gate on which were written in large characters the words : NING-GUO HOUSE Founded and Constructed by Imperial Command
黛玉 想道 ： “ 这 是 外祖 的 长房 了 。 ”,Dai-yu realized that this must be where the elder branch of her grandmother 's family lived .
又 往 西 不远 ， 照样 也 是 三间 大门 ， 方是 “ 荣国府 ” ， — — 却 不 进 正门 ， 只 由 西 角门 而 进 。 轿子 抬 着 走 了 一 箭 之 远 ， 将 转弯 时 ， 便 歇 了 轿 ， 后面 的 婆子 也 都 下来 了 ， 另换 了 四个 眉目 秀洁 的 十七八岁 的 小厮 上来 抬 着 轿子 ， 众 婆子 步下 跟随 。 至 一 垂花门 前 落下 ， 那 小厮 俱 肃然 退出 ， 众 婆子 上前 打起 轿帘 ， 扶黛玉 下 了 轿 。,"The chair proceeded some distance more down the street and presently there was another triple gate , this time with the legend RONG-GUO HOUSE above it . Ignoring the central gate , her bearers went in by the western entrance and after traversing the distance of a bow-shot inside , half turned a corner and set the chair down . The chairs of her female attendants which were following behind were set down simultaneously and the old women got out . The places of Dai-yu 's bearers were taken by four handsome , fresh-faced pages of seventeen or eighteen . They shouldered her chair and , with the old women now following on foot , carried it as far as an ornamental inner gate . There they set it down again and then retired in respectful silence . The old women came forward to the front of the chair , held up the curtain , and helped Dai-yu to get out ."
黛玉 扶 着 婆子 的 手 进 了 垂花门 ： 两边 是 超手 游廊 ， 正中 是 穿堂 ， 当地 放 着 一个 紫檀 架子 大理石 屏风 。,"Each hand resting on the outstretched hand of an elderly attendant , Dai-yu passed through the ornamental gate into a courtyard which had balustraded loggias running along its sides and a covered passage-way through the centre . The foreground of the courtyard beyond was partially hidden by a screen of polished marble set in an elaborate red sandalwood frame ."
转过 屏风 ， 小小 三间 厅房 ， 厅 后 便是 正房 大院 。,"Passing round the screen and through a small reception hall beyond it , they entered the large courtyard of the mansion 's principal apartments ."
正面 五间 上房 ， 皆 是 雕梁画栋 ， 两边 穿 山 游廊 厢房 ， 挂 着 各色 鹦鹉 画眉 等 雀鸟 。,"These were housed in an imposing five-frame building resplendent with carved and painted beams and rafters which faced them across the courtyard . Running along either side of the courtyard were galleries hung with cages containing a variety of different-coloured parrots , cockatoos , white-eyes , and other birds ."
台阶 上 坐 着 几个 穿红着绿 的 丫头 ， — — 一 见 他们 来 了 ， 都 笑 迎上来 ， 道 ：,Some gaily-dressed maids were sitting on the steps of the main building opposite . At the appearance of the visitors they rose to their feet and came forward with smiling faces to welcome them .
“ 刚才 老太太 还 念诵 呢 ！,' You have come just at the right time !
可巧 就 来 了 。 ”,Lady Jia was only this moment asking about you . '
于是 三四 人 争 着 打 帘子 ， — — 一面 听 得 人 说 ： “ 林姑娘 来 了 ！ ”,"Three or four of them ran to lift up the door-curtain , while another of them announced in loud tones , ' Miss Lin is here ! '"
黛玉方 进房 ， 只见 两个 人 扶 着 一位 鬓发 如 银 的 老母 迎上来 ， 黛玉知 是 外祖母 了 ， 正 欲 下拜 ， 早 被 外祖母 抱住 ， 搂入 怀中 ， “ 心肝儿 肉 ” 叫 着 大哭 起来 ； 当下 侍立 之 人 ， 无不 下泪 ； 黛玉 也 哭 个 不休 。,"As Dai-yu entered the room she saw a silver-haired old lady advancing to meet her , supported on either side by a servant . She knew that this must be her Grandmother Jia and would have fallen on her knees and made her kotow , but before she could do so her grandmother had caught her in her arms and pressing her to her bosom with cries of ' My pet ! and ' My poor lambl burst into loud sobs , while all those present wept in sympathy , and Dai-yu felt herself crying as though she could never stop ."
众人 慢慢 解劝 ， 那黛玉 方 拜见 了 外祖母 。,It was some time before those present succeeded in calming them both down and Dai-yu was at last able to make her kotow .
贾母方 一一 指 与 黛玉 道 ：,Grandmother Jia now introduced those present .
“ 这 是 你 大 舅母 。,"' This is your elder uncle 's wife , Aunt Xing ."
— — 这 是 二舅母 。,"This is your Uncle Zheng 's wife , Aunt Wang ."
— — 这 是 你 先前 珠 大哥 的 媳妇 珠 大嫂子 。 ”,"This is Li Wan , the wife of your Cousin Zhu , who died . '"
黛玉 一一 拜见 。,Dai-yu kotowed to each of them in turn .
贾母 又 叫 ： “ 请 姑娘 们 。,' Call the girls ! ' said Grandmother Jia .
今日 远客 来 了 ， 可以 不必 上学 去 。 ”,' Tell them that we have a very special visitor and that they need not do their lessons today . '
众人 答应 了 一声 ， 便 去 了 两个 。,"There was a cry of ' Yes madam ' from the assembled maids , and two of them went off to do her bidding ."
不 一时 ， 只见 三个 奶妈 并 五六个 丫鬟 拥 着 三位 姑娘 来 了 ：,"Presently three girls arrived , attended by three nurses and five or six maids ."
第一个 肌肤 微 丰 ， 身材 合中 ， 腮 凝新 荔 ， 鼻腻 鹅脂 ， 温柔 沉默 ， 观 之 可亲 ；,"The first girl was of medium height and slightly plumpish , with cheeks as white and firm as a fresh lychee and a nose as white and shiny as soap made from the whitest goose-fat . She had a gentle , sweet , reserved manner . To look at her was to love her ."
第二个 削肩 细腰 ， 长挑 身材 ， 鸭蛋脸 儿 ， 俊 眼 修眉 ， 顾盼神飞 ， 文彩 精华 ， 见之忘欲 ， 第三个 身量 未 足 ， 形容 尚小 。,"The second girl was rather tall , with sloping shoulders and a slender waist . She had an oval face under whose well-formed brows large , expressive eyes shot out glances that sparkled with animation . To look at her was to forget all that was mean or vulgar . The third girl was undersized and her looks were still somewhat babyish and unformed ."
— — 其 钗 环 裙 袄 ， 三 人 皆 是 一样 的 妆束 。,All three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of bracelets and hair ornaments .
黛玉忙 起身 迎上来 见 礼 ， 互相 厮认 ；,Dai-yu rose to meet them and exchanged curtseys and introductions .
归 了 坐位 ， 丫鬟 送 上 茶 来 ， 不过 叙 些 黛玉 之 母 ， 如何 得病 ， 如何 请 医 服药 ， 如何 送死 发丧 。,"When she was seated once more , a maid served tea , and a conversation began on the subject of her mother : how her illness had started , what doctors had been called in , what medicines prescribed , what arrangements had been made for the funeral , and how the mourning had been observed ."
不免 贾母 又 伤感 起来 ， 因说 ： “ 我 这些 女孩儿 ， 所疼 的 独有 你 母亲 ， 今 一旦 先我而亡 ， 不得 见面 ， 怎 不 伤心 ！ ”,"This conversation had the foreseeable effect of upsetting the old lady all over again . ' Of all my girls your mother was the one I loved the best , ' she said , ' and now she is been the first to go , and without my even being able to see her again before the end . I can not help being upset ! '"
说 着 携 了 黛玉 的 手 又 哭 起来 ； 众人 都 忙 相 劝慰 ， 方 略略 止住 。,"And holding fast to Dai-yu 's hand , she once more burst into tears . The rest of the company did their best to comfort her , until at last she had more or less recovered ."
众人 见 黛玉 年纪 虽 小 ， 其 举止言谈 不俗 ， 身体 面貌 虽 弱不胜衣 ， 却 有 一段 风流 态度 ， 便 知 他 有 不足 之 症 ， 因 问 ： “ 常服 何药 ？ 为何 不 治好 了 ？ ”,"Everyone 's attention now centred on Dai-yu . They observed that although she was still young , her speech and manner already showed unusual refinement . They also noticed the frail body which seemed scarcely strong enough to bear the weight of its clothes , but which yet had an inexpressible grace about it , and realizing that she must be suffering from some deficiency , asked her what medicine she took for it and why it was still not better ."
黛玉 道 ： “ 我 自来 如此 ， 从 会 吃饭 时 便 吃药 ， 到 如今 了 ， 经过 多少 名医 ， 总未 见效 。,"' I have always been like this , ' said Dai-yu . ' I have been taking medicine ever since I could eat and been looked at by ever so many well-known doctors , but it has never done me any good ."
那 一年 我 才 三岁 ， 记得 来 了 一个 癞头 和尚 ， 说 要化 我 去 出家 ， 我 父母 自是 不 从 。,"Once , when I was only three , I can remember a scabby-headed old monk came and said he wanted to take me away and have me brought up as a nun ; but of course , Mother and Father would not hear of it ."
他 又 说 ： ‘ 既 舍不得 他 ， 但 只怕 他 的 病 一生 也 不能 好 的 ！,"So he said , "" Since you are not prepared to give her up , I am afraid her illness will never get better as long as she lives ."
— — 若 要 好 时 ， 除非 从此以后 总 不许 见 哭声 ， 除 父母 之外 ， 凡 有 外亲 ， 一概 不见 ， 方可 平安 了此一生 。 ’,"The only way it might get better would be if she were never to hear the sound of weeping from this day onwards and never to see any relations other than her own mother and father . Only in those conditions could she get through her life without trouble . """
这 和尚 疯疯癫癫 说 了 这些 不经之谈 ， 也 没 人理 他 。,"Of course , he was quite crazy , and no one took any notice of the things he said ."
如今 还是 吃 人参 养荣丸 。 ”,I am still taking Ginseng Tonic Pills '
贾母 道 ： “ 这 正好 ， 我 这里 正 配 丸药 呢 ， 叫 他们 多 配 一料 就是 了 。 ”,"' Well , that is handy , ' said Grandmother Jia . ' I take the Pills myself . We can easily tell them to make up a few more each time . '"
一 语 未 完 ， 只 听 后院 中 有 笑 语声 ， 说 ： “ 我 来 迟 了 ， 没 得 迎接 远客 ！ ”,"She had scarcely finished speaking when someone could be heard talking and laughing in a very loud voice in the inner courtyard behind them . ' Oh dear ! I am late , ' said the voice . ' I have missed the arrival of our guest . '"
黛玉 思忖 道 ： “ 这些 人 个个 皆 敛声屏气 如此 ， 这 来者 是 谁 ， 这样 放诞 无礼 ？ ”,"' Everyone else around here seems to go about with bated breath , ' thought Dai-yu . ' Who can this new arrival be who is so brash and unmannerly ? '"
心下 想 时 ， 只见 一群 媳妇 丫鬟 拥 着 一个 丽人 ， 从后 房 进来 ：,"Even as she wondered , a beautiful young woman entered from the room behind the one they were sitting in , surrounded by a bevy of serving women and maids ."
这个 人 打扮 与 姑娘 们 不同 ， 彩绣 辉煌 ， 恍若 神妃 仙子 ， 头上 戴 着 金丝 八宝 攒 珠 髻 ， 绾 着 朝阳 五凤 挂 珠 钗 ， 项上 戴 着 赤金 盘 螭 缨络 圈 ， 身上 穿着 缕 金百蝶 穿 花 大红 云 缎 窄 褃 袄 ， 外罩 五彩 刻丝 石青 银鼠 褂 ， 下 着 翡翠 撒花 洋绉 裙 ；,"She was dressed quite differently from the others present , gleaming like some fairy princess with sparkling jewels and gay embroideries . Her chignon was enclosed in a circlet of gold filigree and clustered pearls . It was fastened with a pin embellished with a flying phoenixes , from whose beaks pearls were suspended on tiny chains . Her necklet was of red gold in the form of a coiling dragon . Her dress had a fitted bodice and was made of dark red silk damask with a pattern of flowers and butterflies in raised gold thread . Her jacket was lined with ermine . It was of a slate-blue stuff with woven insets in coloured silks . Her under-skirt was of a turquoise-coloured imported silk crépe embroidered with flowers ."
一双 丹凤 三角 眼 ， 两 弯 柳叶 掉 梢 眉 ， 身量 苗条 ， 体格 风骚 ：,"She had , moreover , eyes like a painted phoenix , eyebrows like willow-leaves , a slender form , seductive grace ;"
粉面 含春威 不露 ，,the ever-smiling summer face of hidden thunders showed no trace ;
丹唇 未 启笑 先闻 。,the ever-bubbling laughter started almost before the lips were parted .
黛玉 连忙 起身 接见 ， 贾母笑 道 ： “ 你 不 认得 他 ： 他 是 我们 这里 有名 的 一个 泼辣 货 ， 南京 所谓 ‘ 辣子 ‘ ， 你 只 叫 他 ‘ 凤辣子 ’ 就是 了 。 ”,"' You do not know her , ' said Grandmother Jia merrily . ' She is a holy terror this one . What we used to call in Nanking a "" peppercorn "" . You just call her "" Peppercorn Feng "" . She will know who you mean ! '"
黛玉正 不知 以 何 称呼 ， 众 姊妹 都 忙 告诉 黛玉 道 ： “ 这 是 琏 二 嫂子 。 ” 黛玉 虽 不曾 识面 ， 听见 他 母亲 说 过 ： 大舅 贾 赦之子 贾琏 ， 娶 的 就是 二舅母 王氏 的 内侄女 ；,"Dai-yu was at a loss to know how she was to address this Peppercorn Feng until one of the cousins whispered that it was ' Cousin Lian 's wife ' , and she remembered having heard her mother say that her elder uncle , Uncle She , had a son called Jia Lian who was married to the niece of her Uncle Zheng 's wife , Lady Wang ."
自幼 假充 男儿 教养 ， 学名 叫做 王熙凤 。,"She had been brought up from earliest childhood just like a boy , and had acquired in the schoolroom the somewhat boyish-sounding name of Wang Xi-feng ."
黛玉忙 陪笑 见 礼 ， 以 “ 嫂 ” 呼之 。,"Dai-yu accordingly smiled and curtseyed , greeting her by her correct name as she did so ."
这 熙凤 携 着 黛玉 的 手 ， 上下 细细 打量 一回 ， 便 仍 送 至 贾母 身边 坐下 ， 因 笑 道 ：,Xi-feng took Dai-yu by the hand and for a few moments scrutinized her carefully from top to toe before conducting her back to her seat beside Grandmother Jia .
“ 天下 真 有 这样 标致 人儿 ！ 我 今日 才 算 看见 了 ！,"' She is a beauty , Grannie dear ! If I had not set eyes on her today , I should not have believed that such a beautiful creature could exist !"
况且 这 通身 的 气派 竟 不象 老祖宗 的 外孙女儿 ， 竟是 嫡亲 的 孙女儿 似的 ， 怨不得 老祖宗 天天 嘴里 心里 放不下 。,"And everything about her so distingué ' ! She does not take after your side of the family , Grannie . She is more like a Jia . I do not blame you for having gone on so about her during the past few days - but poor little thing !"
— — 只 可怜 我 这 妹妹 这么 命苦 ， 怎么 姑妈 偏 就 去世 了 呢 ！ ”,What a cruel fate to have lost Auntie like that ! '
说 着 便 用 帕 拭泪 ， 贾母笑 道 ： “ 我 才 好 了 ， 你 又 来 招 我 。,"and she dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief . ' I have only just recovered , ' laughed Grandmother Jia . ' Do not you go trying to start me off again !"
你 妹妹 远路 才 来 ， 身子 又 弱 ， 也 才 劝住 了 ， 快别 再 提 了 。 ”,"Besides , your little cousin is not very strong , and we have only just managed to get her cheered up . So let is have no more of this ! '"
熙凤 听 了 ， 忙 转悲为喜 道 ： “ 正是 呢 ！,"In obedience to the command Xi-feng at once exchanged her grief for merriment . ' Yes , of course ."
我一 见 了 妹妹 ， 一心 都 在 他 身上 ， 又 是 喜欢 ， 又 是 伤心 ， 竟 忘 了 老祖宗 了 ， 该 打 ， 该 打 ！ ”,"It was just that seeing my little cousin here put everything else out of my mind . It made me want to laugh and cry all at the same time . I am afraid I quite forgot about you , Grannie dear . I deserve to be spanked , do not I ? '"
又 忙 拉 着 黛玉 的 手 问道 ：,She grabbed Dai-yu by the hand .
“ 妹妹 几岁 了 ？,' How old are you dear ?
可 也 上过 学 ？,Have you begun school yet ?
现 吃 什么 药 ？,You must not feel homesick here .
在 这里 别想家 ， 要 什么 吃 的 、 什么 玩 的 ， 只管 告诉 我 ；,"If there is anything you want to eat or anything you want to play with , just come and tell me ."
丫头 老婆 们 不好 ， 也 只管 告诉 我 。,And you must tell me if any of the maids or the old nannies are nasty to you . '
黛玉 一一 答应 。,Dai-yu made appropriate responses to all of these questions and injunctions .
一面 熙凤 又 问 人 ：,Xi-feng turned to the servants .
“ 林姑娘 的 东西 可 搬进 来 了 ？,' Have Miss Lin is things been brought in yet ?
带 了 几个 人 来 ？,How many people did she bring with her ?
你们 赶早 打扫 两间 屋子 叫 他们 歇歇 儿 去 。 ”,You would better hurry up and get a couple of rooms swept out for them to rest in . '
说话 时 ， 已 摆 了 果茶 上来 ， 熙凤 亲自 布 让 。,"While Xi-feng was speaking , the servants brought in tea and various plates of food , the distribution of which she proceeded to supervise in person ."
又 见 二舅母 问 他 ： “ 月 钱 放完 了 没有 ？ ”,Dai-yu noticed her Aunt Wang questioning Xi-feng on the side : ' Have this month 's allowances been paid out yet ? '
熙凤道 ： “ 放完 了 。 刚才 带 了 人 到 后 楼上 找 缎子 ， 找 了 半日 ， 也 没见 昨儿 太太 说 的 那个 ， 想必 太太 记错 了 。 ”,"' Yes . By the way , just now I went with some of the women to the upstairs storeroom at the back to look for that satin . We looked and looked , but we could not find any like the one you described yesterday . Perhaps you misremembered . '"
王夫人 道 ： “ 有没有 ， 什么 要紧 。 ”,"' Oh well , if you can not find it , it does not really matter , ' said Lady Wang ."
因 又 说道 ： “ 该 随手 拿出 两个 来 给 你 这 妹妹 裁 衣裳 啊 。,"Then , after a moment 's reflection , ' You would better pick out a couple of lengths presently to have made up into clothes for your little cousin here ."
等 晚上 想着 再 叫 人 去 拿 罢 。 ”,"If you think of it , send someone round in the evening to fetch them ! '"
熙凤道 ： “ 我 倒 先 料着 了 ， 知道 妹妹 这 两日 必 到 ， 我 已经 预备 下 了 ；,"' It is already been seen to . I knew she was going to arrive within a day or two , so I had some brought out in readiness ."
等 太太 回去 过 了 目 ， 好 送来 。 ”,"They are waiting back at your place for your approval . If you think they are all right , they can be sent over straight away . '"
王夫人 一 笑 ， 点头 不语 。,Lady Wang merely smiled and nodded her head without saying anything .
当下 茶果 已 撤 ， 贾母命 两个 老嬷嬷 带 黛玉 去 见 两个 舅舅 去 。,"The tea things and dishes were now cleared away , and Grandmother Jia ordered two old nurses to take Dai-yu round to see her uncles ; but Uncle She is wife , Lady Xing , hurriedly rose to her feet and suggested that it would be more convenient if she were to take her niece round herself ."
维时贾 赦之妻 邢氏 忙 起身 笑 回道 ： “ 我 带 了 外甥 女儿 过去 ， 到底 便宜 些 。 ”,"' Very well , ' said Grandmother Jia ."
贾母笑 道 ： “ 正是 呢 ， 你 也 去 罢 ， 不必 过来 了 。 ”,"' You go now , then . There is no need for you to come back afterwards . '"
那 邢夫人 答应 了 ， 遂 带 着 黛玉 和 王夫人 作辞 ， 大家 送 至 穿堂 。,"So having , together with Lady Wang , who was also returning to her quarters , taken leave of the old lady , Lady Xing went of with Dai-yu , attended across the courtyard as far as the covered way by the rest of the company ."
垂花门 前早 有 众 小厮 拉 过 一辆 翠 幄 青 油车 来 ， 邢夫人 携 了 黛玉 坐 上 ， 众 老婆 们 放 下车 帘 ， 方命 小厮 们 抬起 ， 拉至宽 处 ， 驾 上 驯 骡 ， 出 了 西 角门 往 东 ， 过荣府 正门 ， 入 一 黑 油漆 大门 内 ， 至 仪 门前 ， 方下 了 车 。,"A carriage painted dark blue and hung with kingfisher-blue curtains had been drawn up in front of the ornamental gateway by some pages . Into this Aunt Xing ascended hand in hand with Dai-yu . The old women pulled down the carriage blind and ordered the pages to take up the shafts , the pages drew the carriage into an open space and harnessed mules to it , and Dai-yu and her aunt were driven out of the west gate , eastwards past the main gate of the Rong mansion , in again through a big black-lacquered gate , and up to an inner gate , where they were set down again ."
邢夫人 挽 着 黛玉 的 手 进入 院中 ， 黛玉度 其处 必 是 荣府 中 之 花园 隔断 过来 的 。,"Holding Dai-yu by the hand , Aunt Xing led her into a courtyard in the middle of what she imagined must once have been part of the mansion 's gardens ."
进入 三层 仪门 ， 果见 正房 、 厢房 、 游廊 悉皆 小巧 别致 ， 不 似 那边 的 轩峻 壮丽 ； 且 院中 随处 之 树木 山石 皆 好 。,"This impression was strengthened when they passed through a third gateway into the quarters occupied by her uncle and aunt ; for here the smaller scale and quiet elegance of the halls , galleries and loggias were quite unlike the heavy magnificence and imposing grandeur they had just come from , and ornamental trees and artificial rock formations , all in exquisite taste , were to be seen on every hand ."
及 进入 正室 ， 早 有 许多 艳妆 丽服之 姬 妾 丫鬟 迎 着 。,"As they entered the main reception hall , a number of heavily made-up and expensively dressed maids and concubines , who had been waiting in readiness , came forward to greet them ."
邢夫人 让 黛玉 坐 了 ， 一面 令人 到 外 书房 中 请 贾 赦 。,Aunt Xing asked Dai-yu to be seated while she sent a servant to call Uncle She .
一时 回来 说 ： “ 老爷 说 了 ： ‘ 连日 身上 不好 ， 见 了 姑娘 彼此 伤心 ， 暂且 不忍 相见 。,"After a considerable wait the servant returned with the following message : ' The Master says he hasn ' t been well these last few days , and as it would only upset them both if he were to see Miss Lin now , he does not feel up to it for the time being ."
劝 姑娘 不必 伤怀 想 家 ， 跟着 老太太 和 舅母 ， 是 和 家里 一样 的 。,"He says , tell Miss Lin not to grieve and not to feel homesick . She must think of her grandmother and her aunts as her own family now ."
姐妹 们 虽 拙 ， 大家 一处 作伴 ， 也 可以 解 些 烦闷 。,"He says that her cousins may not be very clever girls , but at least they should be company for her and help to take her mind off things ."
或 有 委屈 之 处 ， 只管 说 ， 别 外道 了 才 是 。 ”,"If she finds anything at all here to distress her , she is to speak up at once . She must not feel like an outsider . She is to make herself completely at home . '"
黛玉忙 站 起身 来 一一 答应 了 。,Dai-yu stood up throughout this recital and murmured polite assent whenever assent seemed indicated .
再 坐 一刻 ， 便 告辞 ， 邢夫人 苦留 吃过饭 去 ， 黛玉笑 回道 ： “ 舅母 爱惜 赐 饭 ， 原不 应辞 ， 只是 还要 过去 拜见 二 舅舅 ， 恐 去 迟 了 不恭 ， 异日 再 领 ： 望 舅母 容谅 。 ”,"She then sat for about another quarter of an hour before rising to take her leave . Her Aunt Xing was very pressing that she should have a meal with her before she went , but Dai-yu smilingly replied that though it was very kind of her aunt to offer , and though she ought really not to refuse , nevertheless she still had to pay her respects to her Uncle Zheng , and feared that it would be disrespectful if she were to arrive late . She hoped that she might accept on another occasion and begged her aunt to excuse her ."
邢夫人 道 ： “ 这 也罢 了 。 ” 遂 命 两个 嬷嬷 用 方才 坐来 的 车 送 过去 。,"' In that case , never mind , said Lady Xing , and instructed the old nurses to see her to her Uncle Zheng 's in the same carriage she had come by ."
于是 黛玉 告辞 。 邢夫人 送至 仪 门前 ， 又 嘱咐 了 众人 几句 ， 眼看 着 车 去 了 方 回来 。,"Dai-yu formally took her leave , and Lady Xing saw her as far as the inner gate , where she issued a few more instructions to the servants and watched her niece 's carriage out of sight before returning to her rooms ."
一时 黛玉 进入 荣府 ， 下 了 车 ， 只见 一条 大 甬路 ， 直接 出 大门 来 ， 众 嬷嬷 引着 便 往 东 转弯 ， 走过 一座 东西 穿堂 、 向 南 大厅 之后 ， 仪 门内 大 院落 ， 上面 五间 大 正房 ， 两边 厢房 鹿顶 ， 耳门 钻山 ， 四通八达 ， 轩昂 壮丽 ， 比 各处 不同 ， 黛玉 便 知 这方 是 正 内室 。,"Presently they re-entered the Rong mansion proper and Dai-yu got down from the carriage . There was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate , along which the old nurses now conducted her . Turning right , they led her down a roofed passage-way along the back of a south-facing hall , then through an inner gate into a large courtyard . The big building at the head of the courtyard was connected at each end to galleries running through the length of the side buildings by means of ' stag 's head ' roofing over the corners . The whole formed an architectural unit of greater sumptuousness and magnificence than anything Dai-yu had yet seen that day , from which she concluded that this must be the main inner hall of the whole mansion ."
进入 堂屋 ， 抬头 迎面 先见 一个 赤金 九龙 青地大 匾 ， 匾 上 写 着 斗 大 三个 ， 字 是 ： “ 荣禧堂 ” ， 后 有 一行 小字 ： “ 某 年月日 书赐 荣国公 贾源 ” ， 又 有 “ 万几 宸 翰 ” 之 宝 。,"High overhead on the wall facing her as she entered the hall was a great blue board framed in gilded dragons , on which was written in large gold characters THE HALL OF EXALTED FELICITY with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words ' ... written for Our beloved Subject , Jia Yuan , Duke of Rong-guo ' , followed by the Emperor 's private seal , a device containing the words ' kingly cares ' and ' royal brush ' in archaic sealscript ."
大 紫檀 雕 螭 案 上 设 着 三尺 多 高 青绿 古铜鼎 ， 悬 着 待 漏随 朝 墨 龙大 画 ， 一边 是 錾 金彝 ， 一边 是 玻璃盆 ， 地下 两溜 十六张 楠木 圈椅 ， 又 有 一副 对联 ， 乃是 乌木 联牌 镶着 錾金 字迹 ， 道 是 ：,"A long , high table of carved red sandalwood , ornamented with dragons , stood against the wall underneath . In the centre of this was a huge antique bronze ding , fully a yard high , covered with a green patina . On the wall above the ding hung a long vertical scroll with an ink-painting of a dragon emerging from clouds and waves , of the kind often presented to high court officials in token of their office . The ding was flanked on one side by a smaller antique bronze vessel with a pattern of gold inlay and on the other by a crystal bowl . At each side of the table stood a row of eight yellow cedar-wood armchairs with their backs to the wall ; and above the chairs hung , one on each side , a pair of vertical ebony boards inlaid with a couplet in characters of gold :"
,( on the right-hand one )
座 上 珠玑 昭 日月 ，,May the jewel of learning shine 17 this house more effulgently than the sun and moon .
,( on the left-hand one )
堂 前 黼 黻 焕 烟霞 。,May the msignia of honour glitter in these halls more brilliantly than the starry sky .
下面 一行 小字 ， 是 “ 世教 弟勋 袭 东 安郡王 穆莳拜 手书 ” 。,"This was followed by a colophon in smaller characters : With the Respectful Compliments of your Fellow-Student , Mu Shi , Hereditary Prince of Dong-an ."
原来 王夫人 时常 居坐 宴息 也 不 在 这 正室 中 ， 只 在 东边 的 三间 耳房 内 。,"Lady Wang did not , however , normally spend her leisure hours in this main reception hall , but in a smaller room on the east side of the same building ."
于是 嬷嬷 们 引 黛玉进东 房门 来 ：,Accordingly the nurses conducted Dai-yu through the door into this side apartment .
临 窗 大 炕 上铺 着 猩红 洋毯 ， 正面 设 着 大红 金线 蟒引枕 ， 秋香色 金钱 蟒大 条褥 ， 两边 设 一对 梅花 式 洋漆小 几 ， 左边 几上 摆 着 文王 鼎 ， 鼎 旁匙 箸 香盒 ， 右边 几上 摆 着 汝窑 美 人 觚 ， 里面 插 着 时 鲜花 草 ；,"Here there was a large kang underneath the window , covered with a scarlet Kashmir rug . In the middle of the kang was a dark-red bolster with a pattern of medallions in the form of tiny dragons , and a long russet-green seating strip in the same pattern . A low rose-shaped table of coloured lacquer-work stood at each side . On the left-hand one was a small , square , four-legged ding , together with a bronze ladle , metal chopsticks , and an incense container . On the right-hand one was a narrow-waisted Ru-ware imitation gu with a spray of freshly cut flowers in it ."
地 下面 西 一溜 四 张大椅 ， 都 搭 着 银红 撒花 椅 搭 ， 底下 四 副 脚踏 ；,In the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the east wall . All had footstools in front of them and chair-backs and seat-covers in old rose brocade sprigged with flowers .
两边 又 有 一对 高 几 ， 几 上 茗 碗 瓶花 俱备 。 其余 陈设 ， 不必 细说 。,"There were also narrow side-tables on which tea things and vases of flowers were arranged , besides other furnishings which it would be superfluous to enumerate ."
老嬷嬷 让 黛玉 上 炕 坐 ， 炕沿 上 却 也 有 两个 锦褥 对设 ， 黛玉 度 其 位次 ， 便 不 上 炕 ， 只 就 东边 椅 上 坐 了 。,"The old nurses invited Dai-yu to get up on the kang ; but guessing that the brocade cushions arranged one on each side near the edge of it must be her uncle 's and aunt 's places , she deemed it more proper to sit on one of the chairs against the wall below ."
本房 的 丫鬟 忙 捧 上 茶 来 ， 黛玉 一面 吃 了 ， 打量 这些 丫鬟 们 妆饰 衣裙 、 举止 行动 ， 果 与 别家 不同 。,"The maids in charge of the apartment served tea , and as she sipped it Dai-yu observed that their clothing , makeup , and deportment were quite different from those of the maids she had seen so far in other parts of the mansion ."
茶 未 吃 了 ， 只见 一个 穿 红 绫袄 青绸 掐 牙 背心 的 一个 丫鬟 走来 笑 道 ：,"Before she had time to finish her tea , a smiling maid came in wearing a dress of red damask and a black silk sleeveless jacket which had scalloped borders of some coloured material ."
“ 太太 说 ： 请 林姑娘 到 那边 坐 罢 。 ”,"' The Mistress says will Miss Lin come over to the other side , please . '"
老嬷嬷 听 了 ， 于是 又 引 黛玉 出来 ， 到 了 东廊 三间 小 正房 内 ：,The old nurses now led Dai-yu down the east gallery to a reception room at the side of the courtyard .
正面 炕上 横设 一张 炕桌 ， 上面 堆 着 书籍 茶具 ， 靠 东 壁面 西 设 着 半旧 的 青缎 靠背 引枕 ， 王夫人 却 坐在 西边 下首 ， 亦 是 半旧 青缎 靠背 坐褥 ； 见 黛玉 来 了 ， 便 往 东 让 。 黛玉 心中 料定 这 是 贾政之 位 ， 因见 挨 炕 一溜 三张 椅子 上 也 搭 着 半旧 的 弹花 椅袱 ， 黛玉 便 向 椅 上 坐 了 。,"This too had a kang . It was bisected by a long , low table piled with books and tea things . A much-used black satin back-rest was pushed up against the east wall . Lady Wang was seated on a black satin cushion and leaning against another comfortable-looking back-rest of black satin somewhat farther forward on the opposite side . Seeing her niece enter , she motioned her to sit opposite her on the kang , but Dai-yu felt sure that this must be her Uncle Zheng 's place . So , having observed a row of three chairs near the kang with covers of flower-sprigged brocade which looked as though they were in fairly constant use , she sat upon one of those instead ."
王夫人 再三 让 他 上 炕 ， 他 方 挨 王夫人 坐下 。,"Only after much further pressing from her aunt would she get up on the kang , and even then she would only sit beside her and not in the position of honour opposite ."
王夫人 因说 ： “ 你 舅舅 今日 斋戒 去 了 ， 再见 罢 。,"' Your uncle is in retreat today , ' said Lady Wang . ' He will see you another time ."
只是 有 句 话 嘱咐 你 ：,"There is , however , something I have got to talk to you about ."
你 三个 姐妹 倒 都 极好 ， 以后 一处 念书 认字 ， 学 针线 ， 或 偶一 玩笑 ， 却 都 有 个 尽 让 的 。,"The three girls are very well-behaved children , and in future , when you are studying or sewing together , even if once in a while they may grow a bit high-spirited , I can depend on them not to go too far ."
— — 我 就 只 一件 不 放心 ：,There is only one thing that worries me .
我 有 一个 孽根祸胎 ， 是 家里 的 ‘ 混世魔王 ’ ， 今日 因 往 庙里 还愿 去 ， 尚未 回来 ， 晚上 你 看见 就 知道 了 。,I have a little monster of a son who tyrannizes over all the rest of this household . He has gone of to the temple today in fulfillment of a vow and is not yet back ; but you will see what I mean this evening .
你 以后 总 不用 理会 他 ， 你 这些 姐姐 妹妹 都 不敢 沾惹 他 的 。 ”,The thing to do is never to take any notice of him . None of your cousins dare provoke him . '
黛玉 素闻 母亲 说 过 ， 有个 内侄 乃 衔 玉 而 生 ， 顽劣 异常 ， 不 喜 读书 ， 最喜 在内 帏 厮混 ；,Dai-yu had long ago been told by her mother that she had a boy cousin who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth and who was exceptionally wild and naughty . He hated study and liked to spend all his time in the women 's apartments with the girls ; but because
外祖母 又 溺爱 ， 无人 敢管 。,"Grandmother Jia doted on him so much , no one ever dared to correct him ."
今 见 王夫人 所说 ， 便 知 是 这位 表兄 ， 一面 陪笑 道 ： “ 舅母 所说 ， 可是 衔 玉而生 的 ？,"She realized that it must be this cousin her aunt was now referring to . ' Do you mean the boy born with the jade , Aunt ? ' she asked ."
在家 时 记得 母亲 常 说 ， 这位 哥哥 比 我 大一岁 ， 小名 就 叫 宝玉 ， 性 虽 憨顽 ， 说待 姊妹 们 却是 极好 的 。,"' Mother often told me about him at home . She told me that he was one year older than me and that his name was Bao-yu . But she said that though he was very willful , he always behaved very nicely to girls ."
况 我 来 了 ， 自然 和 姊妹 们 一处 ， 弟兄们 是 另 院 别房 ， 岂 有 沾惹 之 理 ？ ”,"Now that I am here , I suppose I shall be spending all my time with my girl cousins and not in the same part of the house as the boys . Surely there will be no danger of my provoking him ? '"
王夫人 笑 道 ：,Lady Wang gave a rueful smile .
“ 你 不 知道 原故 ：,' You little know how things are here !
他 和 别人 不同 ， 自幼 因 老太太 疼爱 ， 原系 和 姐妹 们 一处 娇养 惯 了 的 。,"Bao-yu is a law unto himself . Because your grand-mother is so fond of him she has thoroughly spoiled him . When he was little he lived with the girls , so with the girls he remains now ."
若 姐妹 们 不理 他 ， 他 倒 还 安静 些 ；,"As long as they take no notice of him , things run quietly enough ."
若 一日 姐妹 们 和 他 多 说 了 一句 话 ， 他 心上 一 喜 ， 便 生出 许多 事来 。,"But if they give him the least encouragement , he at once becomes excitable , and then there is no end to the mischief he may get up to ."
所以 嘱咐 你 别 理会 他 ， 他 嘴里 一时 甜言蜜语 ， 一时 有天没日 ， 疯疯 傻傻 ：,That is why I counsel you to ignore him . He can be all honey-sweet words one minute and ranting and raving like a lunatic the next .
只 休信 他 。 ”,So do not believe anything he says . '
黛玉 一一 的 都 答应 着 。,Dai-yu promised to follow her aunt 's advice .
忽 见 一个 丫鬟 来说 ： “ 老太太 那里 传 晚饭 了 。 ” 王夫人 忙 携 了 黛玉 出 后 房门 ， 由后 廊 往 西 ， 出 了 角门 ， 是 一条 南北 甬路 ， 南边 是 倒 座 三间 小小 抱厦 厅 ， 北边 立 着 一个 粉油 大 影壁 ， 后 有 一个半 大门 ， 小小 一所 房屋 ， 王夫人 笑 指 向黛玉 道 ： “ 这 是 你 凤姐姐 的 屋子 ， 回来 你好 往 这里 找 他 去 ， 少 什么 东西 只管 和 他 说 就是 了 。 ”,"Just then a maid came in with a message that ' Lady Jia said it was time for dinner ' , whereupon Lady Wang took Dai-yu by the hand and hurried her out through a back door . Passing along a verandah which ran beneath the rear eaves of the hall they came to a corner gate through which they passed into an alley-way running north and south . At the south end it was traversed by a narrow little building with a short passage-way running through its middle . At the north end was a white-painted screen wall masking a medium-sized gateway leading to a small courtyard in which stood a very little house . ' That , ' said Lady Wang , pointing to the little house , ' is where your Cousin Lian 's wife , Wang Xi-feng , lives , in case you want to see her later on . She is the person to talk to if there is anything you need . '"
这 院门 上 也 有 几个 才 总角 的 小厮 ， 都 垂手 侍立 。,"There were a few young pages at the gate of the courtyard who , when they saw Lady Wang coming , all stood to attention with their hands at their sides ."
王夫人 遂 携 黛玉 穿过 一个 东西 穿堂 ， 便是 贾母 的 后院 了 ， 于是 进入 后 房门 ， 一一 已有 许多 人 在 此 伺候 ， 见 王夫人 来 ， 方 安设 桌椅 ；,"Lady Wang now led Dai-yu along a gallery , running from east to west , which brought them out into the courtyard behind Grandmother Jia is apartments . Entering these by a back entrance , they found a number of servants waiting there who , as soon as they saw Lady Wang , began to arrange the table and chairs for dinner ."
,The ladies of the house themselves took part in the service .
贾珠之 妻 李氏 捧杯 ， 熙凤 安 箸 ， 王夫人 进 羹 。,"Li Wan brought in the cups , Xi-feng laid out the chopsticks , and Lady Wang brought in the soup ."
贾母正 面榻 上 独坐 ， 两旁 四张 空椅 ， 熙凤忙 拉黛玉 在 左边 第一张 椅子 上 坐下 ， 黛玉 十分 推让 ， 贾母笑 道 ： “ 你 舅母 和 嫂子 们 是 不 在 这里 吃饭 的 。 你 是 客 ， 原该 这么 坐 。 ”,"The table at which Grandmother Jia presided , seated alone on a couch , had two empty chairs on either side . Xi-feng tried to seat Dai-yu in the one on the left nearer to her grandmother - an honour which she strenuously resisted until her grandmother explained that her aunt and her elder cousins ' wives would not be eating with them , so that , - since she was a guest , the place was properly hers ."
黛玉方 告 了 坐 ， 就 坐 了 。,"Only then did she ask permission to sit , as etiquette prescribed ."
贾母命 王夫人 也 坐 了 。,Grandmother Jia then ordered Lady Wang to be seated .
迎春 姊妹 三个 告 了 坐 方 上来 ， 迎春 坐 右手 第一 ， 探春 左 第二 ， 惜春右 第二 。,"This was the cue for the three girls to ask permission to sit . Ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite Dai-yu , Tan-chun sat second on the left , and Xi-chun sat second on the right ."
旁边 丫鬟 执着 拂尘 漱 盂 巾帕 ， 李 纨凤姐 立于 案边 布让 ；,"While Li Wan and Xi-feng stood by the table helping to distribute food from the dishes , maids holding fly-whisks , spittoons , and napkins ranged themselves on either side ."
外间 伺候 的 媳妇 丫鬟 虽 多 ， 却连 一声 咳嗽 不 闻 。,"In addition to these , there were numerous other maids and serving-women in attendance in the outer room yet not so much as a cough was heard throughout the whole of the meal ."
饭 毕 ， 各 各 有 丫鬟 用 小 茶盘 捧 上 茶 来 。,"When they had finished eating , a maid served each diner with tea on a little tray ."
当日 林 家教 女 以 惜福 养身 ， 每 饭后 必过 片时 方 吃 茶 ， 不伤脾胃 ；,"Daiyu is parents had brought their daughter up to believe that good health was founded on careful habits , and in pursuance of this principle , had always insisted that after a meal one should allow a certain interval to elapse before taking tea in order to avoid indigestion ."
今黛玉 见 了 这里 许多 规矩 ， 不 似 家中 ， 也 只得 随和 些 ， 接 了 茶 。,"However , she could see that many of the rules in this household were different from the ones she had been used to at home ; so , being anxious to conform as much as possible , she accepted the tea ."
又 有人 捧 过 漱 盂 来 ， 黛玉 也 漱 了 口 ， 又 盥手 毕 。,"But as she did so , another maid preferred a spittoon , from which she inferred that the tea was for rinsing her mouth with ."
然后 又 捧 上 茶 来 ， — — 这方 是 吃 的 茶 。,"And it was not , in fact , until they had all rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands that another lot of tea was served , this time for drinking ."
贾母 便 说 ： “ 你们 去 罢 ， 让 我们 自 在 说说话 儿 。 ”,"Grandmother Jia now dismissed her lady servers , observing that she wished to enjoy a little chat with her young grandchildren without the restraint of their grown-up presence ."
王夫人 遂 起身 ， 又 说 了 两句 闲话 儿 ， 方引 李凤 二人 去 了 。,"Lady Wang obediently rose to her feet and , after exchanging a few pleasantries , went out , taking Li Wan and Wang Xi-feng with her ."
贾母因 问黛玉 念 何书 ， 黛玉 道 ： “ 刚 念 了 《 四书 》 。 ” 黛玉 又 问 姊妹 们 读 何书 ， 贾母 道 ： “ 读 什么 书 ， 不过 认 几个 字 罢了 ！ ”,"Grandmother Jia asked Dai-yu what books she was studying . ' The Four Books , ' said Dai-yu , and inquired in turn what books her cousins were currently engaged on . ' Gracious , child , they do not study books , ' said her grandmother ; ' they can barely read and write ! '"
一 语 未了 ， 只 听 外面 一阵 脚步 响 ， 丫鬟 进来 报道 ： “ 宝玉 来 了 。 ”,"While they were speaking , a flurry of footsteps could be heard outside and a maid came in to say that Bao-yu was back ."
黛玉 心想 ： “ 这个 宝玉 不知 是 怎样 个 惫懒 人 呢 ！ ”,"' I wonder , ' thought Dai-yu , just what sort of graceless creature this Bao-yu is going to be ! '"
及至 进来 一 看 ， 却是 位 青年 公子 ： 头上 戴 着 束发 嵌 宝紫 金冠 ， 齐眉 勒 着 二龙戏珠 金 抹额 ， 一件 二色 金百蝶 穿 花 大红 箭袖 ， 束 着 五彩 丝攒 花结 长穗宫 绦 ， 外罩 石青 起 花 八团 倭 缎 排 穗 褂 ， 登 着 青缎 粉底 小朝 靴 ；,"The young gentleman who entered in answer to her unspoken question had a small jewel-encrusted gold coronet on the top of his head and a golden headband low down over his brow in the form of two dragons playing with a large pearl . He was wearing a narrow-sleeved , full-skirted robe of dark red material with a pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold . It was confined at the waist with a court girdle of coloured silks braided at regular intervals into elaborate clusters of knotwork and terminating in long tassels . Over the upper part of his robe he wore a jacket of slate-blue Japanese silk damask with a raised pattern of eight large medallions on the front and with tasselled borders . On his feet he had half-length dress boots of black satin with thick white soles ."
,"As to his person , he had :"
面 若 中秋 之月 ， 色 如 春晓 之 花 ， 鬓 若 刀裁 ， 眉如 墨画 ， 鼻如悬胆 ， 睛 若 秋波 ， 虽 怒 时而 似 笑 ， 即 瞋视 而 有情 ；,"a face like the moon of Mid-Autumn , a complerion like flowers at dawn , a hairline straight as a knife-cut , evebrows that might have been painted by an artist 's brush , a shapely nose , and eyes clear as limpid pools , that even in anger seemed to smule , and , as they glared , beamed tenderness the while ."
项上 金螭 缨络 ， 又 有 一根 五色 丝绦 ， 系 着 一块 美玉 。,Around his neck he wore a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon and a woven cord of coloured silks to which the famous jade was attached .
黛玉 一 见 便 吃 一大 惊 ， 心中 想道 ： “ 好生 奇怪 ， 倒象 在 那里 见 过 的 ， 何等 眼熟 ！ … … ”,"Dai-yu looked at him with astonishment . How strange ! How very strange ! It was as though she had seen him somewhere before , he was so extraordinarily familiar ."
只见 这 宝玉 向 贾母 请 了 安 ， 贾母 便命 ： “ 去 见 你 娘 来 。 ” 即 转身 去 了 。,"Bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother , who told him to come after he had seen his mother , whereupon he turned round and walked straight out again ."
一回 再 来时 ， 已 换 了 冠带 ：,"Quite soon he was back once more , this time dressed in a completely different outfit . The crown and circlet had gone ."
头上 周围 一 转 的 短发 ， 都 结成 小辫 ， 红丝 结束 ， 共 攒 至 顶中 胎发 ， 总编 一根 大 辫 ， 黑亮 如 漆 ， 从 顶 至 梢 ， 一串 四颗 大 珠 ， 用金 八宝 坠 脚 ；,"She could now see that his side hair was dressed in a number of small braids plaited with red silk , which were drawn round to join the long hair at the back in a single large queue of glistening jet black , fastened at intervals from the nape downwards with four enormous pearls and ending in a jewelled gold clasp ."
身上 穿着 银红 撒花 半旧 大袄 ；,"He had changed his robe and jacket for a rather more worn-looking rose-coloured gown , sprigged with flowers ."
仍旧 带 着 项圈 、 宝玉 、 寄名 锁 、 护身符 等物 ；,"He wore the gold torque and his jade as before , and she observed that the collection of objects round his neck had been further augmented by a padlock-shaped amulet and a lucky charm ."
下面 半露 松绿 撒花 绫裤 ， 锦边 弹墨 袜 ， 厚底 大红 鞋 ：,"A pair of ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown , thrust into black and white socks trimmed with brocade . In place of the formal boots he was wearing thick-soled crimson slippers ."
,She was even more struck than before by his fresh complexion .
越 显得 面如傅粉 ， 唇若施脂 ；,"The cheeks might have been brushed with powder and the lips touched with rouge , so bright was their natural colour ."
转盼 多情 ， 语言 若 笑 ；,"His glance was soulful , vet from his lips the laughter often leaped ;"
天然 一段 风韵 ， 全 在 眉梢 ；,a world of charm upon that brow was heaped ;
平生 万种 情思 ， 悉 堆 眼角 。,a world of feeling from those dark eyes peeped .
— — 看 其 外貌 ， 最 是 极好 ， 却 难知 其 底细 ， 后人 有 《 西江月 》 二 词 批 的 极确 ， 词曰 ：,"In short , his outward appearance was very fine . But appearances can be misleading . A perceptive poet has supplied two sets of verses , to be sung to the tune of Moon On West River , which contain a more accurate appraisal of our hero than the foregoing descriptions ."
,1
无故 寻愁 觅恨 ，,Oft-times he sought out what would make him sad ;
有时 似 傻 如 狂 ；,Sometimes an idiot seemed and sometimes mad .
纵然 生 得 好 皮囊 ，,"Though outwardly a handsome sausage-skin ,"
腹内 原来 草莽 。,He proved to have but sorry meat within .
潦倒 不通 庶务 ，,"A harum-scarum , to all duty blind ,"
愚顽 怕 读 文章 ；,"A doltish mule , to study disinclined ;"
行为 偏僻 性 乖张 ，,His acts outlandish and his nature queer ;
那管 世人 诽谤 ！,Yet not a whit cared he how folk might jeer !
又 曰 ：,2
富贵 不知 乐业 ，,"Prosperous , he could not play his part with grace ,"
贫穷 难耐 凄凉 ；,"Nor , poor , bear hardship with a smiling face ."
可怜 辜负 好时光 ，,So shamefully the precious hours he would waste
于国 于 家 无望 。,That both indoors and out he was disgraced .
天下 无能 第一 ，,For uselessness the world 's prize he might bear ;
古今 不肖 无双 ；,His gracelessness in history has no peer .
寄言 纨绛 与 膏粱 ：,Let gilded youths who every dainty sample
莫效 此儿 形状 ！,Not imitate this rascal 's dire example !
却说 贾母 见 他 进来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 外客 没见 就 脱 了 衣裳 了 ！,' Fancy changing your clothes before you have welcomed the visitor ! ' Grandmother Jia chided indulgently on seeing Bao-yu back again .
还 不 去 见 你 妹妹 呢 。 ”,' Are not you going to pay your respects to your cousin ? '
宝玉 早已 看见 了 一个 袅袅婷婷 的 女儿 ， 便 料定 是 林 姑妈 之 女 ， 忙 来 见 礼 ；,"Bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender , delicate girl whom he surmised to be his Aunt Lin is daughter and quickly went over to greet her ."
归 了 坐 细看 时 ， 真是 与 众 各别 。,"Then , returning to his place and taking a seat , he studied her attentively . How different she seemed from the other girls he knew !"
只见 ：,
两 弯似 蹙 非 蹙 笼烟眉 ，,"Her mist-wreathed brows at first seemed to frown , yet were not frowning ;"
一双 似 喜非 喜 含情 目 。,"Her passionate eyes at first seemed to smile , yet were not merry ."
态生 两 靥 之 愁 ，,Habit had given a melancholy cast to her tender face ;
娇 袭 一身 之病 。,Nature had bestowed a sickly constitution on her delicate frame .
泪光 点点 ，,Often the eyes swam with glistening tears ;
娇喘 微微 。,Often the breath came in gentle gasps .
闲静 似娇花照水 ，,In stillness she made one think of 4 graceful flower reflected in the water ;
行动 如 弱柳扶风 。,In motion she called to mind tender willow shoots caressed by the wind .
心 较 比 干 多 一窍 ，,She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan ;
病 如 西子胜 三分 。,And suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi .
宝玉 看 罢 ， 笑 道 ： “ 这个 妹妹 我 曾 见 过 的 。 ”,"Having completed his survey , Bao-yu gave a laugh . ' I have seen this cousin before . '"
贾母笑 道 ： “ 又 胡说 了 ！,' Nonsense ! ' said Grandmother Jia .
你 何曾 见 过 ？ ”,' How could you possibly have done ? '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 虽 没见 过 ， 却 看着 面善 ， 心里 倒 象是 远 别 重逢 的 一般 。 ”,"' Well , perhaps not , said Bao-yu , ' but her face seems so familiar that I have the impression of meeting her again after a long separation . '"
贾母笑 道 ： “ 好 ！,"' All the better , ' said Grandmother Jia ."
好 ！ 这么 更相 和睦 了 。 ”,' That means that you should get on well together . '
宝玉 便 走 向黛玉 身边 坐下 ， 又 细细 打量 一番 ， 因 问 ： “ 妹妹 可 曾 读书 ？ ”,"Bao-yu moved over again and , drawing a chair up beside Dai-yu , recommenced his scrutiny . Presently : ' Do you study books yet , cousin ? '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 不曾 读书 ， 只上 了 一年 学 ， 些须 认得 几个 字 。 ”,"' No , said Dai-yu . ' I have only been taking lessons for a year or so . I can barely read and write . '"
宝玉 又 道 ： “ 妹妹 尊名 ？ ”,' What is your name ? '
黛玉 便 说 了 名 ， 宝玉 又 道 ： “ 表字 ？ ”,Dai-yu told him .
,' What is your school-name ? '
黛玉 道 ： “ 无字 。 ”,' I haven ' t got one . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 送 妹妹 一 字 ， 莫若 ‘ 颦 颦 ’ 二 字 极妙 。 ”,"Bao-yu laughed . ' I will give you one , cousin . I think "" Frowner "" would suit you perfectly . '"
探春 便 道 ： “ 何处 出典 ？ ”,' Where is your reference ? ' said Tan-chun .
宝玉 道 ： “ 《 古今 人物 通考 》 上 说 ： ‘ 西方 有 石名 黛 ， 可代 画眉 之 墨 。 ’,"' In the Encyclopedia of Men and Objects Ancient and Modern it says that somewhere in the West there is a mineral called "" dai "" which can be used instead of eye-black for painting the eyebrows with ."
况 这 妹妹 眉尖 若 蹙 ， 取 这个 字 岂 不美 ？ ”,"She has this "" dai "" in her name and she knits her brows together in a little frown . I think it is a splendid name for her ! '"
探春 笑 道 ： “ 只怕 又 是 杜撰 ！ ”,"' I expect you made it up , ' said Tan-chun scornfully ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 除了 《 四书 》 ， 杜撰 的 也 太 多 呢 。 ”,"' What if I did ? ' said Bao-yu . ' There are lots of made-up things in books - apart from the Four Books , of course . '"
因 又 问 黛玉 ： “ 可有 玉 没有 ？ ”,He returned to his interrogation of Dai-yu . ' Have you got a jade ? '
众人 都 不解 ， 黛玉 便 忖度 着 ： “ 因 他 有 玉 ， 所以 才 问 我 的 。 ”,"The rest of the company were puzzled , but Dai-yu at once divined that he was asking her if she too had a jade like the one he was born with ."
便 答道 ： “ 我 没有 玉 。,"' No , ' said Dal-yu ."
你 那玉 也 是 件 稀罕物 儿 ， 岂能 人人 皆 有 ？ ”,' That jade of yours is a very rare object . You can not expect everybody to have one . '
宝玉 听 了 ， 登时 发作 起 狂病 来 ， 摘下 那玉 ， 就 狠命 摔去 ， 骂 道 ： “ 什么 罕 物 ！,This sent Bao-yu of instantly into one of his mad fits . Snatching the jade from his neck he hurled it violently on the floor as if to smash it and began abusing it passionately . ' Rare object ! Rare object !
人 的 高下 不 识 ， 还 说 灵 不灵 呢 ！,What is so lucky about a stone that can not even tell which people are better than others ?
我 也 不要 这 劳什子 。 ”,Beastly thing ! I do not want it ! '
吓 的 地下 众人 一 拥争 去 拾 玉 。,"The maids all seemed terrified and rushed forward to pick it up , while Grandmother"
贾母 急 的 搂 了 宝玉 道 ： “ 孽障 ！,"Jia clung to Bao-yu in alarm . ' Naughty , naughty boy !"
你 生气 要 打骂 人 容易 ， 何苦 摔 那 命根子 ！ ”,"Shout at someone or strike them if you like when you are in a nasty temper , but why go smashing that precious thing that your very life depends on ? '"
宝玉 满面 泪痕 哭 道 ： “ 家里 姐姐 妹妹 都 没有 ， 单 我 有 ， 我 说 没趣儿 ；,"' None of the girls has got one , said Bao-yu , his face streaming with tears and sobbing hysterically . ' Only I have got one . It always upsets me ."
如今 来 了 这个 神仙 似的 妹妹 也 没有 ： 可知 这 不是 个 好 东西 。 ”,"And now this new cousin comes here who is as beautiful as an angel and she hasn ' t got one either , so I krow it can not be any good . '"
贾母忙 哄 他 道 ： “ 你 这 妹妹 原有 玉 来 着 ， 因 你 姑妈 去世 时 ， 舍不得你 妹妹 ， 无法 可处 ， 遂 将 他 的 玉带 了去 ：,"' Your cousin did have a jade once , ' said Grandmother Jia , coaxing him like a little child , ' but because when Auntie died she could not bear to leave her little girl behind , they had to let her take the jade with her instead ."
一则 全 殉葬 之 礼 ， 尽 你 妹妹 的 孝心 ； 二则 你 姑妈 的 阴灵儿 也 可权 作见 了 你 妹妹 了 。,"In that way your cousin could show her mamma how much she loved her by letting the jade be buried with her ; and at the same time , whenever Auntie is spirit looked at the jade , it would be just like looking at her own little girl again ."
因此 他 说 没有 ， — — 也 是 不便 自己 夸张 的 意思 啊 。,"' So when your cousin said she had not got one , it was only because she did not want to boast about the good , kind thing she did when she gave it to her mamma ."
你 还 不 好生 带上 ， 仔细 你 娘 知道 ！ ”,"Now you put yours on again like a good boy , and mind your mother does not find out how naughty you have been . '"
说 着 便 向 丫鬟 手中 接 来 ， 亲 与 他 带上 。,"So saying , she took the jade from the hands of one of the maids and hung it round his neck for him ."
宝玉 听 如此 说 ， 想 了 一 想 ， 也 就 不生 别论 。,"And Bao-yu , after reflecting for a moment or two on what she had said , offered no further resistance ."
当下 奶娘 来 问 黛玉 房舍 ， 贾母 便 说 ： “ 将 宝玉 挪 出来 ， 同 我 在 套间 暖阁 里 ； 把 你 林姑娘 暂且 安置 在 碧纱 厨里 。,"At this point some of the older women came to inquire what room Dai-yu was to sleep in . ' Move Bao-yu into the closet-bed with me , said Grandmother Jia , ' and put Miss Lin for the time being in the green muslin summer-bed ."
等 过 了 残冬 ， 春天 再 给 他们 收拾 房屋 ， 另 作 一番 安置 罢 。 ”,We had better wait until spring when the last of the cold weather is over before seeing about the rooms for them and getting them settled permanently . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 好 祖宗 ！,"' Dearest Grannie , ' said Bao-yu pleadingly ,"
我 就 在 碧纱 厨 外 的 床上 很 妥当 ， 又 何必 出来 ， 闹 的 老祖宗 不得 安静 呢 ？ ”,' I should be perfectly all right next to the summer-bed . There is no need to move me into your room . I should only keep you awake . '
贾母 想一想 ， 说 ： “ 也罢 了 。 ”,"Grandmother Jia , after a moment 's reflection , gave her consent ."
每人 一个 奶娘 并 一个 丫头 照管 ， 余者 在 外间 上夜 听唤 。,She further gave instructions that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were each to have one nurse and one maid to sleep with them . The rest of their servants were to do night duty by rota in the adjoining room .
一面 早 有 熙凤命 人 送 了 一顶 藕合 色 花帐 并 锦被 缎褥 之类 。,"Xi-feng had already sent across some lilac-coloured hangings , brocade quilts , satin coverlets and the like for Dai-yu 's bedding ."
黛玉 只 带 了 两个 人 来 ： 一个 是 自己 的 奶娘 王嬷嬷 ， 一个 是 十岁 的 小丫头 ， 名唤 雪雁 。,"Dai-yu had brought only two of her own people with her from home . One was her old wet-nurse Nannie Wang , the other was a little ten-year-old maid called Snowgoose ."
贾母 见 雪雁 甚 小 ， 一团 孩气 ， 王嬷嬷 又 极 老 ， 料 黛玉皆 不 遂心 ， 将 自己 身边 一个 二等 小丫头 名唤 ｛ 紫鹃 ｝ 的 与 了 黛玉 ；,"Considering Snowgoose too young and irresponsible and Nannie Wang too old and decrepit to be of much real service , Grandmother Jia gave Dai-yu one of her own maids , a body-servant of the second grade called Nightingale ."
亦 如 迎春 等 一般 ： 每人 除 自幼 乳母 外 ， 另 有 四个 教引 嬷嬷 ； 除 贴身 掌管 钗 钏 盥沐 两个 丫头 外 ， 另 有 四五个 洒扫 房屋 来往 使役 的 小丫头 。,"She also gave orders that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were to be attended in other respects exactly like the three girls : that is to say , apart from the one wet-nurse , each was to have four other nurses to act as chaperones , two maids as body-servants to attend to their washing , dressing , and so forth , and four or five maids for dusting and cleaning , running errands and general duties ."
当下 王嬷嬷 与 ｛ 紫鹃 ｝ 陪侍 黛玉 在 碧纱 厨内 ， 宝玉 乳母 李嬷嬷 并 大 丫头 名唤 袭 人 的 陪侍 在 外面 大 床上 。,"These arrangements completed , Nannie Wang and Nightingale accompanied Dai-yu to bed inside the tent-like summer-bed , while Bao-yu 's wet-nurse Nannie Li and his chief maid Aroma settled him down for the night in a big bed on the other side of the canopy ."
原来 这 袭 人 亦 是 贾母 之 婢 ， 本名 〈 珍珠 〉 ， 贾母因 溺爱 宝玉 ， 恐 宝玉 之婢 不 中 使 ， 素日 〈 珍珠 〉 心地 纯良 ， 遂 与 宝玉 。,"Like Nightingale , Aroma had previously been one of Grandmother Jia 's own maids . Her real name was Pearl . Bao-yu is grandmother , fearful that the maids who already waited on her darling boy could not be trusted to look after him properly , had picked out Pearl as a girl of tried and conspicuous fidelity and put her in charge over them ."
宝玉 因 知 他 本姓 花 ， 又 曾 见 旧人 诗句 有 “ 花气 袭 人 ” 之句 ， 遂 回 明贾母 ， 即 把 〈 珍珠 〉 更名 袭 人 。,"It was Bao-yu who was responsible for the curious name ' Aroma ' . Discovering that Pearl 's surname was Hua , which means ' Flowers ' , and having recently come across the line The flowers ' aroma breathes o hotter days in a book of poems , he told his grandmother that he wanted to call his new maid ' Aroma ' , so ' Aroma ' her name thenceforth became ."
却说 袭 人 倒 有些 痴 处 ： 伏侍贾 母 时 ， 心中 只有 贾母 ； 如今 跟 了 宝玉 ， 心中 又 只有 宝玉 了 。,"Aroma had a certain dogged streak in her nature which had made her utterly devoted to Grandmother Jia as long as she was Grandmother Jia is servant , but which caused her to become just as exclusively and single-mindedly devoted to Bao-yu when her services were transferred to him ."
只 因 宝玉 性情 乖僻 ， 每每 规谏 ， 见 宝玉 不 听 ， 心中 着实 忧郁 。,"Since she found his character strange and incomprehensible , her simple devotion frequently impelled her to remonstrate with him , and when , as invariably happened , he took not the least notice of what she said , she was worried and hurt ."
是 晚 宝玉 李嬷嬷 已 睡 了 ， 他 见 里面 黛玉紫鹃 犹 未 安歇 ， 他 自卸 了妆 ， 悄悄的 进来 ， 笑 问 ： “ 姑娘 怎么 还 不 安歇 ？ ”,"That night , when Bao-yu and Nannie Li were already asleep , Aroma could hear that Dai-yu and Nightingale on their side of the canopy had still not settled down , so , when she had finished taking down her hair and making herself ready for bed , she tiptoed through the muslin curtains and in a friendly way inquired what was the matter ."
黛玉忙 笑 让 ： “ 姐姐 请 坐 。 ” 袭 人 在 床沿 上 坐 了 ， 紫鹃 笑 道 ： “ 林姑娘 在 这里 伤心 ， 自己 淌 眼 抹泪 的 ， 说 ： ‘ 今儿 才 来 了 ， 就 惹出 你们 哥儿 的 病 来 。,"Dai-yu invited her to sit down , and when she had seated herself on the edge of the bed , Nightingale proceeded to tell her what was troubling her new mistress . ' Miss Lin is all upset . She has just been crying her eyes out because she says she only just arrived here today , and yet already she has started young hopeful off on one of his turns ."
倘或 摔坏 了 那玉 ， 岂 不是 因 我 之 过 ！ ’,"She says if that jade had been really smashed , it would have been all her fault ."
所以 伤心 ， 我 好容易 劝好 了 。 ”,That is what she is so upset about . I have had no end of a job trying to comfort her . '
袭 人 道 ： “ 姑娘 快 别 这么着 ！,"' You must not take on so , Miss , ' said Aroma ."
将来 只怕 比 这 更 奇怪 的 笑话 儿 还有 呢 。,' You will see him do much stranger things than that before he is finished .
若为 他 这种 行状 ， 你 多心 伤感 ， 只怕 你 还 伤感 不了 呢 ， 快 别 多心 ！ ”,"If you allow yourself to feel hurt every time he carries on like that , he will always be hurting you . Try not to be so sensitive , Miss ! '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 姐姐 们 说 的 ， 我 记 着 就是 了 。 ” 又 叙 了 一回 ， 方才 安歇 。,"Dai-yu thanked her and promised to bear in mind what she had said , and after talking a little longer , they all settled down and went to sleep ."
次早 起来 ， 省 过 贾母 ， 因 往 王夫人 处来 ， 正值 王夫人 与 熙凤 在 一处 拆 金陵 来 的 书信 ， 又 有 王夫人 的 兄嫂 处 遣来 的 两个 媳妇儿 来 说话 。,"Rising early next day , they visited Grandmother Jia to wish her a good morning and then went over to Lady Wang 's . They found her closeted with Wang Xi-feng , deep in discussion of a letter which had just arrived from Nanking , and attended by two women who had come with a message from Lady Wang 's elder brother and sister-in-law ."
黛玉 虽 不知 原委 ， 探春 等 却 晓得 是 议论 金陵 城中 居住 的 薛家 姨母 之 子 — — 表兄 薛蟠 ， 倚财仗势 ， 打死 人命 ， 现在 应 天府 案 下 审理 ， 如今 舅舅 王子腾 得 了 信 ， 遣 人 来 告诉 这边 ， 意欲 唤取 进京 之 意 。,"Tanchun and the girls told Dai-yu , who knew nothing of the matter under discussion , that they were talking about Xue Pan , the son of their Aunt Xue who lived in Nanking . It seemed that Xue Pan , relying on wealth and family pull to protect him from the consequences , had taken another man is life . The case was at present under investigation by the Ying-tian-fu yamen . Their uncle Wang Zi-teng had been informed of it , and had sent these messengers to the members of the family in the Rong mansion to suggest that they should invite Xue Pan to the capital ."
毕竟 怎的 ， 下回分解 。,But the outcome of this discussion will be dealt with in the following chapter .
第四回,Chapter 4
薄命 女 偏 逢 薄命 郎,The Bottle-gourd girl meets an unfortunate young man
葫芦 僧 判断 葫芦 案,And the Bottle-gourd monk settles a protracted lawsuit
却说 黛玉 同 姐妹 们 至 王夫人 处 ， 见 王夫人 正 和 兄嫂 处 的 来 使 计议 家务 ， 又 说 姨母 家 遭 人命官司 等 语 ；,"When Dai-yu and the girls went to call on Lady Wang , they found her in the midst of discussing family affairs with the messengers from her elder brother and his wife and heard talk of their aunt 's family in Nanking being involved in a case of manslaughter ."
因见 王夫人 事情 冗杂 ， 姐妹 们 遂 出来 ， 至 寡嫂 李氏房 中 来 了 。,"Since Lady Wang was obviously preoccupied with this matter , the girls went of to call on Li Wan ."
原来 这 李氏 即 贾珠之 妻 。,"Li Wan is husband Jia Zhu had died young , but fortunately not without issue ."
珠 虽 夭亡 ， 幸存 一 子 ， 取名 贾兰 ， 今 方 五岁 ， 已 入学 攻书 。,He left her a son called Jia Lan who was now just five years old and had already begun his schooling .
这 李氏 亦 系 金陵 名宦 之 女 ， 父名 李守中 ， 曾 为 国子 祭酒 ；,"Like most of the Jia women , Li Wan was the daughter of a distinguished Nanking official . Her father , Li Shou-zhong , had been a Director of Education ."
族 中 男女 无不 读 诗书 者 ， 至 李守中 继续 以来 ， 便谓 “ 女子 无才 便是 德 ” ， 故 生 了 此 女 不曾 叫 他 十分 认真读书 ， 只不过 将 些 《 女 四书 》 、 《 列女 传 》 读读 ， 认得 几个 字 ， 记得 前朝 这 几个 贤女 便 了 ；,"Up to Li Shou-zhong 's time , all members of the clan , including the women , had been given a first-class education ; but when Li Shou-zhong became head of the family , he founded his educational policy for girls on the good old maxim ' a stupid woman is a virtuous one ' and , when he had a daughter of his own , refused to let her engage in serious study . She was permitted to work her way through The Four Books for Girls and Lives of Noble Women , so that she might be able to recognize a few characters and be familiar with some of the models of female virtue of former ages ;"
却 以 纺绩 女红 为 要 ， 因 取名为 李 纨 ， 字 宫裁 。,"but overriding importance was to be attached to spinning and sewing , and even her name ' Wan ' , which means a kind of silk , was intended to symbolize her dedication to the needle ."
所以 这 李 纨虽 青春 丧偶 ， 且 居 处于 膏粱锦绣 之中 ， 竟 如 “ 槁木死灰 ” 一般 ， 一概 不问不闻 ， 惟知 侍亲 养子 ， 闲时 陪侍 小姑 等 针黹 诵读 而已 。,"Thanks to her upbringing , this young widow living in the midst of luxury and selfindulgence was able to keep herself like the ' withered tree and dead ashes ' of the philosopher , shutting out everything that did not concern her and attending only to the duties of serving her husband 's parents and bringing up her child . Whatever leisure this left her was devoted to her little sister-in-law and cousins , accompanying them at their embroidery or hearing them recite their lessons ."
今黛玉 虽 客居 于 此 ， 已有 这 几个 姑嫂 相伴 ， 除 老父 之外 ， 余者 也 就 无用 虑 了 。,"With such gentle companions to console her , Dai-yu , though a stranger and far from home , soon had nothing apart from her old father that she need worry about ."
如今 且说 贾雨村 授 了 应 天府 ， 一 到任 就 有 件 人命官司 详 至 案 下 ， 却是 两家 争买 一婢 ， 各不相让 ， 以致 殴伤 人命 。,"Let us now turn to the affairs of Jia Yu-cun , newly installed in the yamen at Ying-tian-fu . No sooner had he arrived at his new post than a case involving manslaughter was referred to his tribunal . It concerned two parties in dispute over the purchase of a slave-girl . Neither had been willing to give way to the other , and in the ensuing affray one of the parties had been wounded and had subsequently died ."
彼时 雨村 即 拘 原告 来 审 ， 那 原告 道 ：,"After reading the papers in the case , Yu-cun summoned the plaintiff for questioning and received from him the following account of what had happened :"
“ 被 打死 的 乃是 小人 的 主人 。,"' The murdered man was my master , Your Honour ."
因 那日 买 了 个 丫头 ， 不想 系 拐子 拐来 卖 的 ：,"Although he did not realize it at the time , the girl he purchased had been kidnapped by the man who was selling her ."
这 拐子 先 已 得 了 我家 的 银子 ， 我家 小 主人 原说 第三 日方 是 好 日 ， 再 接入 门 ；,"My master paid him in advance , and arranged to receive the girl into his house three days from the dateof purchase , the third day being a lucky day ."
这 拐子 又 悄悄的 卖与 了 薛家 ， 被 我们 知道 了 ， 去 找 拿 卖主 ， 夺取 丫头 。,"The kidnapper , having already pocketed my young master 's money , then quietly went off and sold her again to Xue . When we found this out , we went along to seize him and to collect the girl ."
无奈 薛家原 系 金陵 一霸 ， 倚财仗势 ， 众 豪 奴 将 我 小 主人 竟 打死 了 。,"' But unfortunately this Xue turned out to be a powerful Nanking boss , who evidently thought that by money and influence he could get away with anything . He set a crowd of his henchmen on to my young master and beat him up so badly that he died ."
凶 身 主仆 已 皆 逃走 ， 无有 踪迹 ， 只 剩 了 几个 局外 的 人 。,"' Xue and his henchmen have now disappeared without trace , leaving only a few retainers who were not involved in the crime ."
小人 告 了 一年 的 状 ， 竟 无人 作主 ；,"But though it is a year since I first brought this charge , no one has yet done anything to help me ."
求 太老爷 拘拿 凶犯 ， 以 扶 善良 ， 存 殁 感激 大恩 不尽 ！ ”,I beseech Your Honour to arrest the criminals and to uphold the course of justice ! Both the living and the dead will be everlastingly grateful to you if you do ! '
雨村 听 了 大 怒 道 ： “ 那 有 这 等 事 ！,' This is monstrous ! ' said Yu-cun in a towering rage .
打死 人 竟 白白的 走 了 拿 不来 的 ！ ”,Am I to understand that a man can be beaten to death and the murderer walk off scot-free with nobody lifting a finger to arrest him ? '
便 发签 差 公人 立刻 将 凶犯 家属 拿来 拷问 。 只见 案 旁站 着 一个 门子 ， 使眼色 不 叫 他 发签 。,"and he took up a warrant and was on the point of sending his runners to seize the murderer 's dependants and bring them to court so that they might be put to the torture , when he observed one of the ushers signalling to him with his eyes not to issue the warrant ."
雨村 心下 狐疑 ， 只得 停 了 手 。 退堂 至 密室 ， 令 从 人 退去 ， 只 留 这 门子 一 人 伏侍 ；,"His resolution somewhat shaken , he put it down again and adjourned to his private chambers , dismissing everyone except the usher , whom he ordered to remain behind in attendance ."
门子 忙 上前 请安 ， 笑 问 ：,"When they were alone together the usher , with a broad smile on his face , came forward and touched his hand and knee to the ground in the Manchu salute ."
“ 老爷 一向 加官进禄 ， 八九年 来 ， 就 忘 了 我 了 ？ ”,' Your Honour has gone a long way up in the world during these past eight or nine years ! I do not expect you would remember me ! '
雨村 道 ： “ 我 看 你 十分 眼熟 ， 但 一时 总 想不起来 。 ”,"' Your face is certainly familiar , ' said Yu-cun , but for the moment I simply can not place"
门子 笑 道 ： “ 老爷 怎么 把 出身 之地 竟 忘 了 ！,The usher smiled again . ' Has Your Honour forgotten the place you started from ?
老爷 不 记得 当年 葫芦 庙里 的 事 么 ？ ”,Do you remember nothing of the old times in Bottle-gourd Temple ? '
雨村 大 惊 ， 方 想起 往事 。,"With a start of recognition , Yu-cun remembered ."
原来 这 门子 本 是 葫芦 庙里 一个 小沙弥 ， 因 被 火 之后 ， 无处 安身 ， 想 这件 生意 倒 还 轻 省 ， 耐 不得 寺院 凄凉 ， 遂 趁 年纪 轻 ， 蓄 了 发 ， 充当 门子 。,"The usher had been a little novice in the temple where he once lodged . Finding himself homeless after the fire , and bethinking himself that a post in a yamen was a fine , gentlemanly way of earning a living , and being furthermore heartily sick of the rigours of monastic life , the little novice had taken advantage of his youth to grow his hair again and get himself a post as an usher ."
雨村 那里 想 得 是 他 ？,Small wonder that Yu-cun had failed to recognize him !
便 忙 携手 笑 道 ： “ 原来 还是 故人 。 ” 因 赏 他 坐 了 说话 。,"' Ah , so it was an old acquaintance ! ' said Yu-cun , grasping him warmly by the hand and urging him to sit down for a chat ."
这 门子 不敢 坐 ， 雨村 笑 道 ： “ 你 也 算 贫贱之交 了 ， 此 系 私室 ， 但 坐 不妨 。 ”,"But the usher would not be seated . ' Come , ' said Yu-cun , ' as a friend of my early , hard-up days you are entitled to . After all , this is a private room . Why not ? '"
门子 才 斜 签着 坐下 。,The usher permitted himself to perch one of his haunches sideways on the edge of a chair .
雨村 道 ： “ 方才 何故 不令 发签 ？ ”,"' Tell me , ' said Yu-cun , ' why did you stop me issuing that warrant just now ? '"
门子 道 ： “ 老爷 荣任 到 此 ， 难道 就 没抄 一张 本省 的 ‘ 护官 符 ’ 来 不成 ？ ”,' Your Honour is new to this post . Surely you must have provided yourself before you left with a copy of the Mandarin 's Life-Preserver for this province ? '
雨村 忙 问 ： “ 何为 ‘ 护官 符 ’ ？ ”,' What is the Mandarin 's Life-Preserver ? ' Yu-cun inquired curiously .
门子 道 ： “ 如今 凡 作 地方官 的 都 有 一个 私单 ， 上面 写 的 是 本省 最 有 权势 极 富贵 的 大 乡绅 名姓 ， 各省 皆然 ； 倘若 不知 ， 一时 触犯 了 这样 的 人家 ， 不但 官爵 ， 只怕 连 性命 也 难保 呢 ！,"' Nowadays every provincial official carries a private hand-list with the names of all the richest , most influential people in his area . There is one for every province . They list those families which are so powerful that if you were ever to run up against one of them unknowingly , not only your job , but perhaps even your life might be in danger ."
— — 所以 叫做 ‘ 护官 符 ’ 。,"That is why they are called "" life-preservers "" ."
方才 所说 的 这 薛家 ， 老爷 如何 惹 得 他 ！,' Now take this Xue you were dealing with just now . Your Honour could not possibly try conclusions with Aim !
他 这件 官司 并 无难断 之 处 ， 从前 的 官府 ， 都 因 碍 着 情分 脸面 ， 所以 如此 。 ”,Why do you suppose this case has remained unsettled for so long ? It is a straightforward enough case . The reason is simply that none of your predecessors dared touch it because of the unpleasantness and loss of face it would have caused them . '
一面 说 ， 一面 从顺 袋中 取出 一张 抄 的 “ 护官 符 ” 来 ， 递 与 雨村 ， 看 时 ， 上面 皆 是 本地 大族 名 宦之家 的 俗谚口碑 ， 云 ：,While he was speaking he had been fishing for a copy of the Mandarin 's Life-Preserver in his pocket . This he now presented fo Yu-cun for his inspection . It contained a set of doggerel verses in which were listed the big families and most powerful magnates of the area in which he was working . It went something like this :
贾 不 假 ，,Shout hip hurrah For the Nanking Jia !
白玉 为 堂金 作马 。,They weigh their gold out By the jar .
阿房 官 ，,The Ah-bang Palace
三百里 ，,"Scrapes the sky ,"
住 不下 金陵 一个 史 。,But it could not house The Nanking Shi .
东海 缺少 白玉 床 ，,"The King of the Ocean Goes along ,"
龙王 来 请 金陵 王 。,"When he is short of gold beds , To the Nanking Wang ."
丰年 好 大 “ 雪 ” ，,"The Nanking Xue So rich are they ,"
珍珠 如 土金 如 铁 。,To count their money Would take all day . . .
雨村 尚末 看完 ， 忽闻 传点 ， 报 “ 王老爷 来 拜 ” 。,"Before Yu-cun had time to read further , a warning chime from the inner gate and a shout outside the door announced the arrival of a Mr Wang on an official call ."
雨村 忙 具 衣冠 接迎 。,Yu-cun hastily donned the hat and robe of office which he had temporarily laid aside and went out to meet the visitor .
有 顿饭 工夫 方 回来 ， 问 这 门子 ， 门子 道 ：,About the length of time it would take to eat a meal elapsed before he returned and resumed his conversation with the usher .
“ 四家 皆 连络 有 亲 ， 一损俱损 ， 一荣俱荣 ， 今 告 打死 人 之 薛 ， 就是 ‘ 丰年 大雪 ’ 之 ‘ 薛 ’ ， — — 不单 靠 这三家 ， 他 的 世交 亲友 在 都 在外 的 本 也 不少 ， 老爷 如今 拿 谁 去 ？ ”,"' Those four families , ' said the usher in answer to a question from Yu-cun , ' are all closely connected with each other . A loss for one is a loss for all . A gain for one is a gain for all . The Xue who has been charged with the manslaughter is one of the "" Nanking Xue so rich are they "" . Not only can he count on the support of the other three Nanking families , he also has any number of family friends and connections of his own both at the capital and in the provinces . Now who are you going to arrest ? '"
雨村 听说 ， 便 笑 问 门子 道 ：,"' That is all very well , ' said Yu-cun with an uneasy laugh , ' but how am I going to settle this case ?"
“ 这样 说来 ， 却 怎么 了结 此案 ？,"Incidentally , I assume you know perfectly well where the criminal is hiding ? '"
— — 你 大约 也 深知 这 凶犯 躲 的 方向 了 ？ ”,"' I would not deceive Your Honour , ' replied the usher with a grin , ' not only do I know where the criminal has gone but I also know who the kidnapper is and all about the poor devil who was killed ."
门子 笑 道 ：,Let me tell you the whole story .
“ 不 瞒 老爷 说 ， 不但 这 凶犯 躲 的 方向 ， 并 这 拐 的 人 我 也 知道 ， 死鬼 买主 也 深 知道 ， 待 我 细说 与 老爷 听 ：,' The man who was killed was a poor country squire 's son called Feng Yuan .
这个 被 打死 的 是 一个 小 乡宦 之 子 ， 名唤 冯渊 ， 父母 俱 亡 ， 又 无 兄弟 ， 守 着 些 薄产 度日 ；,His father and mother were both dead and he had no brothers . He lived off the income of a very small estate .
年纪 十八九岁 ， 酷爱 男风 ， 不好 女色 。,He was eighteen or nineteen when he died . He was a confirmed queer and not interested in girls .
这 也 是 前生 冤孽 ： 可巧 遇见 这 丫头 ， 他 便 一眼 看上 了 ， 立意 买来 作妾 ， 设誓 不近 男色 ， 也 不再 娶 第二个 了 ， 所以 郑重其事 ， 必 得 三日 后方 进门 。,"Which shows that the whole business must have been fated , because no sooner did he set eyes on this girl than he at once fell in love with her - swore he would never have anything more to do with boys and never have any other woman but her . That was the idea of this waiting three days before she came to him . To make it seem more like a wedding and less like a sale ."
谁知 这 拐子 又 偷卖 与 薛家 ， — — 他 意欲 卷 了 两家 的 银子 逃 去 ， 谁知 又 走 不脱 ， 两家 拿 住 ， 打了个 半死 ， 都 不肯 收银 ， 各 要领 人 。,"' What he could not foresee , of course , was that the kidnapper would use this interval to resell her on the sly to Xue , hoping to pocket the money from both parties and then do a flit . Only he did not get away with it . The two parties nabbed him before he could disappear and beat the daylights out of him . Both refused to take back their money , and both insisted that they wanted the girl ."
那 薛公子 便 喝令 下 人 动手 ， 将 冯公子 打了个 稀烂 ， 抬回去 三日 竟 死 了 。,It was at this point that our young friend Xue called for his roughs to get to work on Feng Yuan . They beat him till he was hardly recognizable . Then they picked him up and carried him home . He died three days later .
这 薛公子 原择 下 日子 要 上京 的 ， 既 打 了 人 ， 夺 了 丫头 ， 他 便 没事人 一般 ， 只管 带 了 家眷 走 他 的 路 ， 并非 为此 而 逃 ；,"' Now long before any of this happened , young Xue had made arrangements for a Journey to the capital . So after killing Feng and carrying off the girl , he set off with his family , calm as you please , on the appointed day . There was no question of his running away because of the killing ."
这 人命 些 些 小事 ， 自有 他 弟兄 奴仆 在 此 料理 。,In his eyes a trifling matter like taking another man 's life was something for his junior clansmen or the servants to clear up in his absence .
— — 这 且 别说 ， 老爷 可知 这 被 卖 的 丫头 是 谁 ？ ”,' But never mind him . Who do you think the slave-girl is ? '
雨村 道 ： “ 我 如何 晓得 ？ ”,' How in the world should I know ? ' said Yu-cun .
门子 冷笑 道 ：,"The usher smiled maliciously . ' You ought to , Your Honour !"
“ 这 人 还是 老爷 的 大 恩人 呢 ！ 他 就是 葫芦 庙 旁 住 的 甄老爷 的 女儿 ， 小名 英莲 的 。 ”,"She is your great benefactress - Ying-lian , the little daughter of Mr Zhen , who used to live next door to Bottle-gourd Temple . '"
雨村 骇然 道 ： “ 原来 是 他 ！ 听见 他 自 五岁 被 人 拐 去 ， 怎么 如今 才 卖 呢 ？ ”,' Good gracious ! ' said Yu-cun in astonishment . ' I had heard that she was kidnapped at the age of five . But how did she come to be sold so long after the kidnapping ? '
门子 道 ： “ 这种 拐子 单 拐 幼女 ， 养至 十二三岁 ， 带 至 他 乡 转卖 。,' This type of kidnapper specializes in kidnapping very young girls and rearing them until they are twelve or thirteen for sale in other parts of the country .
当日 这 英莲 ， 我们 天天 哄 他 玩耍 ， 极 相熟 的 ， 所以 隔 了 七八年 ， 虽 模样儿 出脱 的 齐整 ， 然 大段 未改 ， 所以 认得 ， — — 且 他 眉心 中原 有 米粒 大 的 一点 胭脂 用 ， 从 胎 里 带来 的 。,"When she was little we used to play with Ying-lian at the temple nearly every day , so I knew her very well ; and when I saw her again , even though it was after an interval of seven or eight years , I could tell it was her . Shed grown into a little woman in the meantime , but her features were still the same ; and to confirm it there was a tiny red birthmark right in the middle of her brow which I remembered ."
偏 这 拐子 又 租 了 我 的 房子 居住 ， 那日 拐子 不 在家 ， 我 也 曾 问 他 ， 他 说 是 打怕 了 的 ， 万 不敢 说 ， 只 说 拐子 是 他 的 亲爹 ， 因 无钱 还债 才 卖 的 。,"' By a strange coincidence the kidnapper had rented one of my rooms , and one day when he was out I put it to her who she was . But she said she was scared of being beaten and nothing would induce her to talk . She just kept insisting that the kidnapper was her real father , selling her because he had no money to pay his debts with ."
再 四 哄 他 ， 他 又 哭 了 ， 只 说 ：,"I kept on at her , cajoling and persuading , and in the end she broke down and cried ."
‘ 我 原不 记得 小时 的 事 ！ ’,Said she did not remember anything about her childhood .
这 无 可疑 了 。,"But there is no doubt in my mind . It is her , all right ."
那日 冯公子 相见 了 ， 兑 了 银子 ， 因 拐子 醉 了 ， 英莲 自叹 说 ： ‘ 我 今日 罪孽 可满 了 ！ ’,"' The day young Feng met her and paid out the money for her , the kidnapper got drunk , and she opened up to me a bit . She was feeling very relieved . She said , ' Today I think my tribulations are at last coming to an end . '"
后 又 听见 三日 后才 过门 ， 他 又 转有 忧愁 之 态 。,"But then later , when she heard that she was not to be installed until after another three days , she began to look worried and despondent again ."
我 又 不忍 ， 等 拐子 出去 ， 又 叫 内 人 去 解劝 他 ：,"I felt truly sorry for her , and sent the wife round to have a talk with her while the kidnapper was out and give her a bit of encouragement ."
‘ 这 冯公子 必待好 日期 来 接 ， 可知 必不 以 丫鬟 相看 。,"' The wife said to her , "" Mr Feng 's insistence on waiting three days before taking you in shows that he does not intend to treat you like a servant ."
况 他 是 个 绝 风流 人品 ， 家里 颇 过 得 ， 素性 又 最 厌恶 堂客 ， 今 竟 破价 买 你 ， 后事 不 言 可知 。,"Besides , "" she said , "" he is a very nice , handsome gentleman , and quite comfortably off . Normally he does not like the fair sex , yet here he is spending everything he has on your purchase . You can tell from that , "" she said , "" how much he must care for you ."
只 耐得 三两日 ， 何必 忧闷 ？ ’,"You only have to be patient for another day or two , "" she said . ' You have no cause to be downcast . """
他 听 如此 说 ， 方略 解 些 ； 自谓 从此 得所 。,"' Well , that seemed to cheer her up a bit , and she began to feel that life was going to be worth living ."
谁料 天下 竟 有 不如意 事 ， 第二日 ， 他 偏 又 卖 与 了 薛家 ！,"' But only the day after that , by the most accursed stroke of bad luck which no one could possibly have foreseen , she was sold to Xue ."
若 卖 与 第二家 还好 ， 这 薛公子 的 混名 ， 人称 他 ‘ 呆 霸王 ’ ， 最 是 天下第一 个 弄性尚气 的 人 ， 而且 使 钱 如 土 ， 只 打了个 落花流水 ， 生拖死拽 ， 把 个 英 莲 拖去 ， 如今 也 不知死活 。,"Now if it had been anyone else , it would not have mattered so much , but this young Xue , whose nickname is the Oaf King , is the world 's most bad-tempered bully ; and having spent money like water on buying the girl only to find that she was not willing , he knocked her about until she was half unconscious and dragged her of with him more dead than alive . Whether she is alive or dead now I have no idea ."
这 冯公子 空喜 一场 ， 一 念 未遂 ， 反花 了 钱 ， 送 了 命 ， 岂 不可 叹 ！ ”,"' And young Feng is really to be pitied ! After a brief moment of happiness , before anything had come his way he spent all his money and laid down his life for nothing !"
雨村 听 了 也 叹 道 ：,Yu-cun sighed sympathetically .
“ 这 也 是 他们 的 孽障 遭遇 ， 亦非 偶然 ， 不然 这 冯渊 如何 偏 只 看上 了 这 英莲 ？,"' Their meeting can not have been coincidental . It must have been the working out of some destiny . An atonement . Otherwise , how is one to account for Feng Yuan 's sudden affection for that particular girl ?"
这 英莲 受 了 拐子 这 几年 折磨 ， 才 得 了 个 路 头 ， 且 又 是 个 多情 的 ， 若果 聚合 了 ， 倒 是 件 美事 ； 偏 又 生出 这 段 事 来 ！,"' And Ying-lian , after all those years of ill-treatment at the hands of her kidnapper , suddenly seeing a road to freedom opening in front of her - for she was a girl of feeling , and there is no doubt that they would have made a fine couple if they had succeeded in coming together - and then for this to have happened !"
这 薛家纵 比 冯家 富贵 ， 想 其 为 人 ， 自然 姬 妾 众多 ， 淫佚 无度 ， 未必 及 冯渊 定情 于 一 人 ：,"' And even though Xue may be far wealthier and better-placed than Feng was , a man like that is sure to have numbers of concubines and paramours and to be licentious and debauched in his habits - quite incapable of concentrating all his affections on one girl as Feng Yuan would have done ."
这 正是 梦幻 情缘 ， 恰 遇见 一对 薄命 儿女 。,' A real case of an ideal romance on the one hand and a pair of unlucky young things on the other adding up to make a tragedy !
— — 且 不要 议论 他人 ， 只 目今 这 官司 如何 剖断 才 好 ？ ”,' But a truce to this discussion of other people 's affairs ! Let us rather consider how this case is to be settled ! '
门子 笑 道 : “ 老爷 当年 何其 明决 ， 今日 何 反成 个 没主意 的 人 了 ！,"' Your Honour used to be decisive enough in the old days , ' said the usher with a smile . ' What has become of your old resolution today ?"
小 的 听见 老爷 补升 此 任 ， 系 贾府 王府 之 力 ； 此 薛蟠 即 贾府之 亲 ：,"Now , I was told that your promotion to this post was due to the combined influence of the Jias and the Wangs ; and this Xue Pan is related to the Jias by marriage ."
老爷 何不 顺水行舟 ， 做 个人 情 ， 将 此案 了结 ， 日后 也好 去 见 贾 王二公 。 ”,Why not trim your sails to the wind in your handling of this case ? Why not make a virtue of necessity by doing them a favour which will stand you in good stead next time you see them ? '
雨村 道 ： “ 你 说 的 何尝 不是 。,"' What you say is , of course , entirely correct , ' said Yu-cun ."
但 事关 人命 ， 蒙 皇上 隆恩 起 复 委用 ， 正 竭力 图报 之 时 ， 岂可 因私 枉法 ， 是 实 不忍 为 的 。 ”,"' But there is , after all , a human life involved in this case ; and you have to remember that I have only just been restored to office by an act of Imperial clemency . I really can not bring myself to pervert Justice for private ends at the very moment when I ought to be doing my utmost to show my gratitude . '"
门子 听 了 冷笑 道 ： “ 老爷 说 的 自是 正理 ， 但 如今 世上 是行 不去 的 ！,"The usher smiled coldly . ' What Your Honour says is no doubt very right and proper , but it will not wash . Not the way things are in the world today !"
岂不闻 古人 说 的 ‘ 大丈夫 相时而动 ’ ， 又 说 ‘ 趋吉避凶 者 为 君子 ’ ， 依 老爷 这话 ， 不但 不能 报效 朝廷 ， 亦且 自身 不 保 ：,"Haven ' t you heard the old saying "" The man of spirit shapes his actions to the passing moment "" ? And there is another old saying : "" It is the mark of a gentleman to avoid what is inauspicious "" . If you were to act in accordance with what you have just said , not only would you pot be able to show your gratitude to the Emperor , but also you would probably put your own life in danger ."
还要 三思 为 妥 。 ”,"If I were you , I should think very carefully before you do anything . '"
雨村 低 了 头 ， 半日 说道 ： “ 依 你 怎么着 ？ ”,"Yu-cun lowered his head in thought . After a very long pause he asked , ' What do you think I ought to do ? '"
门子 道 ： “ 小人 已 想了个 很好 的 主意 在 此 ：,"' I have thought of a very good solution , ' said the usher ."
老爷 明日 坐堂 ， 只管 虚张声势 ， 动 文书 ， 发签 拿 人 ， — — 凶犯 自然 是 拿 不来 的 ， 原告 固是 不依 ， 只用 将 薛 家族 人 及 奴仆 人 等 拿 几个 来 拷问 ， 小 的 在 暗中 调停 ， 令 他们 报 个 ‘ 暴病 身亡 ’ ， 合族 中 及 地方 上共递 一张 保 呈 ， 老爷 只说 善能 扶鸾 请 仙 ， 堂上 设 了 乩 坛 ， 令 军民 人 等 只管 来看 ， 老爷 便 说 ：,"' When you open court tomorrow , you should make a great display of authority . Send out writs , issue warrants for arrest , and so forth . You will not , of course , be able to arrest the culprits , and the plaintiffs will certainly not allow the matter to rest there ; so what you do then is to arrest some of Xue 's clansmen and servants for questioning . But in the meantime I shall have got to work on them on the side and arranged for them to report that Xue has died of sudden illness . This can be supported by the affidavits of the whole Xue clan and the people living in the neighbourhood . ' Then Your Honour has it put about that you have a gift for the planchette . You have an altar set up in the court and a planchette board installed on it and you issue an open invitation to any members of the public who want to to attend a séance . Then you say ,"
‘ 乩 仙 批 了 ， 死者 冯渊 与 薛蟠 原系 夙孽 ， 今 狭路相遇 ， 原因 了结 。,""" The spirit control gives judgment as follows : ' The dead man , Feng Yuan , owed a debt of karma to Xue Pan from a former life and ' meeting his enemy in a narrow way ' , paid for it with his life ."
今 薛蟠 已 得 了 无名 之病 ， 被 冯渊 的 魂魄 追索 而 死 。,"The sudden , unexplained illness which struck down Xue Pan was caused by the vengeful ghost of Feng Yuan come to claim its own ."
其 祸 皆 由 拐子 而 起 ， 除 将 拐子 按 法 处治 外 ， 余 不 累及 … … ’ 等 语 。,"Since the tragedy was entirely due to the behaviour of the kidnapper , the kidnapper should be dealt with according to the full rigour of the law ; but apart from him , all other parties are exonerated . . . "" and so on and so forth ."
小人 暗中 嘱咐 拐子 ， 令 其实 招 ； 众人 见 乩 仙 批语 与 拐子 相符 ， 自然 不疑 了 。,"' I shall secretly instruct the kidnapper to make a full confession , and when the public see that the judgment given by the planchette tallies with the confession made by the kidnapper , they will naturally have no suspicions ."
薛家 有的是 钱 ， 老爷 断 一千 也 可 ， 五百 也 可 ， 与 冯家作 烧埋 之 费 ， 那 冯家 也 无 甚 要紧 的 人 ， 不过 为的是 钱 ， 有 了 银子 ， 也 就 无话 了 。,"' Then you award the Fengs compensation to cover funeral expenses and so on . And since the Xues are rolling in money , you can say anything you like . Five hundred , a thousand - it does not matter . There is no one of any importance on the Feng side , and in any case they are mainly in this for the money . So once they have got their compensation , they should not give you any further trouble ."
— — 老爷 细 想 ， 此 计 如何 ？ ”,"' What about that tor a plan , Your Honour ? You just think it over ! '"
雨村 笑 道 ： “ 不妥 ， 不妥 。,Yu-cun laughed . ' Too risky !
等 我 再 斟酌 斟酌 ， 压服 得 口声 才 好 。 ”,Let me turn it over in my mind a little longer . The main thing is to think of something that will stop people talking . '
二人 计议 已 定 。,And with this observation the two men concluded their discussion .
至 次日 坐堂 ， 勾取 一 干 有名 人犯 ， 雨村 详加 审问 ， 果 见 冯家 人口 稀少 ， 不过 赖 此 欲 得 些 烧埋 之 银 ； 薛家 仗势 倚 情 ， 偏 不 相让 ， 故致 颠倒 未决 。,"At next day 's session a group of well-known associates of the wanted man were brought in and subjected by Yu-cun to careful questioning . It emerged , as the usher had said , that the Fengs were tew in number and had brought this action solely in the hope of gaining some compensation , and that it was only because the Xues had , with the arrogance of the very rich and very powerful , refused to pay a penny , that the case had been brought to a standstill ."
雨村 便 徇情枉法 ， 胡乱 判断 了 此案 ， 冯家得 了 许多 烧埋 银子 ， 也 就 无 甚 话 说 了 。,"By a judicious bending of the law to suit the circumstances , Yu-cun managed to arrive at some sort of judgment whereby the plaintiffs received substantial compensation and went off tolerably well satisfied ."
雨村 便 疾忙 修书 二封 与 贾政 并 京营 节度使 王子腾 ， 不过 说 “ 令甥 之事 已 完 ， 不必 过虑 ” 之言 寄去 。,"He then hurriedly drafted and sent off two letters , one to Jia Zheng and one to Wang Zi-teng , Commandant , Metropolitan Barracks , in which he merely stated that their ' nephew 's affair had been settled and there was no further cause for concern ' ."
此事 皆 由 葫芦 庙 内 沙弥 新 门子 所为 ， 雨村 又 恐 他 对 人 说出 当日 贫贱 时事 来 ， 因此 心中 大 不乐意 ；,"Fearful that the now usher and quondam novice of Bottle-gourd Temple might talk to others about the days when he was an obscure and impoverished student , Yu-cun for some time went about in great discomfort of mind ."
后来 到底 寻 了 他 一个 不是 ， 远远 的 充发 了 才 罢 。,"Finally , however , he managed to catch him out in some misdemeanour or other and have him drafted for military service on a frontier outpost , after which he felt able to breathe freely again ."
当下 言 不着 雨村 。,But now no more of Yu-cun .
且说 那 买 了 英莲 、 打死 冯渊 的 那 薛公子 ， 亦 系 金陵 人氏 ， 本 是 书香 继世 之家 ， 只是 如今 这 薛公子 幼年 丧父 ， 寡母 又 怜 他 是 个 独根孤种 ， 未免 溺爱 纵容 些 ， 遂 致 老大无成 ；,"Let us turn instead to Young Xue , the man who purchased Ying-lian and had Feng Yuan beaten to death . He was a native of Nanking and came of a refined and highly cultivated family , but having lost his father in infancy and been , as sole remaining scion of the stock , excessively indulged by a doting widowed mother , he had grown up into a useless lout ."
且 家中 有 百万 之富 ， 现 领 着 内 帑 钱粮 ， 采办 杂料 。,The family was immensely wealthy . As one of the official Court Purveyors they received money from the Privy Purse with which to make purchases for the Imperial Household .
这 薛公子 学名 薛蟠 ， 表字 文起 ， 性情 奢侈 ， 言语 傲慢 ；,"Xue Pan , to give him his full name , was a naturally extravagant young man with an insolent turn of speech ."
虽 也 上过 学 ， 不过 略识 几个 字 ， 终日 惟有 斗鸡走马 ， 游山玩景 而已 ；,"He had been educated after a fashion , but could barely read and write . He devoted the greater part of his time to cock-fighting , horse-racing , and outings to places of scenic interest ."
虽是 皇商 ， 一应 经纪 世事 ， 全然不知 ， 不过 赖 祖父 旧日 的 情分 ， 户部 挂 个 虚名 ， 支领 钱粮 ， 其余 事体 ， 自有 伙计 老家人 等 措办 。,"Though an Imperial Purveyor , he was wholly innocent of business skill and savoir-faire ; and though , for his father 's and grandfather 's sake , he was allowed to register at the Ministry and receive regular payments of grain and money , everything else was looked after for him by the clerks and factors of the family business ."
寡母 王氏乃 现 任京营 节度使 王子腾 之 妹 ， 与 荣国府 贾政 的 夫人 王氏 是 一 母所生 的 姊妹 ， 今年 方 五十 上下 ， 只有 薛蟠 一子 。,"Xue Pan 's widowed mother was a younger half-sister of Wang Zi-teng , at that time Commandant of the Metropolitan Barracks , and younger sister of Lady Wang , the wife of Jia Zheng of the Rong mansion . She was now around fifty and had only the one son ."
还有 一 女 ， 比 薛蟠 小 两岁 ， 乳名 宝钗 ， 生 得 肌骨 莹润 ， 举止娴雅 ， 当时 他 父亲 在 日 ， 极 爱 此 女 ， 令 其 读书 识字 ， 较之 乃兄 ， 竟 高 十倍 ；,"Besides Xue Pan she had a daughter two years his junior called Bao-chai , a girl of flawless looks and great natural refinement . While her father was still alive she had been his favourite and had been taught to read and write and construe - all of which she did ten times better than her oafish brother ;"
自 父亲 死 后 ， 见 哥哥 不能 安慰 母心 ， 他 便 不以 书字 为念 ， 只 留心 针黹 家计 等 事 ， 好 为 母亲 分忧 代劳 。,"but when he died and her brother proved incapable of offering their mother any comfort , she laid aside her books and devoted herself to needlework and housewifely duties in order to take some of the burden off her mother 's shoulders ."
近因 今上 崇尚 诗礼 ， 征采 才能 ， 降 不世之 隆恩 ， 除 聘选 妃嫔 夕卜 ， 在世 宦 名家 之 女 ， 皆 得 亲名 达 部 ， 以备 选择 ， 为 宫主 郡主 人学 陪侍 ， 充为 才 人 赞善 之 职 。,"The well-known interest always shown by our present sovereign in literature and the arts , and the widespread recruitment of talent that this has stimulated , had recently , at the time of which we speak , led to an unprecedented act of Imperial grace whereby daughters of hereditary officials and distinguished families , apart from the possibility of being recruited to the Imperial seraglio by the customary procedures , were permitted to have their names sent in to the Ministry for selection as study-companions , with the rank and title of Maid of Honour or Lady-in-waiting , of the Imperial princesses and the daughters of princes of the blood ."
自 薛蟠 父亲 死 后 ， 各省 中 所有 的 卖买 承局 、 总管 、 伙计 人 等 ， 见 薛蟠 年轻 不诸 世事 ， 便 趁时 拐骗 起来 ， 京都 几处 生意 ， 渐 亦 销耗 。 薛蟠素 闻 得 都 中 乃 第一 繁华 之 地 ， 正思 一 游 ， 便 趁此机会 ， 一来 送 妹 待 选 ， 二来 望亲 ， 三来 亲自 入 部销 算旧账 ， 再计新 支 ，,"This circumstance , coupled with the fact that , since the death of his father , the managers , clerks , and factors of the family business in its various agencies throughout the provinces had profited from Xue Pan 's youth and ignorance of affairs to feather their own nests at the firm 's expense , and even the family 's enterprises in the capital , of which there were several , had shown a gradual falling-off , provided Xue Pan , who had long heard of the rich pleasures of the metropolis and was agog to taste them , with excuses for realizing his cherished ambition , viz : 1 . They must go to the capital because he had to present his sister to the Ministry for selection . 2 . They must go to the capital to look up their kinsfolk there . 3 . They must go to the capital so that he might clear his accounts with the Ministry and take receipt of a new instalment of funds ."
— — 其实 只 为 游览 上 国 风光 之 意 ， 因此 早已 检点 下 行装 细软 ， 以及 馈送 亲友 各色 土物 人情 等 类 ， 正 择日 起身 ， 不想 偏 遇 着 那 拐子 ， 买 了 英莲 。 薛蟠见 英莲生 的 不俗 ， 立意 买 了 作妾 ， 又 遇 冯家来 夺 ， 因 恃 强 喝令 豪奴 将 冯渊 打死 ， 便 将 家中 事务 ， 一一 嘱托 了 族 中 人 并 几个 老家人 ， 自己 同着 母亲 妹子 ， 竟自 起身 长行 去 了 ， 人命官司 ， 他 却 视为儿戏 ， 自谓 花 上 几个 钱 ， 没有 不了 的 。,"( Needless to say , the sole substantial reason for going to the capital , Xue Pan 's desire to see the sights , was unexpressed . ) Accordingly , their baggage had long been packed and souvenirs of Nanking for their friends and relations in the capital long been selected and a date for their departure long been decided on , when Xue Pan encountered the kidnapper and Ying-lian and , as Ying-lian was an uncommonly attractive slave-girl , resolved to purchase her and make her his concubine . Then Feng and his servants came to seize the girl and Xue Pan , confident in his superior forces , shouted the command to his attendant roughs which was to have such fatal consequences for poor Feng Yuan . Entrusting everything to his clansmen and a few old and trusty retainers , he then proceeded to depart according to schedule , in company with his mother and sister , on the long journey to the capital , accounting the charge of manslaughter a mere bagatelle which the expenditure of a certain amount of coin could confidently be expected to resolve ."
在 路 不 记 其日 。 那日 已 将 人 都 ， 又 听见 母舅 王子腾 升 了 九省 统制 ， 奉旨 出 都 查 边 ， 薛蟠 心中 暗喜 道 ： “ 我 正愁 进京 去 有 舅舅 管辖 ， 不能 任意 挥霍 ， 如今 升 出去 ， 可知 天从人愿 ！ ”,"Of the journey our story gives no record , except to say that on the last day when they were about to enter the capital , they heard news that Xue Pan 's uncle Wang Zi-teng had just been promoted C . - in-C. Northern Provinces with instructions to leave the capital on a tour of frontier inspection . The news secretly delighted Xue Pan . ' Just as I was worrying about Uncle cramping my style when we got to the capital and preventing me from having a really good fling , ' he reflected , ' the old boy obligingly gets himself popped out of the way . Fortune is on my side !"
因 和 母亲 商议 道 ：,He then proceeded to reason as follows with his mother :
“ 咱们 京 中 虽有 几处 房舍 ， 只是 这 十来年 没人 居住 ， 那 看守 的 人 ， 未免 偷 着 租赁 给 人 住 ， 须得先 着 人 去 打扫 收拾 才 好 。 ”,"' We have got several houses in the capital , but its all of ten years since anyone has been to stay in them , so you can bet that the housekeepers will have let all the rooms out on the sly . We shall have to send someone on ahead to get things straightened out for us ."
他 母亲 道 ： “ 何必如此 招摇 ！,' Whyever should we go to any such trouble ? ' said his mother .
咱们 这 进京 去 ， 原是 先 拜望 亲友 ， 或是 在 你 舅舅 处 ， 或是 你 姨父 家 ， 他 两家 的 房舍 极 是 宽敞 的 ， 咱们 且 住 下 再 慢慢儿 的 着 人 去 收拾 ， 岂 不 消停 些 ？ ”,' I thought the main purpose of our coming here in the first place was to see our relations . There must be lots and lots of spare room at your Uncle Wang 's and at your Uncle Jia is place . Surely it would be much more sensible to stay with one of them first ? There will be plenty of time to send our people to get a place of our own ready after we are there . '
薛蟠 道 ： “ 如今 舅舅 正升 了 外省 去 ， 家里 自然 忙乱 起身 ， 咱们 这 会子 反一窝 一拖 的 奔 了 去 ， 岂 不 没 眼色 呢 ？ ”,"' But Uncle 's just been promoted to the Northern Provinces , ' Xue Pan expostulated . ' They will all be making frantic preparations for him to go . What sort of stupid idiots shall we look like if we come scooting along with all our bag and baggage just at the very moment when he wants to leave ? '"
他 母亲 道 ： “ 你 舅舅 虽 升 了 去 ， 还有 你 姨父 家 。,"' Suppose your Uncle Wang has been promoted to another place , ' said his mother . ' There is still your Uncle Jia ."
况 这几年来 ， 你 舅舅 姨娘 两处 每每 带信 捎 书 接 咱们 来 。,"Besides , Uncle Wang and Auntie Jia have for years been sending us letters inviting us to come and stay with them ."
如今 既 来 了 ， 你 舅舅 虽 忙 着 起身 ， 你 贾家 的 姨娘 未必 不 苦留 我们 。,"Now that we are here , even though Uncle Wang is busy getting ready to go , Auntie Jia will probably be only too glad to have us ."
咱们 且 忙忙 的 收拾 房子 ， 岂 不 使 人 见怪 ？,I am sure she would be most offended if we were to go rushing of to get our own house ready .
你 的 意思 我 早 知道 了 ：,' But I know perfectly well what is in your mind .
守 着 舅舅 姨母 住 着 ， 未免 拘紧 了 ， 不如 各自 住 着 ， 好 任意 施 为 。,"You think that if we are staying with your uncle or aunt you will be too restricted , and that if we were living in our own place you would be freer to do just as you liked ."
你 既 如此 ， 你 自去 挑所 宅子 去 住 ， 我 和 你 姨娘 姊妹 们 别 了 这 几年 ， 却 要 住 几日 ， 我 带 了 你 妹子 去 投 你 姨娘 家 去 ， 你 道 好不好 ？ ”,"Very well then . Why do not you go off and choose a house for yourself to live in and let me and your sister go to Auntie 's without you ? I haven ' t seen her or the girls for years and years , and I intend to spend a few days with them now we are here . '"
薛蟠见 母亲 如此 说 ， 情知 扭 不过 ， 只得 吩咐 人夫 ， 一路 奔 荣国府 而 来 。,"Experience taught Xue Pan that his mother was in an obstinate mood and not to be shaken from her purpose , so he resignedly gave orders to the porters to make straight for the Rong mansion ."
那时 王夫人 巳 知 薛蟠 官司 一事 亏 贾雨村 就 中 维持 了 ， 才 放 了 心 ， 又 见 哥哥 升 了 边 缺 ， 正愁 少 了 娘家 的 亲戚 来往 ， 略加 寂寞 ；,"Lady Wang had just breathed a sigh of relief on learning that the affair of Xue Pan 's manslaughter charge had been retrieved through the good offices of Jia Yu-cun , when the news that her elder brother had been promoted to a frontier post plunged her once more in gloom at the prospect of losing her main source of contact with the members of her own tamily ."
过 了 几日 ， 忽 家人 报 ： “ 姨太太 带 了 哥儿 姐儿 合家 进京 在 门外 下车 了 。 ”,"Several days passed in despondency , and then suddenly the servants announced that her sister , bringing her son and daughter and all her household with her , had arrived in the capital and was at that very moment outside the gate dismounting from her carriage ."
喜 的 王夫人 忙 带 了 人 接到 大厅 上 ， 将 薛姨妈 等 接 进去 了 ， 姊妹 们 一朝 相见 ， 悲喜交集 ， 自不必说 ；,"Delightedly she hurried with her women to the entrance of the main reception hall and conducted Aunt Xue and her party inside . The sudden reunion of the two sisters was , it goes without saying , an affecting one in which joy and sorrow mingled ."
叙 了 一番 契阔 ， 又 引着 拜见 贾母 ， 将 人情 土物 各种 酬 献 了 ， 合 家俱 厮见 过 ； 又 治席 接风 。,"After an exchange of information about the years of separation , and after they had been taken to see Grandmother Jia and made their reverence to her , and after the gifts of Nanking produce had been presented and everyone had been introduced to everyone else , there was a family party to welcome the new arrivals ."
薛蟠 拜见 过 贾政贾 琏 ， 又 引着 见 了 贾赦 贾珍 等 。,"Xue Pan , meanwhile , had paid his respects to Jia Zheng and Jia Lian and been taken to see Jia She and Cousin Zhen ."
贾政便 使 人 进来 对 王夫人 说 ：,Jia Zheng now sent a servant round to Lady Wang with the following message :
“ 姨太太 已有 了 年纪 ， 外甥 年轻 ， 不知 庶务 ， 在外 住 着 ， 恐 又 要 生事 ：,"' Your sister is getting on in years and our nephew is very young and seems rather inexperienced and , I fear , quite capable of getting into a scrape again if they are going to live outside ."
咱们 东北角 上 梨 香院 ， 那 一所 房 十来间 ， 白 空闲 着 ， 叫 人 请 了 姨太太 和 姐儿 哥儿 住 了 甚好 。 ”,Pear Tree Court in the north-east corner of our property is lying completely unoccupied at the moment and has quite a sizeable amount of room in it . Why not invite your sister and her children to move in there ? '
王夫人 原要 留住 ， 贾母 也 就 遣 人 来说 ： “ 请 姨太太 就 在 这里 住 下 ， 大家 亲密 些 。 ”,"Lady Wang had wanted all along to ask her sister to stay . Grandmother Jia had sent someone round to tell her that she should ' ask Mrs Xue to stay with us here , so that we can all be close to one another . '"
薛姨妈 正 欲 同居 一处 ， 方可 拘紧 些 儿 ， 若 另 在 外边 ， 又 恐 纵 性 惹祸 ， 遂 忙 应允 ； 又 私 与 王夫人 说明 ： “ 一应 日 费 供给 ， 一概 都 免 ， 方是 处常 之 法 。 ”,"And Aunt Xue for her own part had been wanting to stay so that some sort of check could be kept on her son . She was sure that if they were to be on their own somewhere else in the city his unbridled nature would precipitate some fresh calamity . She therefore accepted the invitation with alacrity , privately adding the proviso that she could only contemplate a long stay if it was on the understanding that they were themselves to be responsible for all their expenses ."
王夫人 知 他家 不难 于 此 ， 遂 亦 从 其 自便 ： 从此 后 ， 薛家 母女 就 在 梨 香院 住 了 。,"Lady Wang knew that money was no problem to them , so she readily consented , and Aunt Xue and her children proceeded there and then to move into Pear Tree Court ."
原来 这 梨 香院 乃 当日 荣公 暮年 养静之 所 ， 小 小巧 巧 ， 约 有 十余 间 房舍 ， 前厅 后舍 俱全 ；,"This Pear Tree Court had been the Duke of Rong-guo 's retreat during the last years of his life . Its buildings totalled not much more than ten frames ; but though small and charming , it was complete in every respect , with a little reception room in the front and all the usual rooms and offices behind ."
另 有 一门 通街 ， 薛蟠 的 家人 就 走 此 门 出入 ； 西南 上 又 有 一个 角门 ， 通着 夹道 子 ， 出 了 夹道 ， 便是 王夫人 正房 的 东院 了 。,"It had its own outer door on to the street , through which Xue Pan and the menservants could come and go , and another gate in the southwest corner giving on to a passage-way which led into the courtyard east of Lady Wang 's compound ."
每日 或 饭后 ， 或 晚间 ， 薛姨妈 便 过来 ， 或 与 贾母 闲谈 ， 或 与 王夫人 相叙 。,"Through this passage-way Aunt Xue would now daily repair , either after dinner or in the evening , to gossip with Grandmother Jia or reminisce with her sister , Lady Wang ."
宝钗 日 与 黛玉 、 迎春 姊妹 等 一处 ， 或 看书 下棋 ， 或 做 针黹 ， 倒 也 十分 相安 。,"Bao-chai for her part spent her time each day in great contentment , reading or playing Go or sewing with Dai-yu and the three girls ."
只是 薛蟠 起初 原不 欲 在 贾府中 居住 ， 生恐 姨父 管束 ， 不得 自 在 ； 无奈 母亲 执意 在 此 ， 且 贾宅 中 又 十分 殷勤 苦留 ， 只得 暂且 住 下 ， 一面 使 人 打扫 出 自家 的 房屋 ， 再 移居 过去 。,"The only dissatisfied member of the party - to begin with , at any rate - was Xue Pan . He had not wanted to stay in the Jia household , fearing that his uncle 's control would prevent him from enjoying himself , but what with his mother 's obstinacy and the insistence of the Jias themselves , he was obliged to acquiesce in settling there for the time being , contenting himself with sending some of his people to clean up one of their houses outside so that he would be able to move there later on ."
谁知 自 此间 住 了 不上 一月 ， 贾宅族 中 凡 有 的 子侄 ， 俱 已 认熟 了 一半 ， 都 是 那些 纨绔 气习 ， 莫不 喜 与 他 来往 ， 今日 会 酒 ， 明日 观花 ， 甚至 聚赌 嫖娼 ， 无所不至 ， 引诱 的 薛蟠 比 当日 更 坏 了 十倍 。,"But , to his pleasant surprise , he discovered that the young males of the Jia establishment , half of whom he was already on familiar terms with before he had been there a month , were of the same idle , extravagant persuasion as himself and thought him a capital fellow and boon companion . And so he found himself meeting them for a drinking-party one day , for theatre-going the next , on a third day perhaps gambling with them or visiting brothels . For there were no limits to the depravity of their pleasures , and Xue Pan , who was bad enough to start with , soon became ten times worse under their expert guidance ."
虽说 贾政 训子 有方 ， 治家 有 法 ， 一则 族 大人 多 ， 照管 不到 ；,"It was not that Jia Zheng was a slack disciplinarian , incapable of keeping his house in order ; but the clan was so numerous that he simply could not keep an eye on everyone at once ."
二则 现在 房长 乃是 贾珍 ， 彼 乃 宁府 长孙 ， 又 现袭 职 ， 凡族 中 事 都 是 他 掌管 ；,"And in any case the nominal head of the family was not Jia Zheng but Cousin Zhen who , as eldest grandson of the senior , Ning-guo branch , had inherited the founder 's office and emoluments and was therefore officially in charge of all the clan 's affairs ."
三则 公私 冗杂 ， 且 素性 潇洒 ， 不 以 俗事 为 要 ， 每 公暇 之 时 ， 不过 看书 着 棋 而已 ；,"Besides , Jia Zheng was kept busy with public and private business of his own and , being by nature a quiet , retiring man who attached little importance to mundane affairs , tended to use whatever leisure time he had for reading and playing Go."
况 这 梨 香院 相隔 两层 房舍 ， 又 有 街门 别 开 ， 任意 可以 出入 ， 这些 子弟 们 ， 所以 只管 放意 畅怀 的 。,"Then again , the Pear Tree Court was two courtyards away from Jia Zheng 's compound and had its own private door onto the street by which Xue Pan could come and go as he pleased , so that he and his young cronies could enjoy themselves to their heart 's content with no one being any the wiser ."
因此 薛蟠遂 将 移居 之 念 ， 渐渐 打灭 了 。,Under these agreeable circumstances Xue Pan gradually abandoned all thought of moving out .
日后 如何 ， 下回分解 。,But as to the outcome of these capers : that will be told in a later chapter .
第五回,Chapter 5
贾宝玉 神游 太虚 境,Jia Bao-yu visits the Land of Illusion
警幻 仙曲 演 红楼梦,And the fairy Disenchantment performs the ' Dream of Golden Days '
［ 第四回 中 既 将 薛家 母子 在 荣府 中 寄居 等 事略 已 表明 ， 此 回 暂 可不 写 了 。 ］,
如今 且说 林黛玉 自 在 荣府 ， 一来 贾母 万般 怜爱 ， 寝食 起居 ， 一如 宝玉 ， 把 那 迎春 、 探春 、 惜春 三个 孙女儿 倒且 靠 后 了 ；,"From the moment Lin Dai-yu entered the Rong mansion , Grandmother Jia is solicitude for her had manifested itself in a hundred different ways . The arrangements made for her meals and accommodation were exactly the same as for Bao-yu . The other three granddaughters , Ying-chun , Tan-chun and Xi-chun , were relegated to a secondary place in the old lady 's affections , and the objects of her partiality themselves began to feel an affection for each other which far exceeded what they felt for any of the rest ."
就是 宝玉 黛玉 二人 的 亲密 友爱 ， 也 较 别人 不同 ； 日 则 同行 同 坐 ， 夜 则 同止 同息 ， 真是 言和意顺 ， 似漆如胶 。,"Sharing each other 's company every minute of the day and sleeping in the same room at night , they developed an understanding so intense that it was almost as if they had grown into a single person ."
不想 如今 忽然 来 了 一个 薛宝钗 ， 年纪 虽 大不多 ， 然 品格 端方 ， 容貌 美丽 ， 人人 都 说 黛玉 不及 。 那宝钗 却 又 行为 豁达 ， 随分 从 时 ， 不 比黛玉 孤高自许 ， 目无下尘 ， 故 深得 下 人 之 心 ； 就是 小丫头 们 ， 亦 多 和 宝钗 亲近 。,"And now suddenly this Xue Bao-chai had appeared on the scene - a young lady who , though very little older than Dai-yu , possessed a grown-up beauty and aplomb in which all agreed Dai-yu was her inferior . Moreover , in contrast to Dai-yu with her air of lofty self-sufficiency and total obliviousness to all who did not move on the same exalted level as herself , Bao-chai had a generous , accommodating disposition which greatly endeared her to subordinates , so that even the tiniest maid looked on Miss Bao-chai as a familiar friend ."
因此 黛玉 心中 便 有些 不忿 ； 宝钗 却是 浑然不觉 。,"Dai-yu could not but feel somewhat put out by this - a fact of which Bao-chai herself , however , was totally unaware ."
那宝玉 也 在 孩提 之间 ， 况 他 天性 所 禀 ， 一片 愚拙 偏僻 ， 视 姊妹 兄弟 皆 如 一体 ， 并 无 亲疏 远近 之 别 。,"As for Bao-yu , he was still only a child - a child , moreover , whom nature had endowed with the eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton . Brothers , sisters , cousins , were all one to him . In his relationships with people he made no distinction between one person and another ."
如今 与 黛玉 同处 贾母房 中 ， 故略 比 别的 姊妹 熟惯 些 。 既 熟惯 ， 便 更 觉 亲密 ；,"If his relationship with Dai-yu was exceptional , it was because greater proximity - since she was living with him in his grandmother 's quarters - made her more familiar to him than the rest ; and greater familiarity bred greater intimacy ."
既 亲密 ， 便 不免有些 不虞之隙 ， 求全之毁 。,"And of course , with greater intimacy came the occasional tiffs and misunderstandings that are usual with people who have a great deal to do with each other ."
这日 不知 为何 ， 二人 言语 有些 不 和 起来 ， 黛玉 又 在 房中 独自 垂泪 ， 宝玉 也 自悔 言语 冒 撞 ， 前去 俯就 ， 那黛玉 方 渐渐 的 回转 过来 。,"One day the two of them had fallen out over something or other and the argument had ended with Dai-yu crying alone in her room and Bao-yu feeling remorsefully that perhaps he had spoken too roughly . Presently he went in to make his peace with her and gradually , very gradually , Dai-yu 's equanimity was restored ."
因 东边 宁府 花园 内 梅花 盛开 ， 贾珍之 妻 尤氏乃 治 酒具 ， 请 贾母 、 邢夫人 、 王夫人 等 赏花 ， 是 日先 带 了 贾蓉 夫妻 二人 来面 请 。,"The winter plum in the gardens of the Ning Mansion was now at its best , and this particular day Cousin Zhen is wife , You-shi , had some wine taken into the gardens and came over in person , bringing her son Jia Rong and his young wife with her , to invite Grandmother Jia , Lady Xing and Lady Wang to a flower-viewing party ."
贾母 等于 早饭 后 过来 ， 就 在 会 芳园 游玩 ， 先茶 后 酒 。 不过 是 宁荣二 府 眷属 家宴 ， 并 无 别样 新 文 趣事 可记 。,"Grandmother Jia and the rest went round as soon as they had finished their breakfast . The party was in the All-scents Garden . It began with tea and continued with wine , and as it was a family gathering confined to the ladies of the Ning and Rong households , nothing particularly worth recording took place ."
一时 宝玉 倦怠 ， 欲 睡 中 觉 ， 贾母命 人 好生 哄 着 歇息 一回 再 来 。,"At one point in the party Bao-yu was overcome with tiredness and heaviness and expressed a desire to take an afternoon nap . Grandmother Jia ordered some of the servants to go back to the house with him and get him comfortably settled , adding that they might return with him later when he was rested ;"
贾蓉 媳妇 秦氏 便 忙 笑 道 ： “ 我们 这里 有 给 宝二叔 收拾 下 的 屋子 ， 老祖宗 放心 ， 只管 交给 我 就是 了 。 ”,"but Qin-shi , the little wife of Jia Rong , smilingly proposed an alternative . ' We have got just the room here for Uncle Bao . Leave him to me , Grannie dear ! He will be quite safe in my hands . '"
因 向宝玉 的 奶娘 丫鬟 等 道 ： “ 嬷嬷 、 姐姐 们 ， 请 宝二叔 跟 我 这里 来 。 ”,"She turned to address the nurses and maidservants who were in attendance on Bao-yu . ' Come , my dears ! Tell Uncle Bao to follow me . '"
贾母素 知 秦氏 是 极 妥当 的 人 ， — — 因 他 生 得 袅娜 纤巧 ， 行事 又 温柔 和平 ， 乃 重孙 媳 中 第一个 得意 之 人 ， — — 见 他 去 安置 宝玉 ， 自然 是 放心 的 了 。,"Grandmother Jia had always had a high opinion of Qin-shi 's trustworthiness - she was such a charming , delightful little creature , the favourite among her great-granddaughters-in-law - and was quite content to leave the arrangements to her ."
当下 秦氏 引 一簇 人 来 至 上房 内间 ， 宝玉 抬头 看见 是 一幅 画 挂 在 上面 ， 人物 固好 ， 其 故事 乃是 “ 燃 藜 图 ” 也 ， 心中 便 有些 不快 。,"Qin-shi conducted Bao-yu and his little knot of attendants to an inner room in the main building . As they entered , Bao-yu glanced up and saw a painting hanging above them on the opposite wall . The tigures in it were very finely executed . They represented Scholarly Diligence in the person of the Han philosopher Liu Xiang at his book , obligingly illuminated for him by a supernatural being holding a large flaming torch . Bao-yu found the painting - or rather its subject - distasteful ."
又 有 一副 对联 ， 写 的 是 ：,But the pair of mottoes which flanked it proved the last straw :
世事 洞明 皆 学问 ，,True learning implies a clear insight into human activities .
人情 练达 即 文章 。,Genuine culture involves the skilful manipulation of human relationships .
及 看 了 这 两句 ， 纵然 室 宇 精美 ， 铺陈 华丽 ， 亦 断断 不肯 在 这里 了 ， 忙 说 ： “ 快 出去 ！ 快 出去 ！ ”,In vain the elegant beauty and splendid furnishings of the room ! Qin-shi was given to understand in no uncertain terms that her uncle Bao-yu wished to be out of it at once .
秦氏 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 这里 还 不好 ， 往 那里 去 呢 ？ — — 要 不 就 往 我 屋里 去 罢 。 ”,"' It this is not good enough for you , ' said Qin-shi with a laugh , ' where are we going to put you ? - unless you would like to have your rest in my bedroom . '"
宝玉 点头 微笑 ， 一个 嬷嬷 说道 ： “ 那里 有个 叔叔 往 侄儿 媳妇 房里 睡觉 的 礼 呢 ？ ”,A little smile played over Bao-yu is face and he nodded . The nurses were shocked . ' An uncle sleep in the bedroom of his nephew 's wife ! Who ever heard of such a thing ! '
秦氏笑 道 ： “ 不怕 他 恼 ： 他 能 多 大 了 ， 就 忌讳 这些 个 ？,"Qin-shi laughed again . ' He will not misbehave . Good gracious , he is only a little boy ! We do not have to worry about that sort of thing yet !"
上月 你 没有 看见 我 那个 兄弟 来 了 ， 虽然 和 宝二叔 同年 ， 两个 人 要 站 在 一处 ， 只怕 那 一个 还 高 些 呢 。 ”,"You know my little brother who came last month : he is the same age as Uncle Bao , but if you stood them side by side I should not be a bit surprised if he was not the taller of the two . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 怎么 没有 见 过 他 ， 你 带 他 来 我 瞧瞧 。 ”,' Why haven ' t I seen your brother yet ? ' Bao-yu demanded . ' Bring him in and let me have a look at him !
众人 笑 道 ： “ 隔 着 二三十里 ， 那里 带 去 ？,The servants all laughed . ' Bring him in ? Why he is ten or twenty miles away !
见 的 日子 有 呢 ！ ”,But I expect you will meet him one of these days . '
说 着 大家 来 至 秦氏 卧房 。,In the course of this exchange the party had made its way to Qin-shi 's bedroom .
刚至 房中 ， 便 有 一股 细细的 甜香 ， 宝玉 此时 便 觉眼 饧 骨 软 ， 连 说 ： “ 好 香 ！ ”,"As Bao-yu entered , a subtle whift of the most delicious perfume assailed his nostrils , making a sweet stickiness inside his drooping eyelids and causing all the joints in his body to dissolve . ' What a lovely smell ! ' He repeated the words several times over ."
入 房向 壁上 看 时 ， 有 唐伯虎 画 的 “ 海棠 春 睡 图 ” ， 两边 有 宋 学士 秦太虚 写 的 一副 对联 云 ：,"Inside the room there was a painting by Tang Yin entitled ' Spring Slumber ' depicting a beautiful woman asleep under a crab-apple tree , whose buds had not yet opened . The painting was flanked on either side by a pair of calligraphic scrolls inscribed with a couplet from the brush of the Song poet Qin Guan :"
,( on one side )
嫩寒 锁 梦 因 春 冷 ，,The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream ;
,( on the other side )
芳气 袭 人 是 酒香 。,The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents .
案 上 设 着 武则天 当日 镜室 中 设 的 宝镜 。,On a table stood an antique mirror that had once graced the tiring-room of the lascivious empress Wu Ze-tian .
一边 摆 着 赵飞燕 立 着 舞 的 金盘 ， 盘内盛 着 安禄山 掷 过 伤 了 太真乳 的 木瓜 。,"Beside it stood the golden platter on which Flying Swallow once danced for her emperor 's delight . And on the platter was that very quince which the villainous An Lu-shan threw at beautiful Yang Gui-fei , bruising her plump white breast ."
上面 设 着 寿阳 公主 于含章 殿下 卧 的 宝榻 ， 悬 的 是 同昌 公主 制 的 连珠 帐 。,At the far end of the room stood the priceless bed on which Princess Shou-yang was sleeping out of doors under the eaves of the Han-zhang Palace when the plum-flower lighted on her forehead and set a new fashion for coloured patches . Over it hung a canopy commissioned by Princess Tong-chang entirely fashioned out of ropes of pearls .
宝玉 含笑 道 ： “ 这里 好 ！ 这里 好 ！ ”,"' I like it here , said Bao-yu happily ."
秦氏笑 道 ： “ 我 这 屋子 大约 神仙 也 可以 往得 了 。 ”,"' My room , ' said Qin-shi with a proud smile , ' is fit for an immortal to sleep in ."
说 着 ， 亲自 展开 了 西施 浣 过 的 纱 衾 ， 移 了 红娘 抱 过 的 鸳枕 ， 于是 众 奶 姆 伏侍宝玉 卧 好 了 ， 款款 散 去 ， 只 留下 袭 人 、 晴雯 、 麝月 、 秋纹 四个 丫鬟 为伴 。,"And she unfolded a quilted coverlet , whose silk had been laundered by the fabulous Xi Shi , and arranged the double head-rest that Hong-niang once carried for her amorous mistress . The nurses now helped Bao-yu into bed and then tiptoed out , leaving him attended only by his four young maids : Aroma , Skybright , Musk , and Ripple ."
秦氏 便 叫 小 丫鬟 们 好生 在 檐下 看着 猫儿 打架 。,Qin-shi told them to go outside and stop the cats from fighting on the eaves .
那宝玉 才 合上 眼 ， 便 恍恍惚惚 的 睡去 ， 犹似 秦氏 在 前 ， 悠悠荡荡 ， 跟着 秦氏 到 了 一处 。,As soon as Bao-yu closed his eyes he sank into a confused sleep in which Qin-shi was still there yet at the same time seemed to be drifting along weightlessly in front of him . He followed her until they came to a place of marble terraces and vermilion balustrades where there were green trees and crystal streams .
但 见 朱栏玉 砌 ， 绿树 清溪 ， 真是 人迹 不逢 ， 飞尘 罕 到 。,Everything in this place was so clean and so pure that it seemed as if no human foot could ever have trodden there or floating speck of dust ever blown into it .
宝玉 在 梦 中 欢喜 ， 想道 ： “ 这个 地方 儿 有趣 ， 我 若 能 在 这里 过 一生 ， 强 如 天天 被 父母 师傅 管束 呢 ！ ”,Bao-yu is dreaming self rejoiced . ' What a delightful place ! he thought . ' If only I could spend all my life here ! How much nicer it would be than living under the daily restraint of my parents and teachers ! '
正在 胡思乱想 ， 听见 山后 有人 作歌 曰 ：,These idle reflections were interrupted by someone singing a song on the other side of a hill :
春梦 随 云散 ，,"' Spring 's dream-time will like drifting clouds disperse ,"
飞花 逐 水流 ；,Its flowers snatched by a flood none can reverse .
寄 言 众 儿女 ：,Then tell each nymph and swain
何必 觅 闲愁 。,' Tis folly to invite love 's pain ! '
宝玉 听 了 是 个 女孩儿 的 声气 。,It was the voice of a girl .
歌音 未息 ， 早 见 那边 走出 一个 美 人 来 ， 翩跹 袅娜 ， 与 凡人 大不相同 。 有 赋为 证 :,"Before its last echoes had died away , a beautiful woman appeared in the quarter from which the voice had come , approaching him with a floating , fluttering motion . She was quite unlike any earthly lady , as the following poem will make clear :"
方离 柳坞 ， 乍 出 花房 。,"She has left her willow-tree house , from her blossoming bower stepped out ;"
但 行处 ， 鸟惊庭树 ；,"For the birds betray where she walks through the trees that cluster about ,"
将 到 时 ， 影度 回廊 。,"And a shadow athwart the winding walk announces that she is near ,"
仙 袂 乍 飘 兮 ， 闻 麝兰 之 馥郁 ；,"And a fragrance of musk and orchid from fluttering fairy sleeves ,"
荷衣欲动 兮 ， 听 环佩 之 铿锵 。,And a tinkle of girdle-gems that falls on the ear At each movement of her dress of lotus leaves .
展笑 春桃 兮 ，,A peach-tree blossoms in her dimpling cheek ;
云髻 堆 翠 ；,Her cloud-coiled tresses are halcyon-sleek ;
唇 绽 樱 颗 兮 ，,"And she reveals , through parted cherry lips ,"
榴齿 含香 。,Teeth like pomegranate pips .
盻 纤腰 之 楚楚 兮 ，,Her slim waist 's sinuous swaying calls to mind
风回雪舞 ；,The dance of snowflakes with the waltzing wind ;
耀 珠翠 之的 的 兮 ，,Hair ornaments of pearl and halcyon blue
鸭绿 鹅黄 。,Outshine her painted forehead 's golden hue .
出没 花间 兮 ，,"Her face , through blossoms fleetingly disclosed ,"
宜嗔宜喜 ；,To mirth or ire seems equally disposed ;
徘徊 池上 兮 ，,"And as by the waterside she goes ,"
若飞若扬 。,"Hovering on light-stepping toes ,"
蛾眉 欲颦兮 ，,A half-incipient look of pique
将 言而未语 ；,"Says she would speak , yet would not speak ;"
莲步 乍 移 兮 ，,"While her feet , with the same irresolution ,"
欲止 而 仍 行 。,"Would halt , yet would not interrupt their motion ."
羡 美 人 之 良质 兮 ，,"I contemplate her rare complexion ,"
冰清玉润 ；,Ice-pure and jade-like in perfection ;
慕美人 之 华服 兮 ，,"I marvel at her glittering dress ,"
闪烁 文章 。,Where art lends grace to sumptuousness ;
爱美 人 之 容貌 兮 ，,I wonder at her fine-cut features -
香培玉 篆 ；,"Marble , which fragrance marks as one with living creatures ;"
比美 人 之 态度 兮 ，,"And I admire her queenly gait ,"
凤翥龙翔 。,Like stately dance of simurgh with his mate .
其 素 若何 ：,Her purity I can best show
春梅 绽 雪 ；,In plum-trees flowering in the snow ;
其 洁 若何 ：,Her chastity I shall recall
秋蕙 披 霜 。,In orchids white at first frost-fall ;
其 静 若何 ：,"Her tranquil nature will prevail ,"
松生 空谷 ；,Constant as lone pine in an empty vale ;
其 艳 若何 ：,Her loveliness as dazzled make
霞 映 澄塘 。,As sunset gilding a pellucid lake ;
其 文 若何 ：,Her glittering elegance I can compare
龙游曲沼 ；,With dragons in an ornamental mere ;
其 神 若何 ：,Her dreamy soulfulness most seems
月 射 寒江 。,Like wintry waters in the moon 's cold beams .
— — 远 惭 西子 ， 近 愧 王 嫱 。,The beauties of days gone by by her beauty are all abashed .
生于 孰 地 ？ 降 自 何方 ？,"Where was she born , and from whence descended ?"
若非 宴 罢 归来 ， 瑶池 不二 ；,"Immortal I judge her , fresh come from fairy feastings by the Jasper Pool ,"
定应 吹箫 引 去 ， 紫府 无双 者 也 。,"Or from fluting in starry halls , some heavenly concert ended ."
宝玉 见 是 一个 仙姑 ， 喜 的 忙 来 作揖 ， 笑 问道 ： “ 神仙姐姐 ， 不知 从 那里 来 ， 如今 要 往 那里 去 ？ 我 也 不知 这里 是 何处 ， 望 乞 携带 携带 。 ”,"Observing delightedly that the lady was a fairy , Bao-yu hurried forward and saluted her with a smile . ' Madam Fairy , I do not know where you have come from or where you are going to , but as I am quite lost in this place , will you please take me with you and be my guide ? '"
那 仙姑 道 ： “ 吾 居 离恨 天 之上 ， 灌愁 海 之中 ， 乃放 春山 遣 香洞 太虚幻境 警幻 仙姑 是 也 。,"' I am the fairy Disenchantment , ' the fairy woman replied . ' I live beyond the Realm of Separation , in the Sea of Sadness . There is a Mountain of Spring Awakening which rises from the midst of that sea , and on that mountain is the Paradise of the Full-blown Flower , and in that paradise is the Land of Illusion , which is my home ."
司 人间 之 风情月债 ， 掌 尘世 之 女怨 男痴 。,"My business is with the romantic passions , love-debts , girlish heartbreaks and male philanderings of your duststained , human world ."
因 近来 风流冤孽 ， 缠绵 于 此 ， 是 以前 来访 察 机会 ， 布散 相思 。,"The reason I have come here today is that recently there has been a heavy concentration of love-karma in this area , and I hope to be able to find an opportunity of distributing a quantity of amorous thoughts by implanting them in the appropriate breasts ."
今日 与 尔 相逢 ， 亦非 偶然 。,My meeting you here today is no accident but a part of the same project .
此 离 吾 境 不远 ， 别无他物 ， 仅 有 自 采仙茗 一盏 ， 亲酿 美酒 几 瓮 ， 素练魔舞 歌姬 数 人 ， 新 填 ‘ 红楼梦 ’ 仙曲 十二支 ， 可试 随 我一 游否 ？ ”,"' This place where we are now is not so very far from my home . I have not much to offer you , but would you like to come back with me and let me try to entertain you ? I have some fairy tea , which I picked myself . You could have a cup of that . And I have a few jars of choice new wine of my own brewing . I have also been rehearsing a fairy choir and a troupe of fairy dancers in a twelve-part suite which I recently composed called "" A Dream of Golden Days "" . I could get them to perform it for you . What do you think ? '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 喜跃 非常 ， 便 忘 了 秦氏 在 何处 了 ， 竟 随着 这 仙姑 到 了 一个 所在 。,Bao-yu was so excited by this invitation that he quite forgot to wonder what had become of Qin-shi in his eagerness to accompany the fairy .
忽 见 前面 有 一座 石牌 横建 ， 上书 “ 太虚幻境 ” 四大 字 ， 两边 一副 对联 ， 乃是 ：,"As he followed her , a big stone archway suddenly loomed up in front of them on which THE LAND OF ILLUSION was written in large characters . A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed on either side of the arch :"
假作 真时 真 亦 假 ，,Truth becomes fiction when the fiction 's true ;
无为 有 处有 还 无 。,Real becomes not-real when the unreal 's real .
转过 牌坊 ， 便是 一座 宫门 ， 上面 横书 着 四个 大字 ， 道 是 ： “ 孽海 情天 ” 。 也 有 一副 对联 ， 大书云 ：,"Having negotiated the archway , they presently came to the gateway of a palace . The following words were inscribed horizontally above the lintel : SEAS OF PAIN AND SKIES OF PASSION whilst the following words were inscribed vertically on the two sides :"
厚 地 高 天 ，,Ancient earth and sky
堪叹 古今 情 不尽 ；,Marvel that love 's passion should outlast all time .
痴男怨女 ，,Star-crossed men and maids
可怜 风月 债难酬 。,Groan that love 's debts should be so hard to pay .
宝玉 看 了 ， 心下 自思道 ： “ 原来如此 。 但 不知 何为 ‘ 古今之 情 ’ ？,"' I see , ' said Bao-yu to himself . ' I wonder what the meaning of "" passion that outlasts all time "" can be ."
又 何为 ‘ 风月 之 债 ’ ？,"And what are "" love 's debts "" ?"
从今 倒 要 领略 领略 。 ”,From now on I must make an effort to understand these things . '
宝玉 只顾 如此 一 想 ， 不料 早 把 些 邪魔 招入 膏肓 了 。,"He could not , of course , have known it , but merely by thinking this he had invited the attentions of the demon Lust , and at that very moment a little of the demon 's evil poison had entered Bao-yu is body and lodged itself in the innermost recesses of his heart ."
当下 随了 仙姑 进入 二层 门内 ， 只见 两边 配殿 ， 皆 有 匾额 对联 ， 一时 看 不尽 许多 ， 惟见 几处 写 着 的 是 ： “ 痴情 司 ” ， “ 结怨 司 ” ， “ 朝 啼司 ” ， “ 暮 哭司 ” ， “ 春 感司 ” ， “ 秋 悲司 ” 。,"Wholly unconscious of his mortal peril , Bao-yu continued to follow the fairy woman . They passed through a second gateway , and Bao-yu saw a range of palace buildings ahead of them on either hand . The entrance to each building had a board above it proclaiming its name , and there were couplets on either side of the doorways . Bao-yu did not have time to read all of the names , but he managed to make out a few , viz : DEPARTMENT OF FOND INFATUATION DEPARTMENT OF CRUEL REJECTION DEPARTMENT OF EARLY MORNING WEEPING DEPARTMENT OF LATE NIGHT SOBBING DEPARTMENT OF SPRING FEVER DEPARTMENT OF AUTUMN GRIEF"
看 了 ， 因向 仙姑 道 ： “ 敢 烦 仙姑 引 我 到 那 各 司 中 游玩 游玩 ， 不知 可 使得 么 ？ ”,"' Madam Fairy , ' said Bao-yu , whose interest had been whetted by what he had managed to read , ' could not you take me inside these offices to have a look around ? '"
仙姑 道 ： “ 此中 各 司存 的 是 普天下 所有 的 女子 过去 未来 的 簿册 ， 尔乃凡 眼尘 躯 ， 未便 先知 的 。 ”,"' In these offices , ' said the fairy woman , ' are kept registers in which are recorded the past , present and future of girls from all over the world . It is not permitted that your earthly eyes should look on things that are yet to come . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 那里 肯舍 ， 又 再 四 的 恳求 。,"Bao-yu was most unwilling to accept this answer , and begged and pleaded so persistently that at last Disenchantment gave in ."
那 警幻 便 说 ： “ 也罢 ， 就 在 此 司内略 随喜 随喜 罢 。 ”,' Very well . You may make a very brief inspection of this office here . '
宝玉 喜不自胜 ， 抬头 看 这 司 的 匾 上 ， 乃是 “ 薄命 司 ” 三 字 ， 两边 写 着 对联 道 ：,"Delighted beyond measure , Bao-yu raised his head and read the notice above the doorway : DEPARTMENT OF THE ILL-FATED FAIR The couplet inscribed vertically on either side of the doorway was as follows :"
春 恨 秋悲皆自惹 ，,Spring griefs and autumn sorrows were by yourselves provoked .
花容月貌 为 谁 妍 。,"Flower faces , moonlike beauty were to what end disclosed ?"
宝玉 看 了 ， 便 知 感叹 。,Bao-yu grasped enough of the meaning to be affected by its melancholy .
进入 门中 ， 只见 有 十数个 大橱 ， 皆 用 封条 封着 。 看 那 封条 上 ， 皆 有 各省 字样 。,"Passing inside , he saw a dozen or more large cupboards with paper strips pasted on their doors on which were written the names of different provinces ."
宝玉 一心 只 拣 自己 家乡 的 封条 看 ， 只见 那边 橱 上 封条 大 书 “ 金陵 十二钗 正册 ” ， 宝玉 因 问 ： “ 何为 ‘ 金陵 十二钗 正册 ’ ？ ” 警幻 道 ： “ 即尔省 中 十二 冠首 女子 之 册 ， 故 为 正册 。 ”,"He was careful to look out for the one belonging to his own area and presently found one on which the paper strip said ' Jinling , Twelve Beauties of , Main Register ' . Bao-yu asked Disenchantment what this meant , and she explained that it was a register of the twelve most outstanding girls of his home province ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 常 听 人 说 ， 金陵 极大 ， 怎么 只 十二个 女子 ？,"' People all say what a big place Jinling is , ' said Bao-yu . ' Surely there should be more than just twelve names ?"
如今 单 我们 家里 ， 上上下下 就 有 几百个 女孩儿 。 ”,"Why , even in my own home , if you count the servants , there must be altogether several hundred girls . '"
警幻 微笑 道 ： “ 一 省 女子 固多 ， 不过 择 其 紧要 者 录 之 ， 两边 二 橱则 又 次之 。,"' Certainly there are a great many girls in the whole province , ' said Disenchantment with a smile , ' but only the most important ones have been selected for recording in this register . The registers in the cupboards on either side contain two other selections from the same area ."
一 余者 庸常 之辈 便 无册 可录 了 。 ”,But of the host of ordinary girls outside those three dozen we keep no records .
宝玉 再 看 下首 一 橱 ， 上 写 着 “ 金陵 十二钗 副 册 ” ， 又 一 橱 上 写 着 “ 金陵 十二钗 又 副 册 ” 。,"Bao-yu glanced at the other two cupboards referred to by Disenchantment . One was labelled Jinling , Twelve Beauties of , Supplementary Register No.1 ' ; the other was labelled Jinling , Twelve Beauties of , Supplementary Register No.2 ' ."
宝玉 便 伸手 先 将 “ 又 副 册 ” 橱门 开 了 ， 拿出 一本 册来 ， 揭开 看 时 ， 只见 这 首页 上画 的 ， 既 非 人物 ， 亦非 山水 ， 不过 是 水墨 滃 染 ， 满纸 乌云 浊雾 而已 。 后 有 几行 字迹 ， 写道 是 ：,"Stretching out his hand he opened the door of the second one , took out Supplementary Register No.2 , which was like a large album , and opened it at the first page . It was a picture , but not of a person or a view . The whole page was covered with dark ink washes representing storm-clouds or fog , followed on the next page by a few lines of verse :"
霁月 难逢 ，,"Seldom the moon shines in a cloudless sky ,"
彩云易散 。,And days of brightness all too soon pass by .
心比天高 ，,A noble and aspiring mind
身为 下贱 。,"In a base-born frame confined ,"
风流 灵巧 招人 怨 。,"Your charm and wit did only hatred gain ,"
寿天多 因 诽谤 生 ，,"And in the end you were by slanders slain ,"
多情 公子 空 牵念 。,Your gentle lord 's solicitude 1 vain .
宝玉 看 了 不 甚 明白 。,"Bao-yu could not make much sense of this , and turned to the next page ."
又 见 后面 画 着 一簇 鲜花 ， 一床 破席 ， 也 有 几句 言词 ， 写道 是 ：,"It was another picture , this time of a bunch of fresh flowers and a worn-out mat , again followed by a few lines of verse ."
枉自 温柔 和顺 ，,"What price your kindness and compliance ,"
空云 似 桂如兰 ；,Of sweetest flower the rich perfume ?
堪羡 优伶 有 福 ，,"You chose the player fortune favoured ,"
谁知 公子 无缘 。,Unmindful of your master 's doom .
宝玉 看 了 ， 益发 解说 不出 是 何 意思 ， 遂 将 这 一本 册子 搁起来 ， 又 去 开 了 “ 副 册 ” 橱门 。 拿 起 一本 册来 ， 打开 看 时 ， 只见 首页 也 是 画 ， 却 画 着 一枝 桂花 ， 下面 有 一方 池沼 ， 其中 水涸 泥干 ， 莲 枯 藕 败 ， 后面 书云 ：,"Bao-yu was even more mystified by this than by the first page , and laying the album aside , opened the door of the cupboard marked ' Supplementary Register No.1 ' and took out the album from that . As in the previous album , the first page was a picture . It represented a branch of cassia with a pool underneath . The water in the pool had dried up and the mud in the bottom was dry and cracked . Growing from it was a withered and broken lotus plant . The picture was followed by these lines :"
根 并 荷花 一 茎 香 ，,"Your stem grew from a noble lotus root ,"
平生 遭际 实堪 伤 ；,"Yet your life passed , poor flower , in low repute ."
自从 两地 生孤木 ，,"The day two earths shall bear a single tree ,"
致使 香魂 返 故乡 。,Your soul must fly home to its own country .
宝玉 看 了 又 不解 。 又 去取 那 “ 正册 ” 看 时 ， 只见 头 一页 上 画 着 是 两株 枯木 ， 木 上 悬 着 一围 玉带 ； 地下 又 有 一堆 雪 ， 雪 中 一股 金簪 。 也 有 四句 诗道 ：,"Once more failing to make any sense of what he saw , Bao-yu picked up the Main Register to look at . In this album the picture on the first page represented two dead trees with a jade belt hanging in their branches and on the ground beneath them a pile of snow in which a golden hairpin lay half-buried . This was followed by a quatrain :"
可叹 停机 德 ，,"One was a pattern of female virtue ,"
堪怜 咏絮 才 ！,One a wit who made other wits seem slow .
玉带 林中 挂 ，,"The jade belt in the greenwood hangs ,"
金簪 雪 里 埋 。,The gold pin is buried beneath the snow .
宝玉 看 了 仍 不解 ， 待 要 问 时 ， 知 他 必 不肯 泄漏天机 ；,"Still Bao-yu was unable to understand the meaning . He would have liked to ask , but he knew that Disenchantment would be unwilling to divulge the secrets of her immortal world ."
待 要 丢下 ， 又 不 舍 ， 遂 往后 看 。,"Yet though he could make no sense of the book , for some reason he found himself unable this time to lay it down , and continued to look through it to the end ."
只见 画 着 一张 弓 ， 弓 上 挂 着 一个 香 橡 。 也 有 一首歌 词云 ：,"The picture that followed was of a bow with a citron hanging from it , followed by what looked like the words of a song :"
二十年 来辨 是非 ，,"You shall , when twenty years in life 's hard school are done ,"
榴花 开处 照 宫闱 ；,In pomegranate-time to palace halls ascend .
三春争 及 初 春景 ，,"Though three springs never could with your first spring compare ,"
虎 兔 相逢 大 梦 归 。,When hare meets tiger your great dream shall end .
后面 又 画 着 两个 人 放风筝 ， 一片 大海 ， 一只 大船 ， 船中 有 一 女子 ， 掩面 泣涕 之 状 。,Next was a picture of two people flying a kite . There was also a large expanse of sea with a boat in it and a girl in the boat who had buried her face in her hands and appeared to be crying .
画 后 也 有 四句 写 着 道 ：,This was followed by a quatrain :
才 自 清明 志自高 ，,"Blessed with a shrewd mind and a noble heart ,"
生于 末世 运 偏 消 ；,"Yet born in time of twilight and decay ,"
清明 涕泣 江边 望 ，,"In spring through tears at river 's bank you gaze ,"
千里 东风 一梦 遥 。,Borne by the wind a thousand miles away .
后面 又 画 着 几缕 飞云 ， 一 湾 逝水 。 其 词曰 ：,The next picture showed some scudding wisps of cloud and a stretch of running water followed by these words :
富贵 又 何为 ？,"What shall avail you rank and riches ,"
襁褓 之间 父母 违 ；,Orphaned while yet in swaddling bands you lay ?
展眼 吊斜 辉 ，,Soon you must mourn your bright sun 's early setting .
湘江 水 逝 楚云飞 。,The Xiang flows and the Chu clouds sail away .
后面 又 画 着 一块 美玉 落 在 泥污 之中 。 其 断语 云 ：,"Next was a picture showing a beautiful jade which had fallen into the mud , followed by words of judgement :"
欲洁 何曾洁 ，,For all your would-be spotlessness
云空 未必 空 ；,"And vaunted otherworldliness ,"
可怜 金玉 质 ，,"You that look down on common flesh and blood ,"
终 陷 淖 泥 中 。,"Yourself ' impure , shall end up in the mud ."
后面 忽 画 一 恶狼 ， 追扑 一 美女 — — 欲 啖 之 意 。,Next was a striking picture of a savage wolf pursuing a beautiful girl . He had just seized her with his jaws and appeared to be about to eat her .
其 下书 云 :,Underneath it was written :
子系 中山狼 ，,"Paired with a brute like the wolf in the old fable ,"
得志 便 猖狂 ；,"Who on his saviour turned when he was able ,"
金 闺 花柳 质 ，,"To cruelty not used , your gentle heart"
一载 赴 黄粱 。,"Shall , in a twelvemonth only , break apart ."
后面 便是 一所 古庙 ， 里面 有 一美人 ， 在内 看 经 独坐 。,After this was an old temple with a beautiful girl sitting all on her own inside it reading a Buddhist siitra .
其 判 云 ：,The words said :
勘破 三 春景 不 长 ，,"When you see through the spring scene 's transient state ,"
缁 衣 顿改 昔年 妆 ；,A nun 's black habit shall replace your own .
可怜 绣户 侯门 女 ，,"Alas , that daughter of so great a house"
独卧 青灯古佛 旁 。,By Buddha 's altar lamp should sleep alone !
后面 便是 一片 冰山 ， 上 有 一只 雌 凤 。 其 判 云 ：,"Next was an iceberg with a hen phoenix perched on the top of it , and these words :"
凡鸟 偏 从 末世 来 ，,This phoenix in a bad time came ;
都 知 爱慕 此生 才 ；,All praised her great ability .
一 从 二 令 三 人木 ，,' Two ' makes my riddle with Q man and tree :
哭 向 金陵 事 更 哀 。,Returning south in tears she met calamity .
后面 又 是 一座 荒村 野店 ， 有一 美人 在 那里 纺绩 。 其 判 日 ：,"Next was a cottage in a deserted village inside which a beautiful girl sat spinning , followed by these words :"
势败休 云贵 ，,"When power is lost , rank matters not Q jot ;"
家 亡莫论 亲 ；,"When families fall , kinship must be forgot ."
偶 因济 村妇 ，,Through a chance kindness to a country wife
巧得遇 恩人 。,Deliverance came for your afflicted life .
诗 后 又 画 一盆 茂兰 ， 旁 有 一位 凤冠霞帔 的 美人 。,"This was followed by a picture of a vigorously growing orchid in a pot , beside which stood a lady in full court dress ."
也 有 判 云 ：,The words said :
桃李春风 结子 完 ，,"The plum-tree bore her fruit after the rest ,"
到头 谁 似 一盆 兰 ；,"Yet , when all 's done , her Orchid was the best ."
如 冰水 好 空相 妒 ，,Against your ice-pure nature all in vain
枉 与 他人 作 笑谈 。,The tongues of envy wagged ; you felt no pain .
诗 后 又 画 一座 高楼 ， 上有 一美人 悬梁自尽 。,"The picture after that showed an upper room in a tall building in which a beautiful girl was hanging by her neck from a beam , having apparently taken her own life ."
其 判 云 ：,The words said :
情天 情海 幻 情深 ，,"Love was her sea , her sky ; in such excess"
情 既 相逢 必主 淫 ；,"Love , meeting with its like , breeds wantonness ."
漫言 不肖 皆 荣出 ，,Say not our troubles all from Rong 's side came ;
造衅 开端 实在 宁 。,For their beginning Ning must take the blame .
宝玉 还 欲 看 时 ， 那 仙姑 知 他 天分 高明 、 性情 颖慧 ， 恐 泄漏天机 ， 便 掩 了 卷册 ， 笑 向宝玉 道 ： “ 且 随 我 去 游玩 奇景 ， 何必 在 此 打 这 闷葫芦 ！ ”,"Bao-yu would have liked to see some more , but the fairy woman , knowing how intelligent and sharp-witted he was , began to fear that she was in danger of becoming responsible for a leakage of celestial secrets , and so , snapping the album shut , she said with a laugh , ' Come with me and we will do some more sight-seeing . Why stay here puzzling your head over these silly riddles ? '"
宝玉 恍恍惚惚 ， 不觉 弃 了 卷册 ， 又 随 警幻 来 至 后面 。,"Next moment , without quite knowing how it happened , Bao-yu found that he had left the place of registers behind him and was following Disenchantment through the rear parts of the palace ."
但见 画 栋 雕檐 ， 珠帘 绣幕 ， 仙花 馥郁 ， 异草 芬芳 ， 真 好 所在 也 。,"Everywhere there were buildings with ornately carved and painted eaves and rafters , their doorways curtained with strings of pearls and their interiors draped with embroidered hangings . The courtyards outside them were full of deliciously fragrant fairy blooms and rare aromatic herbs ."
正是 ：,
光摇朱 户 金铺 地 ，,"Gleam of gold pavement flashed on scarlet doors ,"
雪照琼窗 玉作宫 。,And in jade walls jewelled casements snow white shone .
又 听 警幻 笑 道 ： “ 你们 快 出来 迎接 贵客 ！ ” 一 言 未了 ， 只见 房中 走出 几个 仙子 来 ： 荷 袂 翩跹 ， 羽衣 飘舞 ， 娇若 春花 ， 媚 如 秋月 。,"' Hurry , hurry ! Come out and welcome the honoured guest ! ' he heard Disenchantment calling to someone inside , and almost at once a bevy of fairy maidens came running from the palace , lotus-sleeves fluttering and feather-skirts billowing , each as enchantingly beautiful as the flowers of spring or the autumn moon ."
见 了 宝玉 ， 都 怨谤 警幻 道 ： “ 我们 不知 系何 ‘ 贵客 ’ ， 忙 的 接 出来 ！,"Seeing Bao-yu , they began to reproach Disenchantment angrily . ' So this is your "" honoured guest "" ! What do you mean by making us hurry out to meet him ?"
姐姐 曾 说 今日 今时 必 有 绛 珠 妹子 的 生魂 前来 游玩 ， 故 我 等 久 待 ， 何故 反引 这 浊物 来 污染 清净 女儿 之 境 ？ ”,"You told us that today at this very hour the dream-soul of our darling Crimson Pearl was coming to play with us , and we have been waiting I do not know how long for her arrival . And now , instead , you have brought this disgusting creature to pollute our pure , maidenly precincts . What is the idea ? '"
宝玉 听 如此 说 ， 便 吓 的 欲 退 不能 ， 果觉 自 形 污秽不堪 。,At these words Bao-yu was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of the uncleanness and impurity of his own body and sought in vain for somewhere to escape to ;
警幻 忙 携住 宝玉 的 手向 众 仙 姬 笑 道 ： “ 你 等 不知 原委 ：,but Disenchantment held him by the hand and advanced towards the fairy maidens with a conciliatory smile . ' Let me tell you the reason for my change of plan .
今日 原欲 往 荣府 去 接 绛 珠 ， 适从 宁府 经过 ， 偶遇 宁荣二 公之灵 ， 嘱吾 云 ：,"It is true that I set of for the Rong mansion with the intention of fetching Crimson Pearl , but as I was passing through the Ning mansion on my way , I happened to run into the Duke of Ning-guo and his brother the Duke of Rong-guo and they laid a solemn charge on me which I found it hard to refuse ."
‘ 吾 家 自国 朝 定鼎 以来 ， 功名 奕 世 ， 富贵 流传 ， 已 历 百年 ， 奈运 终数 尽 ， 不可 挽回 ！,""" In the hundred years since the foundation of the present dynasty , "" they said , "" several generations of our house have distinguished themselves by their services to the Throne and have covered themselves with riches and honours ; but now its stock of good fortune has run out , and nothing can be done to replenish it ."
我 等 之 子孙 虽 多 ， 竟 无 可以 继 业者 。,"And though our descendants are many , not one of them is worthy to carry on the line ."
惟 嫡孙 宝玉 一 人 ， 禀性 乖张 ， 用 情 怪谲 ， 虽 聪明 灵慧 ， 略 可望 成 ， 无奈 吾 家 运数 合终 ， 恐 无人 规 引入 正 。,"The only possible exception , our great-grandson Bao-yu , has inherited a perverse , intractable nature and is eccentric and emotionally unstable ; and although his natural brightness and intelligence augur well , we fear that owing to the fated eclipse of our family 's fortunes there will be no one at hand to give the lad proper guidance and to start him off along the right lines ."
幸 仙姑 偶来 ， 望先 以 情欲 声色 等 事警 其 痴顽 ， 或 能 使 他 跳出 迷人 圈子 ， 人 于 正路 ， 便是 吾 兄弟 之 幸 了 。 ’,""" May we profit from the fortunate accident of this encounter , Madam , to entreat you to take the boy in hand for us ? Could you perhaps initiate him in the pleasures of the flesh and all that sort of thing in such a way as to shock the silliness out of him ? In that way he might stand a chance of escaping some of the traps that people fall into and be able to devote himself single-mindedly to the serious things of life . It would be such a kindness if you would do this for us . '"
如此 嘱 吾 ， 故 发 慈心 ， 引彼 至此 。,"' Hearing the old gentlemen so earnest in their entreaty , I was moved to compassion and agreed to bring the boy here ."
先 以 他家 上中下 三等 女子 的 终身 册籍 ， 令 其 熟玩 ， 尚未 觉悟 ；,I began by letting him have a good look at the records of the three grades of girls belonging to his own household ; but the experience did not bring any awareness ;
故 引 了 再 到 此处 ， 遍历 那 饮 馔 声色 之 幻 ， 或 冀 将来 一 悟 ， 未可知 也 。 ”,"and so I have brought him to this place for another attempt . It is my hope that a full exposure to the illusions of feasting , drinking , music and dancing may succeed in bringing about an awakening in him some time in the future . '"
说 毕 ， 携 了 宝玉 入室 。,"Having concluded her explanation , she led Bao-yu indoors ."
但 闻 一缕 幽香 ， 不知 所 闻 何物 。,"At once he became aware of a faint , subtle scent , the source of which he was quite unable to identify and about which he felt impelled to question Disenchantment ."
宝玉 不禁 相问 ， 警幻 冷笑 道 ： “ 此 香 乃 尘世 所 无 ， 尔 如何 能 知 ！,"' How could you possibly know what it was , ' said Disenchantment with a somewhat scornful smile , ' since this perfume is not to be found anywhere in your mortal world ?"
此 系 诸 名山 胜境 初 生异卉 之 精 ， 合 各种 宝林 珠树 之 油 所 制 ， 名为 ‘ 群芳 髓 ’ 。 ”,"It is made from the essences of rare plants found on famous mountains and other places of great natural beauty , culled when they are new-grown and blended with gums from the pearl-laden trees that grow in the jewelled groves of paradise . It is called "" Belles Se Fanent "" . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 自 是 羡慕 。,Bao-yu expressed his admiration .
于是 大家 入座 ， 小鬟 捧 上 茶 来 ， 宝玉 觉得 香清味 美 ， 迥 非常 品 ， 因 又 问 何 名 。,"The company now seated themselves , and some little maids served them with tea . Bao-yu found its fragrance fresh and clean and its flavour delicious , totally unlike those of any earthly blend he knew . He asked Disenchantment for the name ."
警幻 道 ： “ 此 茶 出 在 放春 山 遣 香洞 ， 又 以 仙花 灵叶 上 所带 的 宿露 烹 了 ， 名曰 ‘ 千红一窟 ’ 。 ”,"' The leaves are picked in the Paradise of the Full-blown Flower on the Mountain of Spring Awakening , ' Disenchantment informed him . ' It is infused in water collected from the dew that lies on fairy flowers and leaves . The name is "" Maiden 's Tears "" . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 点头 称赏 。,Bao-yu nodded attentively and commended the tea .
因看 房内 瑶琴 、 宝鼎 、 古画 、 新诗 ， 无所不有 ；,"Looking around the room he noticed various musical instruments , antique bronzes , paintings by old masters , poems by new poets , and other hallmarks of gracious living ."
更 喜 窗下 亦 有 唾绒 ， 奁 间 时渍 粉污 。 壁上 也 挂 着 一副 对联 ， 书云 ：,"He was particularly delighted to observe some rouge-stained pieces of cotton-wool lying on the window-sill - evidently the aftermath of some fairy-woman 's toilet . A pair of calligraphic scrolls hung on the wall , making up the following couplet :"
幽微 灵秀 地 ，,Earth 's choicest spirits in the dark lie hid ;
无可奈何 天 。,Heaven ineluctably enforced their fate .
宝玉 看毕 ， 因 又 请问 众 仙姑 姓名 ： 一名 痴梦 仙姑 ， 一名 钟情 大士 ， 一名 引愁 金女 ， 一名 度 恨 菩提 ， 各 各 道 号 不 一 。,"After reading the scrolls , Bao-yu asked to be introduced to the fairy maidens . They had a strange assortment of names . One was called Dream-of-bliss , another was called Loving-heart , a third Ask-for-trouble , a fourth Past-regrets , and the rest all had names that were equally bizarre ."
少刻 ， 有 小鬟 来调 桌安椅 ， 摆设 酒 馔 ， 正是 ：,"Presently the little maids came in again and proceeded to arrange some chairs around a table and to lay it with food and wine for a feast . In the words of the poet ,"
琼浆 满 泛 玻璃 盏 ，,"Celestial nectar filled the crystal cup ,"
玉液 浓 斟 琥珀 杯 。,And liquid gold in amber goblets glowed .
宝玉 因此 酒香 冽 异常 ， 又 不禁 相问 。,"The wine 's bouquet was delectable , and once again Bao-yu could not resist asking about it ."
警幻 道 ： “ 此 酒 乃以 百花 之 蕤 ， 万木 之 汁 ， 加以 麟 髓 凤 乳 酿成 ， 因 名为 ‘ 万 艳同 杯 ’ 。 ”,"' This wine , ' said Disenchantment , ' is made from the petals of hundreds of different kinds of flowers and extracts from thousands of different sorts of trees . These are blended and fermented with kylin 's marrow and phoenix milk . Hence its name , "" Lachrymae Rerum "" . '"
宝玉 称赏 不迭 。,Bao-yu praised it enthusiastically .
饮酒 间 ， 又 有 十二个 舞女 上来 ， 请问 演何 调曲 ， 警幻 道 ： “ 就 将 新制 ‘ 红楼梦 ’ 十二支 演 上来 。 ”,"As they sat drinking wine , a troupe of twelve dancers entered and inquired what pieces they should perform for the company 's entertainment . ' You can do the twelve songs of my new song-and-dance suite "" A Dream of Golden Days "" , ' said Disenchantment ."
舞女 们 答应 了 ， 便 轻敲 檀板 ， 款 按 银筝 ， 听 他 歌道 是 ：,"At once the sandalwood clappers began , very softly , to beat out a rhythm , accompanied by the sedate twang of the zheng 's silver strings and by the voice of a singer ."
开辟 鸿蒙 … …,' When first the world from chaos rose . . . '
方歌 了 一句 ， 警幻 道 ： “ 此曲 不 比 尘世 中 所填 传奇 之 曲 ， 必 有 生旦净末 之则 ， 又 有 南北 九宫 之 调 。,"The singer had got no further than the first line of the first song when Disenchantment interrupted . ' This suite , ' she told Bao-yu , ' is not like the music-dramas of your earthly composers in which there are always the fixed parts of sheng , dan , jing , mo and so on , and set tunes in the various Northern and Southern modes ."
此 或 咏叹 一 人 ， 或 感怀 一事 ， 偶 成 一曲 ， 即可 谱入 管弦 。,In my suite each song is an elegy on a single person or event and the tunes are original compositions which we have orchestrated ourselves .
若非 个 中人 ， 不知 其中 之 妙 ， 料 尔 亦 未必 深明 此 调 ， 若 不先 阅 其 稿 ， 后 听 其 曲 ， 反 成 嚼蜡 矣 。 ”,"You need to know what the songs are about in order to appreciate them properly . I should not imagine you are very familiar with this sort of entertainment ; so unless you read the libretto of the songs first before listening to them , I fear you may find them rather insipid . '"
说 毕 ， 回头 命 小鬟 取 了 “ 红楼梦 ” 原稿 来 ， 递 与 宝玉 。 宝玉 接过 来 ， 一面 目视 其 文 ， 耳 聆 其 歌 曰 ：,"Turning to one of the maids , she ordered her to fetch the manuscript of her libretto of ' A Dream of Golden Days ' and gave it to Bao-yu to read , so that he could listen to the songs with one eye on the text . These were the words in Disenchantment 's manuscript :"
〔 红楼梦 引子 〕,Prelude : A Dream of Golden Days
开辟 鸿蒙 ，,"When first the world from chaos rose ,"
谁 为 情种 ？,"Tell me , how did love begin ?"
都 只 为 风月 情浓 。,The wind and moonlight first did love compose .
奈何 天 ，,Now woebegone
伤怀 日 ，,And quate cast down
寂寥 时 ，,In low estate
试遣 愚衷 ：,"I would my foolish heart expose ,"
因此 上 ，,And so perform
演出 这 悲 金悼玉 的 “ 红楼梦 ” 。,"This Dream of Golden Days , And all my grief for my lost loves disclose ."
〔 终身 误 〕,First Song : The Mistaken Marriage
都 道 是 金玉良缘 ，,Let others all Commend the marriage rites of gold and jade ;
俺 只 念 木 石前盟 。,I still recall The bond of old by stone and flower made ;
空 对着 ，,And while my vacant eves behold
山中 高士晶莹 雪 ；,"Crystalline snows of beauty pure and cold ,"
终不 忘 ，,From my mind can not be banished
世外 仙 姝 寂寞 林 。,That fairy wood forlorn that from the world has vanished .
叹 人间 ，,How true I find
美中不足 今 方信 ：,That every good some imperfection holds !
纵然 是 齐眉举案 ， 到底 意难 平 。,
〔 枉 凝 眉 〕,Second Song : Hope Betrayed
一个 是 阆 苑仙葩 ，,"One was a flower from paradise ,"
一个 是 美玉无瑕 。,One a pure jade without spot or stain .
若 说 没 奇缘 ，,"If each for the other one was not intended ,"
今生 偏 又 遇 着 他 ；,Then why in this life did they meet again ?
若 说 有 奇缘 ，,"And yet if fate had meant them for each other ,"
如何 心事 终 虚话 ？,Why was their earthly meeting all in vain ?
一个 枉自 嗟呀 ，,"In vain were all her sighs and tears ,"
一个 空 劳 牵挂 。,In vain were all his anxious fears :
,"All , insubstantial , doomed to pass ,"
一个 是 水中 月 ，,As moonlight mirrored in the water
一个 是 镜中花 。,Or flowers reflected in a glass .
想 眼中 能 有 多少 泪珠儿 ，,"How many tears from those poor eyes could flow ,"
怎 禁得 秋流 到 冬 ， 春 流到 夏 ！,Which every season rained upon her woe ?
［ 却说 宝玉 听 了 此曲 ， 散漫 无稽 ， 未见得 好处 ； 但其 声韵 凄婉 ， 竟 能 销魂 醉魄 。,
因此 也 不问 其 原委 ， 也 不 究其 来历 ， 就 暂 以此 释闷 而已 。,
因 又 看 下面 道 ： ］,
〔 恨 无常 〕,Third Song : Mutablity
喜 荣华 正好 ，,In the full flower of her prosperity
恨 无常 又 到 。,"Once more came mortal mutability ,"
眼睁睁 ，,"Bidding her , with both eyes wide ,"
把 万事 全 抛 。,"All earthly things to cast aside ,"
荡 悠悠 ， 芳魂 销耗 。,And her sweet soul upon the airs to glide .
望 家乡 ， 路 远山 高 。,So far the road back home did seem
故向 爹娘 梦 里 相 寻告 ：,That to her parents in a dream
,Thus she her final duty paid :
儿命 己入 黄泉 ，,"' I that now am but a shade ,"
天伦 呵 ，,"Parents dear ,"
,For your happiness I fear :
,Do not tempt the hand of fate !
须要 退步抽身 早 ！,"Draw back , draw back , before it is too late ! '"
〔 分 骨肉 〕,Fourth Song : From Dear Ones Parted
一 帆 风雨 路 三千 ，,"Sail , boat , a thousand miles through rain and wind ,"
把 骨肉 家园 ， 齐 来 抛 闪 。,Leaving my home and dear ones far behind .
恐 哭 损 残年 。,I fear that my remaining years Will waste away in homesick tears .
告 爹娘 ，,"Father dear and mother mild ,"
休 把儿 悬念 ：,Be not troubled for your child !
自古 穷通 皆 有定 ，,"From of old our rising , falling"
离合 岂 无缘 ？,Was ordained ; so now this parting .
从今 分 两地 ，,Each in another land must be ;
各自 保平安 。,Each for himself must fend as best he may ;
奴 去 也 ， 莫 牵连 。,"Now I am gone , oh . do not weep for me !"
〔 乐中 悲 〕,Fifth Song : Grief Amidst Gladness
襁褓 中 ，,"While you still in cradle lay ,"
父母 叹 双亡 。,Both your parents passed away .
纵居 那 绮罗 丛 ，,"Though born to silken luxury ,"
谁知 娇养 ？,No warmth or kind indulgence came your way .
幸 生来 ， 英豪 阔大 宽宏 量 ，,"Yet yours was a generous , open-hearted nature ,"
从未 将 儿女 私情 ， 略 萦 心上 。,And never could be snared or soured By childish piques and envious passions -
好 一似 ， 霁月光风 耀玉堂 。,You were a crystal house by wind and moonlight scoured .
厮配 得 才貌 仙郎 ，,"Matched to a perfect , gentle husband ,"
博得 个 地久天长 。,"Security of bliss at last it seemed ,"
准折 得 幼年 时 坎坷 形状 。,And all your childish miseries redeemed .
终久 是 云散高 唐 ，,"But soon alas ! the clouds of Gao-tang faded ,"
水涸 湘江 ：,The waters of the Xiang ran dry .
这 是 尘寰 中 消长 数 应当 ，,In our grey world so are things always ordered :
何必 枉 悲伤 ？,What then avails it to lament and sigh ?
〔 世 难容 〕,Sixth Song : All at Odds
气质 美如兰 ，,"Heaven made you like a flower ,"
才华 馥比 仙 。,"With grace and wit to match the gods ,"
天 生成 孤癖 人 皆 罕 。,"Adding a strange , contrary nature That set you with the rest at odds ."
你 道 是 啖 肉食 腥膻 ，,"Nauseous to you the world 's rank diet ,"
视 绮罗 俗厌 ；,Vulgar its fashion 's gaudy dress :
却 不知 好 高 人 愈妒 ，,But the world envies the superior
过洁世 同 嫌 。,And hates a too precious daintiness .
可叹 这 ， 青灯 古殿 人 将 老 ，,"Sad it seemed that your life should in dim-lit shrines be wasted ,"
孤负 了 ， 红粉 朱楼 春色 阑 ！,All the sweets of spring untasted :
到头来 ，,"Yet , at the last ,"
依旧 是 风尘肮脏 违心 愿 ；,"Down into mud and shame your hopes were cast ,"
好 一似 ， 无瑕 白玉 遭泥 陷 ；,"Like a white , flawless jade dropped in the muck ,"
又 何须 ， 王孙公子 叹 无缘 ？,Where only wealthy rakes might bless their luck .
〔 喜 冤家 〕,Seventh Song : Husband and Enemy
中山狼 ，,"Zhong-shan wolf ,"
无情 兽 。,"Inhuman sot ,"
全 不念 当日 根由 。,Who for past kindnesses cared not a jot !
一味 的 ， 骄奢 淫荡 贪欢 媾 。,"Bully and spend thrift , reckless in debauch , For riot or for whoring always hot !"
觑 着 那 ， 侯门艳 质同 蒲柳 ；,"A delicate young wife of gentle stock To you was no more than a lifeless block ,"
作践 的 ， 公府 千金 似 下流 。,"And bore , when you would rant and rave , Treatment far worse than any slave ;"
叹 芳魂 艳魄 ，,"So that her delicate , sweet soul"
一载 荡 悠悠 。,In just a twelvemonth from its body stole .
〔 虚花悟 〕,Eighth Song : The Vanity of Spring
将 那三春 看破 ，,"When triple spring as vanity was seen ,"
桃红柳绿 待 如何 ？,"What use the blushing flowers , the willows green ?"
把 这 韶华 打灭 ，,From youth 's extravagance you sought release
觅 那 清淡 天 和 。,To win chaste quietness and heavenly peace .
说 什么 天上 夭 桃 盛 ，,"The hymeneal peach-blooms in the sky ,"
云中 杏蕊 多 ？,The flowering almond 's blossoms seen on high
到头来 ，,
谁 见 把 秋 捱过 ？,"Dismiss , since none , for sure , Can autumn 's blighting frost endure ."
则 看 那 ，,
白杨 村里人 呜咽 ，,"Amidst sad aspens mourners sob and sigh ,"
青 枫林 下 鬼 吟哦 。,"In maple woods the poor ghosts thinly cry ,"
更 兼 着 ， 连天 衰草 遮 坟墓 ，,And under the dead grasslands lost graves lie .
这 的 是 ， 昨 贫 今 富人 劳碌 ，,"Now poor , now rich , men 's lives in toil are passed"
春 荣秋谢 花 折磨 。,"To be , like summer 's pride , cut down at last ."
似 这般 ， 生关死劫 谁 能 躲 ？,The doors of life and death all must go through .
闻 说道 ，,Yet this I know is true :
西方 宝树唤 婆娑 ，,In Paradise there grows a precious tree
上结 着 长生果 。,Which bears the fruit of immortality .
〔 聪明 累 〕,Ninth Song : Caught By Her Own Cunning
机关算尽太聪明 ，,"Too shrewd by half , with such finesse you wrought"
反 算了 卿卿 性命 ！,That your own life in your own toils was caught ;
生前 心 已 碎 ，,"But long before you died your heart was slain ,"
死 后性 空灵 。,And when you died your spirit walked in vain .
家 富人 宁 ；,"Fall ' n the great house once so secure in wealth ,"
终 有 个 ， 家 亡 人 散 各 奔腾 。,Each scattered member shifting for himself ;
枉费 了意 悬 悬 半世 心 ，,And half a life-time 's anxious schemes
好 一似 ， 荡 悠悠 三 更 梦 。,Proved no more than the stuff of dreams .
忽喇喇 似 大厦 倾 ，,"Like a great building 's tottering crash ,"
昏惨惨 似 灯 将 尽 。,"Like flickering lampwick burned to ash ,"
呀 ！ 一场 欢喜 忽 悲辛 。,Your scene of happiness concludes in grief
叹 人世 ， 终 难定 ！,For worldly bliss is always insecure and brief .
〔 留 余庆 〕,Tenth Song : The Survivor
留 余庆 ，,"Some good remained ,"
留 余庆 ，,Some good remained :
忽 遇 恩人 ；,The daughter found a friend in need
幸 娘亲 ， 幸 娘亲 ， 积得 阴功 。,Through her mother 's one good deed .
劝 人生 ， 济困 扶 穷 。,"So let all men the poor and meek sustain ,"
休似 俺 那 爱 银钱 、 忘 骨肉 的狠 舅奸 兄 ！,"And from the example of her cruel kin refrain , Who kinship scorned and only thought of gain ."
正是 乘除 加减 ， 上 有 苍穹 。,For far above the constellations One watches all and makes just calculations .
〔 晚 韶华 〕,Eleventh Song : Splendour Come Late
镜 里 恩情 ，,"Favour , a shadow in the glass ;"
更 那堪梦 里 功名 ！,"Fame , a dream that soon would pass :"
那 美韶华 去 之何 迅 ！,"The blissful flowering-time of youth soon fled ,"
再 休 提 绣 帐鸳衾 。,"Soon , too , the pleasures of the bridal bed ."
只 这 戴珠冠 ， 披 凤 袄 ，,A pearl-encrusted crown and robes of state
也 抵 不了 无常 性命 。,Could not for death untimely compensate ;
虽说 是 ， 人生 莫 受 老 来 贫 ，,"And though each man desires Old age from want made free ,"
也 须要 阴鹭 积 儿孙 。,True blessedness requires A clutch of young heirs at the knee .
气昂昂 ，,Proudly upright
头戴 簪缨 ，,"The head with cap and bands of office on ,"
光灿灿 ，,And gleaming bright
胸 悬 金印 ，,Upon his breast the gold insignia shone .
威 赫赫 ，,An awesome sight
爵 禄高登 ，,To see him so exalted stand ! -
昏惨惨 ，,Yet the black night
黄泉路 近 ！,Of death 's dark frontier lay close at hand .
问 古来 将相 可 还 存 ？,All those whom history calls great
也 只是 虚名 儿 后人 钦敬 。,Left only empty names for us to venerate .
〔 好事 终 〕,Twelfth Song : The Good Things Have An End
画 梁春尽 落 香生 。,Perfumed was the dust that fell From painted beams where springtime ended .
擅 风情 ，,Her sportive heart
秉 月貌 ，,And amorous looks
便是 败家 的 根本 。,The ruin of a mighty house portended .
箕裘 颓 堕 皆 从 敬 ，,The weakness in the line began with Jing ;
家事 消亡 首 罪 宁 。,The blame for the decline lay first in Ning ;
宿孽 总因 情 ！,But retribution all was of Love 's fashioning .
〔 飞鸟 各 投林 〕,Epilogue : The Birds Into The Wood Have Flown
为官 的 ， 家业 雕 零 ；,"The office jack 's career is blighted ,"
富贵 的 ， 金银 散尽 ；,"The rich man 's fortune now all vanished ,"
有恩 的 ， 死里逃生 ；,"The kind with life have been requited ,"
无情 的 ， 分明 报应 ；,The cruel exemplarily punished ;
欠命 的 ， 命 已 还 ；,"The one who owed a life is dead ,"
欠泪 的 ， 泪 已尽 ：,The tears one owed have all been shed .
冤冤相报 自 非轻 ，,Wrongs suffered have the wrongs done expiated ;
分离 聚合 皆 前定 。,The couplings and the sunderings were fated .
欲 知命 短 问 前生 ，,"Untimely death sin in some past life shows ,"
老 来 富贵 也 真 侥幸 。,But only luck a blest old age bestows .
看破 的 ， 遁入空门 ；,"The disillusioned to their convents fly ,"
痴迷 的 ， 枉 送 了 性命 。,The still deluded miserably die .
— — 好 一似食尽鸟 投林 ，,"Like birds who , having fed , to the woods repatr ,"
落 了 片 白茫茫 大地 真 干净 ！,They leave the landscape desolate and bare .
歌 毕 ， 还 又 歌 副歌 。,"Having reached the end of this suite , the singers showed signs of embarking on another one ."
警幻 见 宝玉 甚 无 趣味 ， 因 叹 ： “ 痴儿 竟 尚未 悟 ！ ”,"Disenchantment observed with a sigh that Bao-yu was dreadfully bored . ' Silly boy ! You still do not understand , do you ? '"
那宝玉 忙止 歌姬 不必 再 唱 ， 自觉 朦胧 恍惚 ， 告醉 求卧 。,Bao-yu hurriedly stopped the girls and told them that they need not sing any more . He felt dizzy and his head was spinning . He explained to Disenchantment that he had drunk too much and would like to lie down .
警幻 便命 撤去 残席 ， 送 宝玉 至 一 香闺绣阁 中 。,At once she ordered the remains of the feast to be removed and conducted Bao-yu to a dainty bedroom .
其间 铺陈 之盛 ， 乃 素所未见之物 。,The furnishings and hangings of the bed were more sumptuous and beautiful than anything he had ever seen .
更 可骇 者 ， 早 有 一位 仙 姬 在内 ， 其 鲜艳 妩媚 ， 大 似 宝钗 ； 袅娜 风流 ， 又 如 黛玉 。,"To his intense surprise there was a fairy girl sitting in the middle of it . Her rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of Bao-chai , but there was also something about her of Dai-yu 's delicate charm ."
正 不知 是 何意 ， 忽见 警幻 说道 ： “ 尘世 中 多少 富贵 之 家 ， 那些 绿窗 风月 ， 绣阁 烟霞 ， 皆 被 那些 淫 污 纨绔 与 流荡 女子 玷辱 了 ；,"As he was pondering the meaning of this apparition , he suddenly became aware that Disenchantment was addressing him . ' In the rich and noble households of your mortal world , too many of those bowers and boudoirs where innocent tenderness and sweet girlish fantasy should reign are injuriously defiled by coarse young voluptuaries and loose , wanton girls ."
更 可恨 者 ， 自古 来 ， 多少 轻薄 浪子 ， 皆 以 ‘ 好色 不淫 ’ 为 解 ， 又 以 ‘ 情而不淫 ’ 作案 ， 此 皆 饰非掩丑 之 语 耳 ： 好色 即 淫 ， 知情 更 淫 。,"And what is even more detestable , there are always any number of worthless philanderers to protest that it is woman 's beauty alone that inspires them , or loving feelings alone , unsullied by any taint of lust . They lie in their teeth !"
是 以 巫山 之会 ， 云雨 之欢 ， 皆由既悦其色 、 复恋 其 情 所致 。,"To be moved by woman 's beauty is itself a kind of lust . To experience loving feelings is , even more assuredly , a kind of lust . Every act of love , every carnal congress of the sexes is brought about precisely because sensual delight in beauty has kindled the feeling of love ."
— — 吾 所 爱汝者 ， 乃 天下 古今 第一 淫 人 也 ！ ”,' The reason I like you so much is because you are full of lust . You are the most lustful person I have ever known in the whole world !
宝玉 听 了 ， 唬 的 慌忙 答道 ： “ 仙姑 差 了 ： 我 因 懒于 读书 ， 家 父母 尚每 垂 训饬 ， 岂敢 再 冒 ‘ 淫 ’ 字 ？,"Bao-yu was scared by the vehemence of her words . ' Madam Fairy , you are wrong ! Because I am lazy over my lessons , Mother and Father still have to scold me quite often ; but surely that does not make me lustful ?"
况且 年纪 尚幼 ， 不知 ‘ 淫 ’ 何事 。 ”,"I am still too young to know what they do , the people they use that word about . '"
警幻 道 ： “ 非 也 。,"' Ah , but you are lustful ! ' said Disenchantment ."
淫 虽 一理 ， 意则 有别 。,"' In principle , of course , all lust is the same . But the word has many different meanings ."
如世 之 好 淫者 ， 不过 悦 容貌 ， 喜 歌舞 ， 调笑 无厌 ， 云雨 无 时 ， 恨不能 天下 之 美女 供 我 片时 之 趣 兴 ：,"For example , the typically lustful man in the common sense of the word is a man who likes a pretty face , who is fond of singing and dancing , who is inordinately given to flirtation ; one who makes love in season and out of season , and who , if he could , would like to have every pretty girl in the world at his disposal , to gratify his desires whenever he felt like it ."
此 皆 皮肤 滥淫 之 蠢物 耳 。,"Such a person is a mere brute . His is a shallow , promiscuous kind of lust ."
如尔 则 天分 中 生成 一段 痴情 ， 吾辈 推之为 ‘ 意淫 ’ 。,"' But your kind of lust is different . That blind , defenceless love with which nature has filled your being is what we call here "" lust of the mind "" ."
惟 ‘ 意淫 ’ 二 字 ， 可 心会 而 不可 口传 ， 可 神通 而 不能 语达 。,""" Lust of the mind "" can not be explained in words , nor , if it could , would you be able to grasp their meaning . Either you know what it means or you do not ."
汝 今 独得 此 二 字 ， 在 闺阁 中 虽可为 良友 ， 却 于 世道 中 未免 迂阔 怪 诡 ， 百口 嘲谤 ， 万目睚眦 。,"' Because of this "" lust of the mind "" women will find you a kind and understanding friend ; but in the eyes of the world I am afraid it is going to make you seem unpractical and eccentric . It is going to earn you the jeers of many and the angry looks of many more ."
今 既 遇 尔祖 宁荣二 公 剖腹 深嘱 ， 吾 不忍 子 独为 我 闺阁 增光 而 见弃 于 世道 ， 故 引子 前来 ， 醉 以 美酒 ， 沁 以 仙 茗 ， 警以 妙曲 ， 再 将 吾 妹 一 人 ， 乳名 兼 美 表字 可 卿 者 ， 许配 与 汝 。,"' Today I received a most touching request on your behalf from your ancestors the Duke of Ning-guo and the Duke of Rong-guo . And as I can not bear the idea of your being rejected by the world for the greater glory of us women , I have brought you here . I have made you drunk with fairy wine . I have drenched you with fairy tea . I have admonished you with fairy songs . And now I am going to give you my little sister Two-in-one - "" Ke-qing "" to her friends - to be your bride ."
今夕 良时 ， 即可 成姻 ：,' The time is propitious . You may consummate the marriage this very night .
不过 令汝 领略 此 仙 闺 幻境 之 风光 尚然 如此 ， 何况 尘世 之 情景 呢 。,"My motive in arranging this is to help you grasp the fact that , since even in these immortal precincts love is an illusion , the love of your dust-stained , mortal world must be doubly an illusion ."
从 今后 ， 万万 解释 ， 改悟 前情 ， 留意 于 孔孟 之间 ， 委身 于 经济 之 道 。 ”,"It is my earnest hope that , knowing this , you will henceforth be able to shake yourself free of its entanglements and change your previous way of thinking , devoting your mind seriously to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and your person wholeheartedly to the betterment of society . '"
说 毕 ， 便秘 授 以 云雨 之 事 ， 推 宝玉 入 房中 ， 将门 掩上 自去 。,"Disenchantment then proceeded to give him secret instructions in the art of love ; then , pushing him gently inside the room , she closed the door after him and went away ."
那宝玉 恍恍惚惚 ， 依着 警幻 所 嘱 ， 未免 作起 儿女 的 事 来 ， 也 难以 尽述 。,"Dazed and confused , Bao-yu nevertheless proceeded to follow out the instructions that Disenchantment had given him , which led him by predictable stages to that act which boys and girls perform together - and which it is not my intention to give a full account of here ."
至 次日 ， 便 柔情 缱绻 ， 软语 温存 ， 与 可 卿 难解难分 。,"Next morning he lay for a long time locked in blissful tenderness with Ke-qing , murmuring sweet endearments in her ear and unable to tear himself away from her ."
因 二人 携手 出去 游玩 之 时 ， 忽然 至 一个 所在 ， 但 见 荆 榛 遍地 ， 狼 虎 同行 ， 迎面 一道 黑溪 阻路 ， 并 无 桥梁 可通 。,Eventually they emerged from the bedroom hand in hand to walk together out-of-doors . Their walk seemed to take them quite suddenly to a place where only thorn-trees grew and wolves and tigers prowled around in pairs . Ahead of them the road ended at the edge of a dark ravine . No bridge connected it with the other side .
正在 犹豫 之间 ， 忽见 警幻 从后 追来 ， 说道 ： “ 快 休 前进 ， 作速 回头 要紧 ！ ”,"As they hesitated , wondering what to do , they suddenly became aware that Disenchantment was running up behind them . ' Stop ! Stop ! ' she was shouting . ' Turn back at once ! Turn back ! '"
宝玉 忙 止步 问道 “ 此 系 何处 ？ ”,Bao-yu stood still in alarm and asked her what place this was .
警幻 道 ： “ 此 乃 迷津 ， 深 有 万丈 ， 遥亘 千里 ， 中 无 舟楫 可通 ， 只有 一个 木筏 ， 乃 木 居士 掌 柁 ， 灰 侍者 撑篙 ， 不 受 金银 之 谢 ， 但 遇 有缘 者 渡 之 。,"' This is the Ford of Error , ' said Disenchantment . ' It is ten thousand fathoms deep and extends hundreds of miles in either direction . No boat can ever cross it ; only a raft manned by a lay-brother called Numb and an acolyte called Dumb . Numb holds the steering-paddle and Dumb wields the pole . They will not ferry anyone across for money , but only take those who are fated to cross over ."
尔 今 偶 游 至此 ， 设如 坠落 其中 ， 便 深 负 我 从前 谆谆 警戒 之 语 了 。 ”,"' If you had gone on walking just now and had fallen in , all the good advice I was at such pains to give you would have been wasted ! '"
话 犹 未了 ， 只 听 迷津 内响 如 雷声 ， 有 许多 夜叉 海鬼 ， 将 宝玉 拖 将 下去 ， 吓 得 宝玉 汗 下 如 雨 ， 一面 失声 喊叫 ： “ 可 卿 救 我 ！ ”,"Even as she spoke there was a rumbling like thunder from inside the abyss and a multitude of demons and water monsters reached up and clutched at Bao-yu to drag him down into its depths . In his terror the sweat broke out over his body like rain and a great cry burst from his lips , ' Ke-qing ! Save me ! '"
吓 得 袭 人 辈 众 丫鬟 忙 上来 搂住 ， 叫 ： “ 宝玉 不怕 ， 我们 在 这里 呢 。 ”,"Aroma and his other maids rushed up in alarm and clung to him . ' Do not be frightened , Bao-yu ! We are here ! '"
却说 秦氏 正在 房外 嘱咐 小丫头 们 好生 看着 猫儿 狗儿 打架 ， 忽闻 宝玉 在 梦 中 唤 他 的 小名儿 ， 因 纳闷 道 ： “ 我 的 小名儿 这里 从 无人 知道 ， 他 如何 得知 ， 在 梦 中 叫 出来 ？ ”,"But Qin-shi , who was out in the courtyard telling the maids to be sure that the cats and dogs did not fight , marvelled to hear him call her name out in his sleep . ' "" Ke-qing "" was the name they called me back at home when I was a little girl . Nobody here knows it . I wonder how he could have found it out ? '"
未知 何 因 ， 下回分解 。,"If you have not yet fathomed the answer to her question , you must read the next chapter ."
第六回,Chapter 6
贾宝玉 初试 云雨 情,Jia Bao-yu conducts his first experiment in the Art of Love
刘老老 一 进 荣国府,And Grannie Liu makes her first entry into the Rong-guo mansion
却说 秦氏 因 听见 宝玉 梦中唤 他 的 乳名 ， 心中 纳闷 ， 又 不好 细问 。,"Qin-shi was surprised to hear Bao-yu call out her childhood name in his sleep , but did not like to pursue the matter ."
彼时 宝玉 迷 迷惑 惑 ， 若有所失 ， 遂 起身 解怀 整衣 ， 袭 人 过来 给 他 系 裤带 时 ， 刚 伸手 至 大腿 处 ， 只 觉 冰冷 粘湿 的 一片 ， 吓 的 忙 褪 回手 来 ， 问 ： “ 是 怎么 了 ？ ”,"As she stood wondering , Bao-yu , who was still bemused after his dream and not yet in full possession of his faculties , got out of bed and began to stretch himself and to adjust his clothes , assisted by Aroma . As she was doing up his trousers , her hand , chancing to stray over his thigh , came into contact with something cold and sticky which caused her to draw it back in alarm and ask him if he was all right ."
宝玉 红了脸 ， 把 他 的 手 一 捻 ， 袭 人本 是 个 聪明 女子 ， 年纪 又 比 宝玉 大 两岁 ， 近来 也渐 省 人事 ， 今 见 宝玉 如此 光景 ， 心中 便 觉察 了 一半 ， 不觉 把 个 粉脸 羞 的 飞红 ， 遂 不好 再 问 。,"Instead of answering , he merely reddened and gave the hand a squeeze . Aroma had always been an intelligent girl . She was , in any case , a year or two older than Bao-yu and had recently begun to have some understanding of the facts of life . Observing the condition that Bao-yu was in , she therefore had more than an inkling of what had happened . Abandoning her question , she busied herself with his clothes , her cheeks suffused by a crimson blush of embarrassment ."
仍旧 理 好 衣裳 ， 随至 贾母 处来 ， 胡乱 吃 过 晚饭 ， 过 这边 来 ， 趁 众 奶娘 丫鬟 不在 旁时 ， 另 取出 一件 中衣 ， 与 宝玉 换上 。,"When he was properly dressed , they went to rejoin Grandmother Jia and the rest . There they bolted a hurried supper and then slipped back to the other house , where Aroma profited from the absence of the nurses and the other maids to take out a clean undergarment for Bao-yu to change into ."
宝玉 含羞 央告 道 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 千万别 告诉 人 。 ”,"' Please , Aroma , ' Bao-yu shamefacedly entreated as she helped him change , ' please do not tell anyone ! '"
袭 人 也 含 着 羞 悄悄的 笑 问道 ： “ 你 为什么 … … ” 说 到 这里 ， 把 眼 又 往 四下里 瞧 了 瞧 ， 才 又 问道 ： “ 那 是 那里 流 出来 的 ？ ”,"Equally ill at ease , Aroma giggled softly . ' Why did you . . . ' she began to ask . Then , after glancing cautiously around , began again . ' Where did that stuff come from ? '"
宝玉 只管 红着脸 不 言语 ， 袭 人 却 只 瞅 着 他 笑 ， 迟 了 一会 ， 宝玉 才 把 梦 中 之 事 细说 与 袭 人 听 。,Bao-yu blushed furiously and said nothing . Aroma stared at him curiously and continued to giggle . After much hesitation he proceeded to give her a detailed account of his dream .
说 到 云雨 私情 ， 羞 的 袭 人 掩面 伏身 而 笑 。,"But when he came to the part of it in which he made love to Two-in-one , Aroma threw herself forward with a shriek of laughter and buried her face in her hands ."
宝玉 亦素喜 袭 人 柔媚 姣俏 ， 遂 强 拉 袭 人 同 领警 幻所 训之事 。,"Bao-yu had long been attracted by Aroma 's somewhat coquettish charms and tugged at her purposefully , anxious to share with her the lesson he had learned from Disenchantment ."
袭 人 自知 贾母 曾 将 他 给 了 宝玉 ， 也 无可 推托 的 ， 扭捏 了 半日 ， 无奈何 ， 只得 和 宝玉 温存 了 一番 。,"Aroma knew that when Grandmother Jia gave her to Bao-yu she had intended her to belong to him in the fullest possible sense , and so , having no good reason for refusing him , she allowed him , after a certain amount of coy resistance , to have his way with her ."
自此 宝玉 视 袭 人 更自 不同 ， 袭 人 待 宝玉 也 越发 尽职 了 。,"From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before , whilst Aroma for her part redoubled the devotion with which she served him ."
这话 暂且 不 提 。,"But of this , for the time being , no more ."
且说 荣府 中 合算 起来 ， 从 上 至 下 ， 也 有 三百余 口人 ， 一天 也 有 一二十件 事 ， 竟 如 乱麻 一般 ， 没 个 头绪 可 作 纲领 。,"The inhabitants of the Rong mansion , if we include all of them from the highest to the humblest in our total , numbered more than three hundred souls , who produced between them a dozen or more incidents in a single day . Faced with so exuberant an abundance of material , what principle should your chronicler adopt to guide him in his selection of incidents to record ?"
正思 从 那 一件 事 那 一个 人 写起 方妙 ？ 却 好 忽 从 千里 之外 ， 芥豆 之 微 ， 小小 一个 人家 ， 因 与 荣府 略 有些 瓜葛 ， 这日 正 往 荣府 中 来 ， 因此 便 就 这 一家 说起 ， 倒 还是 个 头绪 。,"As we pondered the problem where to begin , it was suddenly solved for us by the appearance as it were out of nowhere of someone from a very humble , very insignificant household who , on the strength of a very tenuous , very remote family connection with the Jias , turned up at the Rong mansion on the very day of which we are about to write ."
原来 这 小小 之 家 ， 姓 王 ， 乃 本地 人氏 ， 祖上 也 做 过 一个 小小 京官 ， 昔年 曾 与 凤姐 之 祖 王夫人 之 父 认识 。,"Their name was Wang and they were natives of these parts . A grandfather had held some very small official post in the capital and had there become acquainted with Wang Xi-feng 's grandfather , the father of Lady Wang ."
因 贪 王家 的 势利 ， 便连 了 宗 ， 认作 侄儿 。,"Conceiving an admiration for the power and prestige of this greater namesake , he had sought to link his family with the latter 's clan by becoming his adoptive nephew ."
那时 只有 王夫人 之 大兄 凤姐 之 父 与 王夫人 随 在 京 的 知有 此 一门 远族 ， 余者 也 皆 不知 。,"Only Lady Wang and her elder brother - Wang Xi-feng 's father - who chanced at that time to be staying with their parent on his tour of duty at the capital , knew anything about this . The other members of the clan were unaware that any such relationship existed ."
目今 其 祖 早 故 ， 只有 一个 儿子 ， 名唤 王成 ， 因 家业 萧条 ， 仍 搬出 城外 乡村 中 住 了 。,"The grandfather had long since died , leaving an only son called Wang Cheng who , having fallen on hard times , had moved back into the countryside somewhere outside the capital ."
王成 亦 相继 身故 ， 有子 小名 狗儿 ， 娶妻 刘氏 ， 生子 小名 板儿 ； 又 生一 女 ， 名唤 青儿 ：,"Wang Cheng in his turn had died leaving a son called Gou-er , who had married a girl from a family called Liu and now had two children , a son called Ban-er and a daughter called Qing-er ."
一家 四口 ， 以 务农 为 业 。,"The four of them depended on agriculture for their living , and since , with Gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and his wife busy about the farm drawing water , pounding grain , and the like , there was no one to look after Qing-er and her little brother ."
因 狗儿 白日 间 自作 些 生计 ， 刘氏 又 操 井臼 等 事 ， 青板 姊弟 两个 ， 无人 照管 ， 狗儿 遂 将 岳母 刘老老 接来 ， 一处 过活 。,"Gou-er invited his mother-in-law , old Grannie Liu , to come and live with them ."
这 刘老老 乃是 个 久经 世代 的 老 寡妇 ， 膝下 又 无子息 ， 只 靠 两亩 薄田 度日 。,"This Grannie Liu was an ancient widow-woman , rich in experience of the world , who , having no son or daughter-in-law to cherish her , eked out her solitary existence by scratching a livelihood from a miserable half-acre of land ."
如今 女婿 接 了 养活 ， 岂 不 愿意 呢 ， 遂 一心一计 ， 帮 着 女儿 女婿 过活 。,She therefore embraced her son-in-law 's invitation with alacrity and threw herself enthusiastically into the business of helping the young couple to make a living .
因 这年 秋尽冬 初 ， 天气 冷 将 上来 ， 家中 冬 事 未办 ， 狗儿 未免 心中 烦躁 ， 吃 了 几杯 闷酒 ， 在 家里 闲 寻 气恼 ， 刘氏 不敢 顶撞 。,"The season was now at the turn between autumn and winter . The cold weather was beginning , but none of the preparations for winter had yet been made . By drinking to allay his anxiety , Gou-er merely put himself more out of temper . He returned home to vent some of his spleen on his long-suffering wife ."
因此 刘老老 看 不过 ， 便 劝道 ： “ 姑爷 ， 你 别 嗔着 我 多嘴 ： 咱们 村庄 人家 儿 ， 那 一个 不是 老老实实 守 着 多 大碗 儿 吃 多 大 的 饭 呢 ！,"Grannie Liu could eventually stomach no more of his wife-baiting and intervened on her daughter 's behalf . ' Now look here , son-in-law : probably you will think me an interfering old woman ; but we country folk have to be grateful for what is in the pot and cut down our appetites to the same measure ."
你 皆 因 年 小时候 ， 托 着 老子 娘 的 福 ， 吃喝 惯 了 ， 如今 所以 有了钱 就 顾头不顾尾 ， 没了 钱 就 瞎 生气 ， 成 了 什么 男子汉 大丈夫 了 ！,"When you were little your Ma and Pa could afford to indulge you ; so now you are grown-up you spend all your money as soon as you have got any , without stopping to count the cost ; then , when its all gone , you start making a fuss . But what sort of way is that for a grown man to behave ?"
如今 咱们 虽 离 城 住 着 ， 终 是 天子 脚下 。 这 ‘ 长安 ’ 城中 ， 遍地 皆 是 钱 ， 只 可惜 没人会 去 拿 罢了 。,"' Now where we live may be out in the country , but it is still "" in the Emperor 's shadow "" , as they say Over there in the city the streets are paved with money just waiting for someone to go and pick it up ."
在家 跳蹋 也 没用 ！ ”,What is the sense in rampaging around here at home when you could go out and help yourself ? '
狗 儿 听 了 道 ： “ 你老 只 会 在 炕头 上 坐 着 混 说 ， 难道 叫 我 打劫 去不成 ？ ”,"' It is easy for you to sit on your backside and talk , said Gou-er rudely , ' but what do you expect me to do ? Go out and rob ? '"
刘老老 说道 ： “ 谁 叫 你 去 打劫 呢 ？,"' No one 's asking you to rob , ' said Grannie Liu ."
也 到底 大家 想个方法 儿 才 好 。,' But can not we all sit down peaceably and think of a way ?
不然 ， 那 银子 钱 会 自己 跑 到 咱们 家里 来 不成 ？ ”,"Because if we do not , the money is not going to come walking in the door of its own accord . '"
狗儿 冷笑 道 ： “ 有 法儿 还 等到 这 会子 呢 ！,"Gou-er snorted sarcastically . ' If there were a way , do you suppose I should have waited till now before trying it out ?"
我 又 没有 收税 的 亲戚 、 做官 的 朋友 ， 有 什么 法子 可想 的 ？,There are no tax-collectors in my family and no mandarins among my friends . What way could there be of laying my hands on some money ?
就 有 ， 也 只怕 他们 未必 来理 我们 呢 ！ ”,"Even if I did have rich friends or relations , I am not so sure they would want to be bothered with the likes of us . '"
刘老 老道 ： “ 这 倒 也 不然 。,"' I would not say that , ' said Grannie Liu ."
‘ 谋事在人 ， 成事在天 ’ ， 咱们 谋到 了 ， 靠 菩萨 的 保佑 ， 有些 机会 ， 也 未可知 。,"' Man proposes , God disposes . It is up to us to think of something . We must leave it to the good Lord to decide whether He will help us or not . Who knows , He might give us the opportunity we are looking for ."
我 倒替 你们 想 出 一个 机会 来 。,' Now I can think of a chance you might try .
当日 你们 原是 和 金陵 王家 连过 宗 的 。,Your family used to be connected with the Wang clan of Nanking .
二十年 前 ， 他们 看承 你们 还好 ， 如今 是 你们 拉 硬 屎 ， 不肯 去 就 和 他 ， 才 疏远 起来 。,Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very good to you folk . It is only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to approach them that they have become more distant with you .
想当初 我 和 女儿 还 去过 一遭 ， 他家 的 二 小姐 ， 着实 爽快 会 待人 的 ， 倒 不 拿 大 。,"' I can remember going to their house once with my daughter . The elder Miss Wang was a very straightforward young lady , very easy to get on with , and not at all high and mighty ."
如今 现 是 荣国府 贾二 老爷 的 夫人 ， 听见 他们 说 ， 如今 上 了 年纪 ， 越发 怜贫恤老 的 了 ， 又 爱 斋 僧 布施 。,She is now the wife of the younger of the two Sir Jias in the Rong mansion . They say that now she is getting on in years she is grown even more charitable and given to good works than she was as a girl .
如今 王府 虽 升 了 官儿 ， 只怕 二姑 太太 还认 的 咱们 ， 你 为什么 不 走动 走动 ？,Her brother has been promoted ; but I should not be surprised if she at least did not still remember us . Why do not you try your luck with her ?
或者 他 还 念旧 ， 有些 好处 也 未可知 。,"You never know , she might do something for you for the sake of old times ."
只要 他 发点 好心 ， 拔根 寒毛 比 咱们 的 腰 还 壮 呢 ！ ”,She only has to feel well disposed and a hair of her arm would be thicker than a man 's waist to poor folks like us ! '
刘氏 接口 道 ： “ 你老 说 的 好 。,"' That is all very well , Mother , ' put in Gou-er 's wife , ' but just take a look at us !"
你 我 这样 嘴脸 ， 怎么 好 到 他 门 上去 ？,What sort of state are we in to go calling on great folks like them ?
只怕 他 那 门上 人 也 不肯 进去 告诉 ， 没的白 打嘴 现世 的 ！ ”,I doubt the people at the door would bother to tell them we were there . Who is going to all that trouble just to make a fool of themselves ? '
谁知 狗 儿利 名心 重 ， 听 如此 说 ， 心下 便 有些 活动 ； 又 听 他 妻子 这番话 ， 便 笑 道 ：,"Gou-er 's cupidity , however , had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law , and his reaction to them was less discouraging than his wife 's ."
“ 老 老 既 这么 说 ， 况且 当日 你 又 见 过 这 姑 太太 一次 ， 为什么 不 你 老人家 明日 就 去 走一遭 ， 先 试试 风 头儿 去 ？ ”,"' Well , if it is as you say , Grannie , and being as you have already seen this lady , why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us ? '"
刘老 老道 ： “ 哎哟 ！,' Bless us and save us ! ' said Grannie Liu .
可是 说 的 了 ： ‘ 侯门似海 ’ ， 我 是 个 什么 东西 儿 ！,"' You know what they say : "" A prince 's door is like the deep sea . "" What sort of creature do you take me for ?"
他 家人 又 不 认得 我 ， 去 了 也 是 白跑 。 ”,The servants there do not know me ; it would be a journey wasted . '
狗 儿 道 ： “ 不妨 ， 我 教给 你个 法儿 。,"' That is no problem , ' said Gou-er . ' I will tell you what to do ."
你 竟 带 了 小 板儿 先去 找 陪房 周 大爷 ， 要 见 了 他 ， 就 有些 意思 了 。,"You take young Ban-er with you and ask for Old Zhou that stayed in service with your lady after she married . If you tell them you have come to see him , it will give you an excuse for the visit ."
这 周 大爷 先时 和 我 父亲 交 过 一桩 事 ， 我们 本 极好 的 。 ”,Old Zhou once entrusted a bit of business to my father . He used to be very friendly with us at one time . '
刘老 老道 ： “ 我 也 知道 。,"' I knew all about that , ' said Grannie Liu ."
只是 许多 时 不 走动 ， 知道 他 如今 是 怎样 ？,' But it is a long time since you had anything to do with him and hard to say how he may prove after all these years .
这 也 说不得 了 ！,Howsomever .
你 又 是 个 男人 ， 这么 个 嘴脸 ， 自然 去 不得 。 我们 姑娘 年轻 的 媳妇儿 ， 也 难 卖头卖脚 的 ， 倒 还是 舍 着 我 这 副 老脸 去 碰碰 。,"Being a man , you naturally can not go in your present pickle ; and a young married woman like my daughter can not go gallivanting around the countryside showing herself to everybody . But as my old face is tough enough to stand a slap or two , its up to me to go . So be it , then ."
果然 有 好处 ， 大家 也 有益 。 ”,"If any good does come of the visit , we shall all of us benefit . '"
当晚 计议 已 定 。,"And so , that very evening , the matter was settled ."
次日 天未明 时 ， 刘老老 便 起来 梳洗 了 ， 又 将 板儿 教 了 几句话 ， 五六岁 的 孩子 ， 听见 带 了 他 进城 逛去 ， 喜欢 的 无不 应承 。,"Next day Grannie Liu was up before dawn . As soon as she had washed and done her hair , she set about teaching Ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great house - an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough , as would any little boy of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city ."
于是 刘老老 带 了 板儿 ， 进城 至 宁荣街 来 。,"That done , she set off on her journey , and in due course made her way to Two Dukes Street ."
到 了 荣府 大 门前 石狮子 旁边 ， 只见 满 门口 的 轿马 。,"There , at each side of the stone lions which flanked the gates of the Rong Mansion , she saw a cluster of horses and palanquins ."
刘老老 不敢 过去 ， 掸 掸 衣服 ， 又 教 了 板儿 几句话 ， 然后 溜到 角 门前 ， 只见 几个 挺胸 叠 肚 ， 指手画脚 的 人 坐在 大门 上 ， 说东谈西 的 。,"Not daring to go straight up , she first dusted down her clothes and rehearsed Ban-er 's little repertoire of phrases before sidling up to one of the side entrances . A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gateway sunning their bellies and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics ."
刘老老 只得 蹭 上来 问 ： “ 太爷 们 纳福 。 ”,Grannie Liu waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation .
众人 打量 了 一会 ， 便 问 ： “ 是 那里 来 的 ？ ”,"After looking her up and down for a moment or two , they asked her her business ."
刘老老 陪笑 道 ： “ 我 找 太太 的 陪房 周 大爷 的 。,Grannie Liu smiled ingratiatingly . ' I have come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before she married .
烦 那位 太爷 替 我 请 他 出来 。 ”,Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me ? '
那些 人 听 了 ， 都 不理 他 ， 半日 ， 方 说道 ： “ 你 远远 的 那 墙 畸 角儿 等 着 ， 一会 子 他们 家里 就 有人 出来 。 ”,"The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion . After she had waited there for some considerable time one of them said , ' If you stand at that gate along there on the corner , someone from inside the house should be coming out presently '"
内中 有个 年老 的 说道 ： “ 何苦 误 他 的 事 呢 ？ ” 因 向 刘老 老道 ： “ 周 大爷 往 南边 去 了 。 他 在 后 一带 住 着 ， 他们 奶奶 儿 倒 在家 呢 。,"But a more elderly man among them protested that it was ' a shame to send her on a fool 's errand ' , and turning to Grannie Liu he said , ' Old Zhou is away in the South at the moment , but his missus is still at home . She lives round at the back ."
你 打 这边 绕到 后 街门 上找 就是 了 。 ”,You will have to go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there . '
刘老老 谢 了 ， 遂 领 着 板儿 绕 至 后门 上 ， 只见 门上 歇 着 些 生意 担子 ， 也 有 卖 吃 的 ， 也 有 卖 玩耍 的 ， 闹 吵吵 三二十个 孩子 在 那里 。,"Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted oft with little Ban-er all the way round to the rear entrance . There she found a number of sweetmeat vendors and toy-sellers who had set their wares down outside the gate and were being beseiged by a crowd of some twenty or thirty noisy , yelling children ."
刘老老 便 拉住 一个 道 ： “ 我 问 哥儿 一声 ： 有个 周大娘 在家 么 ？ ”,"She grabbed a small urchin from their midst and drew him towards her . ' Tell me , sonny , is there a Mrs Zhou living here ? '"
那 孩子 翻 眼瞅 着道 ： “ 那个 周大娘 ？,The urchin stared back at her impudently . ' Which Mrs Zhou ?
我们 这里 周大娘 有 几个 呢 ， 不知 那 一个 行 当儿 上 的 ？ ”,There are several Mrs Zhous here . What is her job ? '
刘老 老道 ： “ 他 是 太太 的 陪房 。 ”,' She is the Mrs Zhou that came here with Her Ladyship when she was married . '
那 孩子 道 ： “ 这个 容易 ， 你 跟 了 我 来 。 ”,"' That is easy , ' said the urchin . ' Follow me ! '"
引着 刘老老 进 了 后院 ， 到 一个 院子 墙边 ， 指道 ： “ 这 就是 他家 。 ” 又 叫 道 ： “ 周 大妈 ， 有个 老奶奶 子 找 你 呢 。 ”,"He led Grannie Liu into a rear courtyard . ' That is where she lives , ' he said , pointing in the direction of a side wall Then , bawling over the wall , ' Mrs Zhou , there is an old woman come to see you ! '"
周瑞家 的 在内 忙 迎 出来 ， 问 ： “ 是 那位 ？ ”,Zhou Ruis wife came hurrying out and asked who it was .
刘老老 迎上来 笑 问道 ： “ 好 啊 ？ 周嫂子 。 ”,"' How are you , my dear ? ' said Grannie Liu , advancing with a smile ."
周瑞家 的 认了 半日 ， 方笑 道 ： “ 刘老老 ， 你好 ？,"Zhou Rui 's wife scrutinized her questioningly for some moments before finally recognizing her . ' Why , it is Grannie Liu ! How are you ?"
你 说 么 ， 这 几年 不见 ， 我 就 忘 了 。,"It is so many years since I saw you last , I would forgotten all about you !"
请 家里 坐 。 ”,Come in and sit down ! '
刘老老 一面 走 ， 一面 笑 说道 ： “ 你老 是 ‘ 贵人多忘事 ’ 了 ， 那里 还 记得 我们 ？ ”,"Grannie Liu followed her cackling . ' You know what they say : "" Important people have short memories . "" I would not expect you to remember the likes of us ! '"
说 着 ， 来 至 房中 ， 周瑞家 的 命 雇 的 小丫头 倒 上 茶 来 吃 着 。,"When they were indoors , Zhou Rui 's wife ordered her little hired help to pour out some tea ."
周瑞家 的 又 问道 ： “ 板儿 长 了 这么 大 了 么 ！ ” 又 问 些 别 后 闲话 ， 又 问 刘老老 ： “ 今日 还是 路过 ， 还是 特来 的 ？ ”,"' And hasn ' t Ban-er grown a big boy ! ' said Zhou Rui 's wife ; then , after a few inquiries about the various things that had happened since they last met , she asked Grannie Liu about her visit . ' Were you just passing by , or have you come specially ? '"
刘老老 便 说 ： “ 原是 特来 瞧瞧 嫂子 ； 二则 也 请 请 姑 太太 的 安 。,"' Well , of course , first and foremost we came to see you , ' replied Grannie Liu mendaciously , ' but we were also hoping to pay our respects to Her Ladyship ."
若 可以 领 我 见 一 见 更好 ， 若 不能 ， 就 借重 嫂子 转 致意 罢了 ！ ”,"If you could take us to see her , that would be very nice ; but if that is not possible , perhaps we could trouble you just to give her our regards . '"
周瑞家 的 听 了 ， 便 已 猜 着 几分 来意 。 只 因 他 丈夫 昔年 争买 田地 一事 ， 多 得 狗 儿 他 父亲 之 力 ， 今 见 刘老老 如此 ， 心中 难 却 其意 ；,"From the tone of this reply Zhou Rui 's wife was already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman ' ' s visit ; but because some years previously her husband had received a lot of help from Gou-er 's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land , she could not very well reject Grannie Liu now , when she came to her as a suppliant ."
二则 也 要 显弄 自己 的 体面 。,"She was , in any case , anxious to demonstrate her own importance in the Jia household ; and so the answer she gave her was a gracious one ."
便 笑 说 ： “ 老 老 你 放心 。,"' Do not you worry , Grannie !"
大远 的 诚心诚意 来 了 ， 岂 有 个 不 叫 你 见 个 真佛 儿 去 的 呢 ？,"After you have made such a long pilgrimage , we will not let you go home without seeing a real Buddha !"
论理 ， 人 来客 至 ， 却 都 不 与 我 相干 。,"By rights , of course , Callers and Visitors has nothing to do with me ."
我们 这里 都 是 各 一样 儿 ：,"You see , we each have our own jobs here ."
我们 男 的 只管 春秋 两季 地租 子 ， 闲 了 时 带 着 小 爷们 出门 就 完 了 ；,"My man 's is collecting the half-yearly rents in the spring and autumn ; and when he is not doing that , he takes the young masters out when they go on visits . That is all he ever does ."
我 只管 跟 太太 奶奶 们 出门 的 事 。,Now my job is to attend to their ladyships and the young mistresses when they go out .
皆 因 你 是 太太 的 亲戚 ， 又 拿 我 当 个人 ， 投奔 了 我 来 ， 我 竟 破 个例 给 你 通 个 信儿 去 。,"But being as how you are a relation of Her Ladyship , and since you have put your confidence in me and turned to me to help you I do not mind breaking the rules for once and taking in a message ."
— — 但 只 一件 ， 你 还 不 知道 呢 ！ 我们 这里 不 比 五年 前 了 ， 如今 太太 不 理事 ， 都 是 琏 二 奶奶 当家 。,"' There is only one thing , though . I do not expect you know , but things here are very different from what they were five years ago . Nowadays Her Ladyship does not run things here any longer . It is Master Lian 's wife who does all the managing -"
你 打量 琏 二 奶奶 是 谁 ？,You will never guess who that is :
就是 太太 的 内 侄女儿 ， 大舅 老爷 的 女孩儿 ， 小名儿 叫 凤哥 的 。 ”,"Her Ladyship 's niece Wang Xi-feng . You know , Her Ladyship 's eldest brother 's daughter , that we used to call ' Feng-ge ' when she was a child . '"
［ 刘老老 听 了 ， 忙 问道 ： “ 原来 是 他 ？,
怪 道 呢 ， 我 当日 就 说 他 不错 。,
这么 说 起来 ， 我 今儿 还 得 见 他 了 ？ ”,
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 这个 自然 ， 如今 有 客 来 ， 都 是 凤姑娘 周旋 接待 ， 今儿 宁可 不见 太太 ， 倒 得 见 他 一面 ， 才 不枉 走 这 一遭 儿 。 ” ］,
刘老 老道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！ 这 全仗 嫂子 方便 了 。 ”,"' Bless you , my dear , for being such a help ! ' said Grannie Liu ."
周瑞家 的 说 ： “ 老 老 说 那里 话 ？,"' Oh Grannie , how can you say such a thing ? ' said Zhou Rui 's wife demurely ."
俗语说 的 好 ： ‘ 与人方便 ， 自己 方便 。 ’,"' You know what the old saying is , "" He who helps others helps himself . """
不过 用 我 一句 话 ， 又 费 不着 我 什么 事 。 ”,It is only a question of saying a few words . No trouble at all . '
说 着 ， 便 唤 小丫头 到 倒 厅 儿 上 悄悄的 打听 老太太 屋里 摆 了 饭 了 没有 。,"So saying , she instructed the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old Lady Jia is quarters and ask if they were serving lunch yet ."
小丫头 去 了 。 这里 二人 又 说 了 些 闲话 。,The little maid departed on her errand and the two women resumed their conversation .
刘老老 因说 ： “ 这位 凤姑娘 ， 今年 不过 十八九岁 罢了 ， 就 这 等 有 本事 ， 当 这样 的 家 ， 可是 难得 的 ！ ”,"' This Mrs Lian , said Grannie Liu : ' she can not be more than eighteen or nineteen years old . She must be a very capable young woman . Fancy her being able to run a great household like this ! '"
周瑞家 的 听 了 道 ： “ 瞎 ！ 我 的 老 老 ， 告诉 不得 你 了 ！,"' Oh Grannie , you have no idea ! ' said Zhou Rui 's wife ."
这 凤姑娘 年纪 儿 虽 小 ， 行 事儿 比 是 人 都 大 呢 。,"' Mrs Lian may be young , but when it comes to doing things , she is got an older head on her shoulders than any I have ever come across ."
如今 出 挑 的 美人儿 似的 ， 少 说 着 只怕 有 一万 心眼 子 ， 再要 赌 口齿 ， 十个 会 说 的 男人 也 说 不过 他 呢 ！,"She is grown up to be a real beauty too , has Mrs Lian . But sharp ! Well , if it ever comes to a slanging match , she can talk down ten grown men any day of the week !"
回来 你 见 了 就 知道 了 。,"Wait till you meet her , and you will see what I mean ."
— — 就 只 一件 ， 待 下 人 未免太 严 些 儿 。 ”,"There is only one thing , though . She is a bit too strict with those beneath her . '"
说 着 ， 小丫头 回来 说 ： “ 老太太 屋里 摆完 了 饭 了 ， 二 奶奶 在 太太 屋里 呢 。 ”,"As she was speaking , the little maid came back , her errand completed . ' They have finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship 's . Mrs Lian is with Her Ladyship . '"
周瑞家 的 听 了 ， 连忙 起身 催 着 刘老老 ： “ 快 走 ， 这一下 来 就 只 吃饭 是 个 空儿 ， 咱们 先 等 着 去 。,Zhou Rui 's wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise . ' Quick ! After she comes out from there she will be free for a few minutes while she has her meal . We must try and catch her then .
若 迟 了 一步 ， 回事 的 人 多 了 ， 就 难说 了 。,"If we delay a moment longer , people will start coming in with messages and we shall not have a chance to speak to her ."
再 歇 了 中觉 ， 越发 没 时候 了 。 ”,"And once she goes off for her afternoon nap , we have really lost her ! '"
说 着 ， 一齐 下 了 炕 ， 整顿 衣服 ， 又 教 了 板儿 几句话 ， 跟着 周瑞家 的 ， 逶迤 往 贾琏 的 住宅 来 。,"Grannie Liu got off the kang , adjusted her clothing , conducted Ban-er through a rapid revision of his little stock of phrases and followed Zhou Rui 's wife through various twists and turns to Jia Lian 's quarters ."
先至 倒 厅 ， 周瑞家 的 将 刘老老 安插 住 等 着 ， 自己 却先 过 影壁 ， 走进 了 院门 ， 知 凤姐 尚未 出来 ， 先 找 着 凤姐 的 一个 心腹 通房 大 丫头 名唤 平儿 的 ；,"Just before they reached them , Zhou Rui 's wife planted them both in a covered passage-way while she went on ahead round the screen wall and into the gate of the courtyard ."
周瑞家 的 先将 刘老老 起初 来历 说明 ， 又 说 ： “ 今日 大远 的 来 请安 ， 当日 太太 是 常会 的 ， 所以 我 带 了 他 过来 。,"First ascertaining that Wang Xi-feng had not yet left Lady Jia 's , she sought out Xi-feng 's chambermaid and principal confidante , Patience , and primed her with a full account of Grannie Liu is antecedents . ' She has come all this way today to pay her respects , ' she concluded . ' At one time Her Ladyship used to see quite a lot of her , which is why I thought it would be in order for me to bring her in ."
等 着 奶奶 下来 ， 我 细细 儿 的 回明 了 ， 想来 奶奶 也 不至 嗔着 我 莽撞 的 。 ”,I thought I would wait for the young mistress to come back and explain it all to her . I hope she will not be angry with me for pushing myself forward . '
平儿 听 了 ， 便 作 了 个 主意 ： “ 叫 他们 进来 ， 先 在 这里 坐 着 就是 了 。 ”,Patience at once made up her mind what to do . ' Let them come in here . They can sit here while they are waiting . '
周瑞家 的 才 出去 领 了 他们 进来 。,Zhou Rui 's wife went off again to fetch her charges .
上 了 正房 台阶 ， 小丫头 打 起 猩红 毡帘 ， 才 入 堂屋 ， 只 闻 一阵 香 扑 了 脸 来 ， 竟 不知 是 何 气味 ， 身子 就 象 在 云端 里 一般 。,"As they ascended the steps to the main reception room , a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portiére for them to enter . A strange , delicious fragrance seemed to reach forward and enfold them as they entered , producing in Grannie Liu the momentary sensation that she had been transported bodily to one of the celestial paradises ."
满 屋里 的 东西 都 是 耀眼 争光 ， 使 人 头晕目眩 ， 刘老老 此时 只有 点头咂嘴 念佛 而已 。,"Their eyes , too , were dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room . Temporarily speechless with wonder , Grannie Liu stood wagging her head , alternating clicks of admiration with pious ejaculations ."
于是 走 到 东边 这 间 屋里 ， 乃是 贾琏 的 女儿 睡觉 之所 。,From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in which Jia Lian is baby daughter slept .
平儿 站 在 炕沿 边 ， 打量 了 刘老老 两眼 ， 只得 问 个 好 ， 让 了 坐 。,"Patience , who was standing by the edge of the kang , made a rapid assessment of Grannie Liu and judged it sufficient to greet her with a civil ' how-do-you-do ' and an invitation to be seated ."
刘老老 见 平儿 遍身 绫罗 ， 插 金戴银 ， 花容月貌 ， 便当 是 凤姐儿 了 ， 才 要 称 “ 姑奶奶 ” ， 只见 周瑞家 的 说 ： “ 他 是 平 姑娘 。 ”,"Grannie Liu looked at the silks and satins in which Patience was dressed , the gold and silver ornaments in her hair , her beauty of feature which in every respect corresponded with what she had been told of Wang Xi-feng , and taking the maid for the mistress , was on the point of greeting her as ' Gou-er 's aunt ' , when Zhou Rui 's wife introduced her as ' Miss Patience ' ."
又 见 平儿 赶着 周瑞家 的 叫 他 “ 周大娘 ” ， 方知 不过 是 个 有 体面 的 丫头 。,"Then , when Patience shortly afterwards addressed Zhou Rui 's wife as ' Mrs Zhou ' , she knew that this was no mistress but a very high-class maid ."
于是 让 刘老老 和 板儿 上 了 炕 ， 平儿 和 周瑞家 的 对面 坐在 炕沿 上 ， 小丫头 们 倒 了 茶 来 吃 了 。,"So Grannie Liu and Ban-er got up on the kang at one side , while Patience and Zhou Rui 's wife sat near the edge of it on the other , and a little maid came in and poured them all some tea ."
刘老老 只 听见 咯当 咯当 的 响声 ， 很似 打罗 筛面 的 一般 ， 不免 东瞧西望 的 ， 忽 见 堂屋 中 柱子 上 挂 着 一个 匣子 ， 底下 又 坠 着 一个 秤 铭 似的 ， 却 不住 的 乱晃 ， 刘老老 心中 想着 ： “ 这 是 什么 东西 ？ 有 煞 用处 呢 ？ ”,"Grannie Liu 's attention was distracted by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike the sound made by a flour-bolting machine , and she could not forbear glancing round her from time to time to see where it came from . Presently she caught sight of a sort of boxlike object fastened to one of the central pillars of the room , and a thing like the weight of a steelyard hanging down from it , which swung to and fro in ceaseless motion and appeared to be the source of the noise which had distracted her . ' I wonder what that can be , ' she thought to herself , ' and what it can be used for ? '"
正 发呆 时 ， 陡 听 得 “ 当 ” 的 一声 ， 又 若 金钟 铜 磬 一般 ， 倒 吓 得 不住 的 展 眼儿 。,"As she studied the strange box , it suddenly gave forth a loud dong ! like the sound of a bronze bell or a copper chime , which so startled the old lady that her eyes nearly popped out of her head ."
接着 一连 又 是 八九 下 ， 欲 待 问 时 ， 只见 小丫头 们 一齐 乱跑 ， 说 ： “ 奶奶 下来 了 。 ” 平儿 和 周瑞家 的 忙 起身 说 ： “ 老 老 只管 坐 着 ， 等 是 时候 儿 ， 我们 来 请 你 。 ” 说 着 迎 出去 了 。,"The dong ! was followed in rapid succession by eight or nine others , and Grannie Liu was on the point of asking what it meant , when all the maids in the house began scurrying about shouting , ' The mistress ! The mistress ! She will be coming out now ! ' and Patience and Zhou Rui 's wife hurriedly rose to their feet . ' Just stay here , Grannie , ' they said . ' When it is time for you to see her , we shall come in and fetch you ' ; and they went off ' with the other servants to greet their mistress ."
刘老老 只 屏声 侧耳 默候 ， 只 听 远远 有人 笑声 ， 约 有 一二十个 妇人 ， 衣裙 窸 窣 ， 渐入 堂屋 ， 往 那边 屋内 去 了 。,"As Grannie Liu sat in silence , waiting with bated breath and head cocked to one side for her summons , she heard a far-off sound of laughter , followed presently by a sound of rustling dresses as between ten and twenty women entered the reception room and passed from it into the room beyond ."
又 见 三两个 妇人 ， 都 捧 着 大红 油漆 盒 ， 进 这边 来 等候 。,Then two or three women bearing large red lacquer boxes took up their positions on the side nearest the room in which she sat and stood there waiting to be called .
听 得 那边 说道 “ 摆饭 ” ， 渐渐 的 人才 散 出去 ， 只有 伺候 端菜 的 几个 人 。,"A voice in the far room called out , ' Serve now , please ! ' at which , to judge from the noises , most of the women scuttled off , leaving only the few who were waiting at table ."
半日 鸦雀 不 闻 。,A long silence ensued in which not so much as a cheep could be heard ;
忽 见 两个 人 抬 了 一张 炕桌 来 ， 放在 这边 炕 上 ， 桌上 碗盘 摆列 ， 仍 是 满满的 鱼肉 ， 不过 略动 了 几样 。,"then two women came in bearing a small , low table which they set down on the kang . It was covered with bowls and dishes containing all kinds of meat and fish , only one or two of which appeared to have been touched ."
板儿 一 见 就 吵 着 要 肉 吃 ， 刘老老 打 了 他 一巴掌 。,At the sight of it Ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and was silenced by Grannie Liu with a resounding slap .
忽 见 周瑞家 的 笑嘻嘻 走 过来 ， 点 手儿 叫 他 ， 刘老老 会意 ， 于是 带 着 板儿 下炕 ， 至 堂屋 中间 ， 周瑞家 的 又 和 他 咕唧 了 一会 子 ， 方 蹭 到 这边 屋内 。,"Just at that moment Zhou Rui 's wife appeared , her face all wreathed in smiles , and advanced towards Grannie Liu beckoning . Grannie Liu slipped off the kang , lifted down Ban-er , and exchanged a few hurried whispers with her in the reception room before waddling into the room beyond ."
只见 门外 铜 钩 上 悬 着 大红 洒花软帘 ， 南 窗下 是 炕 ， 炕 上 大红 条毡 ， 靠 东边 板壁 立 着 一个 锁子 锦 的 靠背 和 一个 引枕 ， 铺 着 金线 闪 的 大 坐褥 ， 傍边 有 银 唾盒 。,"A dark-red patterned curtain hung from brass hooks over the doorway . Inside , under the window in the south wall , there was a kang covered with a dark-red carpet . At the east end of the kang , up against the wooden partition wall , were a backrest and bolster , both covered in gold brocade , and a large flat cushion for sitting on , also glittering with gold thread . Beside them stood a silver spittoon ."
那凤姐 家常 带 着 紫貂 昭君 套 ， 围着 那 攒 珠勒子 ， 穿着 桃红 洒 花袄 ， 石青 刻丝 灰鼠 披风 ， 大红 洋绉 银鼠 皮裙 ；,"Wang Xi-feng had on a little cap of red sable , which she wore about the house for warmth , fastened on with a pearl-studded bandeau . She was dressed in a sprigged peachpink gown , with an ermine-lined skirt of dark-red foreign crépe underneath it , and a cloak of slate-blue silk with woven coloured insets and lining of grey squirrel around her shoulders ."
粉光脂艳 ， 端端正正 坐在 那里 ， 手内 拿 着 小 铜 火 箸 儿 拨 手炉 内 的 灰 。,"Her face was exquisitely made-up . She was sitting on the edge of the kang , her back straight as a ramrod , with a diminutive pair of tongs in her hand , removing the spent charcoal from a portable hand-warmer ."
平儿 站 在 炕沿 边 ， 捧 着 小小的 一个 填 漆 茶盘 ， 盘内 一个 小 盖钟儿 。,Patience stood beside her carrying a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray .
凤姐 也 不 接茶 ， 也 不 抬头 ， 只管 拨 那 灰 ， 慢慢 的 道 ： “ 怎么 还 不 请进来 ？ ”,"Xi-feng appeared not to have noticed her , for she neither reached out for the cup nor raised her head , but continued picking absorbedly at her handwarmer . At last she spoke : ' Why not ask them in , then ? '"
一面 说 ， 一面 抬身 要 茶 时 ， 只见 周瑞家 的 已 带 了 两个 人 立 在 面前 了 ， 这 才 忙 欲 起身 、 犹 未 起身 ， 满面春风 的 问好 ， 又 嗔着 周瑞家 的 ： “ 怎么 不早 说 ！ ”,"As she did so , she raised her head and saw Zhou Rui 's wife with her two charges already standing in front of her . She made a confused movement as if to rise to her feet , welcomed the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence , and almost in the same breath said rather crossly to Zhou Rui 's wife , ' Why did not you tell me ? '"
刘老老 已 在 地下 拜 了 几拜 ， 问 姑奶奶 安 。,By this time Grannie Liu was already down on her knees and had touched her head several times to the floor in reverence to her ' Aunt Feng ' .
凤姐 忙 说 ： “ 周姐姐 ， 搀 着 不 拜 罢 。,"' Stop her , Zhou dear ! ' said Xi-feng in alarm . ' She must not do that , I am much too young !"
我 年轻 ， 不大 认得 ， 可 也 不知 是 什么 辈数儿 ， 不敢 称呼 。 ”,"In any case , I do not know her very well . I do not know what sort of relations we are and what I should call her . '"
周瑞家 的 忙 回道 ： “ 这 就是 我 才 回 的 那个 老 老 了 。 ”,"' This is the Grannie Liu I was just telling you about , ' said Zhou Rui 's wife ."
凤姐 点头 ， 刘老老 已 在 炕沿 上 坐下 了 。,"Xi-feng nodded , and Grannie Liu sat herself down on the edge of the kang ."
板儿 便 躲 在 他 背后 ， 百般 的 哄 他 出来 作揖 ， 他 死 也 不肯 。,Ban-er at once hid himself behind her back and neither threats nor blandishments would induce him to come out and make a bow to his ' Auntie ' .
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 亲戚 们 不大 走动 ， 都 疏远 了 。,"' Relations do not come to see us much nowadays , ' said Xi-feng affably . ' We are getting to be quite strangers with everybody ."
知道 的 呢 ， 说 你们 弃 嫌 我们 ， 不肯 常 来 ；,People who know us realize that it is because you are tired of us that you do not visit us oftener ;
不 知道 的 那 起 小人 ， 还 只当 我们 眼里 没 人 似的 。 ”,"but some spiteful people who do not know us so well think its our fault , because we have grown too proud . '"
刘老老 忙 念佛 道 ： “ 我们 家 道 艰难 ， 走 不起 。,Grannie Liu invoked the Lord Buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view . It is hard times that keeps us away . We can not afford to visit .
来到 这里 ， 没 的 给 姑奶奶 打嘴 ， 就是 管家 爷们 瞧 着 也 不象 。 ”,"We are afraid that if we came to see you looking the way we are , you would disown us ; and even the people at the gate might think we were tramps ! '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 这话 没 的 叫 人 恶心 ， — — 不过 托赖 着 祖父 的 虚名 ， 作 个 穷 官儿 罢 咧 ， 谁家 有 什么 ？,' Now you are really being too hard on us ! What if Grandfather did make a little bit of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment ? What does it all amount to ?
不过 也 是 个 空架子 。,"It is all empty show , really ."
俗语 儿说 的 好 ， ‘ 朝廷 还有 三门 子 穷亲 ’ 呢 ， 何况 你 我 ？ ”,"You know what they say : "" Even the Emperor has poor relations . "" It would be strange indeed if we did not have a few !"
说 着 ， 又 问 周瑞家 的 ： “ 回 了 太太 了 没有 ？ ”,She turned to Zhou Rui 's wife . ' Have you told Her Ladyship yet ? '
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 等 奶奶 的 示下 。 ”,"' No , madam . I was waiting for your instructions . '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 你 去 瞧瞧 ， 要是 有人 就 罢 ；,"' Go and have a look , then ."
要 得闲 呢 ， 就 回 了 ， 看 怎么 说 。 ”,"If she has anyone with her , you had better leave it ; but if she is free , tell her about their visit and see what she says . '"
周瑞家 的 答应 去 了 。,Zhou Rui 's wife departed on her errand .
这里 凤姐 叫 人 抓 了 些 果子 给 板儿 吃 ， 刚 问 了 几句 闲话 时 ， 就 有 家下 许多 媳妇儿 管事 的 来回 话 。,"Xi-feng told one of the servants to give Ban-er a handful of sweets , and had just begun a desultory conversation with Grannie Liu when a number of domestics and underlings of either sex arrived to report on their duties ."
平儿 回 了 ， 凤姐 道 ： “ 我 这里 陪客 呢 ， 晚上 再 来回 。,"' I am entertaining a guest , ' said Xi-feng to Patience when she came in to announce their arrival . ' Let them leave it until this evening ."
要 有 紧 事 ， 你 就 带进来 现办 。 ”,"But if anyone has important business , bring them in and I will deal with it now . '"
平儿 出去 ， 一会 进来 说 ： “ 我 问 了 ， 没什么 要紧 的 。 我 叫 他们 散 了 。 ”,"Patience went out and returned a minute later to say that she had asked them and no one had any business of special importance , so she had sent them all away ."
凤姐 点头 。,Xi-feng nodded .
只见 周瑞家 的 回来 ， 向凤姐 道 ： “ 太太 说 ： ‘ 今日 不 得闲儿 ， 二 奶奶 陪 着 也 是 一样 ， 多谢 费心 想着 。,"At this point Zhou Rui 's wife returned with a message for Xi-feng . ' Her Ladyship says she is not free today , but that if you will entertain them for her , it will be just the same as if she were to receive them herself . She says please thank them very much for coming ."
要是 白来 逛逛 呢 便 罢 ； 有 什么 说 的 ， 只管 告诉 二 奶奶 。 ’ ”,"And she says if it is just an ordinary visit she has nothing more to add ; but if they have anything particular to say , she says tell them that they can say it to you instead . '"
刘老 老道 ： “ 也 没 甚的 说 ， 不 过来 睄 睄 姑 太太 姑奶奶 ， 也 是 亲戚 们 的 情分 。 ”,"' I had not anything particular in mind , ' said Grannie Liu . ' Only to look in on Her Ladyship and your mistress . Just a visit to relations . '"
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 没有 什么 说 的 便 罢 ； 要 有 话 ， 只管 回二 奶奶 ， 和 太太 是 一样 儿 的 。 ”,"' Well all right then , if you are sure you have nothing to say But if you haye got anything to say , you really ought to tell the mistress . It will be just the same as if you were to say it to Her Ladyship . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 递 了 个 眼色 儿 。,Zhou Rui 's wife darted a meaningful look at Grannie Liu as she said this .
刘老老 会意 ， 未语 先 红了脸 ， 待 要 不 说 ， 今日 所 为何 来 ？,"Grannie Liu perfectly well understood the significance of this look , and a blush of shame overspread her face . Yet if she did not speak up now , what would have been the purpose of her visit ?"
只得 勉强 说道 ： “ 论 今日 初次 见 ， 原 不该 说 的 ； 只是 大远 的 奔 了 你老 这里 来 ， 少不得 说 了 … … ”,"She forced herself to say something . ' By rights I ought not to mention it today , seeing that this is our first meeting : but as I have come such a long way to see you , it seems silly not to speak . . . '"
刚 说 到 这里 ， 只 听 二门 上 小厮 们 回说 ： “ 东府里 小 大爷 进来 了 。 ” 凤姐忙 和 刘老老 摆手 道 ： “ 不必 说 了 。 ”,She had got no further when the pages from the outer gate announced the arrival of ' the young master from the Ning mansion ' and Xi-feng gestured to her to stop . ' It is all right . There is no need to tell me . '
一面 便 问 ： “ 你 蓉 大爷 在 那里 呢 ？ ”,"She turned to the pages . ' Where is Master Rong , then ? '"
只 听 一路 靴子 响 ， 进来 了 一个十七八岁 的 少年 ， 面目 清秀 ， 身段 苗条 ， 美服华 冠 ， 轻裘 宝带 。,"A man 's footstep sounded outside and a fresh-faced , willowy youth of seventeen or eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress came into the room ."
刘老老 此时 坐 不是 ， 站 不是 ， 藏 没 处藏 ， 躲 没处 躲 。,"Grannie Liu , acutely embarrassed in this male presence , did not know whether to sit or stand , and looked round her in vain for somewhere to hide herself ."
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 只管 坐 着 罢 ， 这 是 我 侄儿 。 ”,Xi-feng laughed at her discomfiture . ' Do not mind him ; just stay where you are ! It is only my nephew . '
刘老老 才 扭扭捏捏 的 在 炕沿 儿 上 侧身 坐下 。,"With a good deal of girlish simpering Grannie Liu sat down again , perching herself obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang ."
那 贾蓉 请 了 安 ， 笑 回道 ： “ 我 父亲 打发 来求 婶子 ， 上 回 老舅 太太 给 婶子 的 那 架 玻璃 炕 屏 ， 明儿 请 个 要紧 的 客 ， 略 摆 一 摆 就 送来 。 ”,"Jia Rong saluted his aunt Manchu fashion . ' My father is entertaining an important visitor tomorrow and he wondered if he might borrow the little glass screen that your Uncle Wang 's wife gave you , to put on our kang while he is there . We can let you have it back again as soon as he has gone . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 你 来 迟 了 ， 昨儿 已经 给 了 人 了 。 ”,"' You are too late , ' said Xi-feng . ' I lent it yesterday to someone else . '"
贾蓉 听说 ， 便 笑嘻嘻 的 在 炕沿 上下 个 半 跪道 ： “ 婶子 要 不 借 ， 我 父亲 又 说 我 不会 说话 了 ； 又 要 挨 一顿 好 打 。,"Jia Rong flashed a winning smile at her and half-knelt on the side of the kang . ' If you will not lend it , my father will say that I did not ask properly and I shall get a beating ."
好 婶子 ， 只当 可怜 我 罢 ！ ”,"Come on , Auntie , be a sport ! Just for my sake ! '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 也 没见 我们 王家 的 东西 都 是 好 的 ？,Xi-feng smiled maliciously . ' I do not know what is so special about my family 's things .
你们 那里 放 着 那些 好 东西 ， 只别 看见 我 的 东西 才 罢 ， 一 见 了 就 想 拿 了 去 。 ”,"Heaven knows , you have enough stuff of your own over there ; yet you have only to set eyes on anything of ours , and you want it for yourselves . '"
贾蓉笑 道 ： “ 只求 婶娘 开恩 罢 ！ ”,"Jia Rong 's smile flashed again . ' Please , Auntie ! Be merciful ! '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 碰坏 一点儿 ， 你 可 仔细 你 的 皮 ！ ”,"' If it is the tiniest bit chipped , ' said Xi-feng , ' I will have the hide off you ! '"
因命 平儿拿 了 楼门 上 钥匙 ， 叫 几个 妥当 人 来 抬去 。,She ordered Patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable servants to carry it over .
贾蓉喜 的 眉开眼笑 ， 忙 说 ： “ 我 亲自 带 人 拿 去 ， 别 叫 他们 乱 碰 。 ” 说 着 便 起身 出去 了 。,"Delighted with his good luck , Jia Rong hurriedly forestalled her . ' I will get some of my own people to carry it . Do not put yours to a lot of trouble ! ' and he hurried out ."
这 凤姐 忽然 想起 一件 事来 ： 便 向 窗外 叫 ： “ 蓉 儿 回来 。 ”,"Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something , and called to him through the window , ' Rong , come back !"
外面 几个 人 接声 说 ： “ 请 蓉 大爷 回来 呢 。 ”,"Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry , ' Master Rong , you are wanted back again ! '"
贾蓉忙 回来 ， 满脸 笑容 的 瞅 着 凤姐 ， 听 何 指示 。,"Jia Rong came hurrying back , wreathed in smiles , and looked at Xi-feng with eyebrows arched inquiringly ."
那凤姐 只管 慢慢 吃 茶 ， 出 了 半日 神 ， 忽然 把 脸 一 红 ， 笑 道 ： “ 罢了 ， 你 先 去 罢 。,"Xi-feng , however , sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while , saying nothing . Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh : ' It does not matter ."
晚饭 后 你 来 再说 罢 。,Come back again after supper .
这 会子 有人 ， 我 也 没 精神 了 。 ”,"I have got company now , and besides , I do not feel in the mood to tell you . '"
贾蓉 答应 个 是 ， 抿着嘴 儿 一 笑 ， 方慢慢 退去 。,"' Yes , Aunt , ' said Jia Rong , and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he sauntered slowly out of the room ."
这 刘老 老方 安顿 了 ， 便 说道 ： “ 我 今日 带 了 你 侄儿 ， 不 为 别的 ， 因 他 爹娘 连吃 的 没有 ， 天气 又 冷 ， 只得 带 了 你 侄儿 奔 了 你老 来 。 ”,"Having all this while had time to collect herself , Grannie Liu began her speech again : ' The real reason I have brought your little nephew here today is because his Pa and Ma haven ' t anything in the house to eat , and the weather is getting colder , and - and - I thought I would bring him here to see you ... '"
说 着 ， 又 推 板儿 道 ： “ 你 爹 在 家里 怎么 教 你 的 ？,She gave Ban-er a despairing push . ' What did your Pa tell you to say when we got here ?
打发 咱们 来 作 煞 事 的 ？,What was it he sent us for ? Look at you !
只顾 吃 果子 ！ ”,All you can do is sit there eating sweets ! '
凤姐 早已 明白 了 ， 听 他 不会 说话 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 不必 说 了 ， 我 知道 了 。 ”,"It was abundantly clear to Xi-feng that the old lady was too embarrassed to go on , and she put her out of her misery with a gracious smile . ' It is quite all right . There is no need to tell me . I quite understand . '"
因 问 周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 这 老 老 不知 用 了 早饭 没有 呢 ？ ”,She turned to Zhou Rui 's wife . ' I wonder if Grannie has eaten yet today ? '
刘老老 忙 道 ： “ 一 早就 往 这里 赶 咧 ， 那里 还有 吃饭 的 工夫 咧 ？ ”,"' We were on our way first thing this morning , ' Grannie Liu chimed in . ' There was no time to think about eating . '"
凤姐 便命 ： “ 快 传饭 来 。 ” 一时 周瑞家 的 传 了 一桌 客馔 ， 摆在 东 屋里 ， 过来 带 了 刘老老 和 板儿 过去 吃饭 ， 凤姐 这里 道 ： “ 周姐姐 好生 让 着 些 儿 ， 我 不能 陪 了 。 ”,"Xi-feng gave orders for a meal to be brought in , and Zhou Rui 's wife went out and presently reappeared with a guest 's portion of various choice dishes on a little table , which she set down in the east wing , and to which she then conducted Grannie Liu and Ban-er for their meal . ' Zhou , dear , ' said Xi-feng , ' will you keep them company and see that they have enough to eat ? I shall not be able to sit with them myself . '"
一面 又 叫 过 周瑞家 的 来 问道 ： “ 方才 回 了 太太 ， 太太 怎么 说 了 ？ ”,"Then calling her aside for a moment she asked , ' What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them just now ? '"
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 太太 说 ： ‘ 他们 原 不是 一家子 ； 当年 他们 的 祖和 太老爷 在 一处 做官 ， 因 连了宗 的 。,' She said they do not really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office .
这 几年 不大 走动 。 当时 他们 来 了 ， 却 也 从 没空 过 的 ；,"She said they haven ' t been round much of late years , but in the old days when they used to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed ."
如今 来 瞧 我们 ， 也 是 他 的 好意 ， 别 简慢 了 他 。,She said it was nice of them to come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately .
要 有 什么 话 ， 叫 二 奶奶 裁夺 着 就是 了 。 ’ ”,"And she said if they appear to want anything , she would leave it to you to decide what we should do for them ."
凤姐 听 了 说道 ： “ 怪道 既是 一家子 ， 我 怎么 连影儿 也 不 知道 ！ ”,' No wonder ! ' exclaimed Xi-feng when she had heard this account . ' I could not understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them . '
说话 间 ， 刘老老 已 吃 完 了 饭 ， 拉 了 板儿 过来 ， 舚 唇 咂嘴 的 道谢 。,"While they were talking , Grannie Liu came back from the other room having already finished eating , smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively , and voicing her thanks for the repast ."
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 且 请坐下 ， 听 我 告诉 你 ：,"' Sit down , ' said Xi-feng with a smile . ' I have something to say to you ."
方才 你 的 意思 ， 我 已经 知道 了 。,I quite understand what you were trying to tell me just now .
论 起 亲戚 来 ， 原该 不等 上门 就 有 照应 才 是 ；,"As we are relations , we ought by rights not to wait for you to come to our door before helping you when you are in trouble ;"
但 只 如今 家里 事情 太 多 ， 太太 上 了 年纪 ， 一时 想不到 是 有 的 。,"but there are so many things to attend to in this family , and now that Her Ladyship is getting on a bit she does not always remember them all ."
我 如今 接着 管事 ， 这些 亲戚 们 又 都 不大 知道 ， 况且 外面 看着 ， 虽 是 烈烈轰轰 ， 不知 大 有大 的 难处 ， 说 给 人 也 未必 信 。,"And since I took over the management of the household , I find there are quite a lot of relations that I do not even know about . And then again , of course , though we may look thriving enough from the outside , people do not realize that being a big establishment like ours carries its own difficulties . They will not believe it if you tell them , but it is true ."
你 既 大远 的 来 了 ， 又 是 头 一遭 儿 和 我 张 个口 ， 怎么 叫 你 空 回去 呢 ？,"However , since you have come such a long way , and since this is the first time you have ever said a word about needing help , we obviously can not let you go back empty-handed ."
可巧 昨儿 太太 给 我 的 丫头 们 作 衣裳 的 二十两 银子 还 没动 呢 ， 你 不 嫌少 ， 先 拿 了 去 用 罢 。 ”,"Fortunately it so happens that I still haven ' t touched any of the twenty taels of silver that Her Ladyship gave me the other day to make clothes for the maids with . If you do not mind it being so little , you are very welcome to take it . '"
那 刘老老 先 听见 告 艰苦 ， 只当 是 没 想头 了 ， 又 听见 给 他 二十两 银子 ， 喜 的 眉开眼笑 道 ：,"When Grannie Liu heard Xi-feng talk about ' difficulties ' she concluded that there was no hope . Her delight and the way in which her face lit up with pleasure when she heard that she was , after all , to be given twenty taels of sliver can be imagined ."
“ 我们 也 知道 艰难 的 ， 但 只 俗语说 的 ： ‘ 瘦 死 的 骆驼比 马 还 大 ’ 呢 。,"' We knew you had your troubles , ' she said , ' but as the saying goes , "" A starved camel is bigger than a fat horse . """
凭 他 怎样 ， 你老 拔 一根 寒毛 比 我们 的 腰 还 壮 哩 ！ ”,"Say what you like , a hair plucked from your arm is thicker than a man 's waist to folks like us ! '"
周瑞家 的 在 旁 听见 他 说 的 粗鄙 ， 只管 使眼色 止 他 。,"Horrified by the crudity of these expressions , Zhou Rui 's wife , who was standing by , was meanwhile signalling frantically to the old lady to stop ."
凤姐笑 而 不睬 ， 叫 平儿 把 昨儿 那 包 银子 拿来 ， 再 拿 一串 钱 ， 都 送 至 刘老老 跟前 。,But Xi-feng laughed quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string of cash to go with it . The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu .
凤姐 道 ： “ 这 是 二十两 银子 ， 暂且 给 这 孩子 们 作件 冬衣 罢 。,"' Here is the twenty taels of silver , ' said Xi-feng . ' Take this for the time being to make some winter clothes for the children with ."
改日 没事 ， 只管 来 逛逛 ， 才 是 亲戚 们 的 意思 。,"Some time later on , when you have nothing better to do , look in on us for a day or two for kinship 's sake ."
天 也 晚 了 ， 不 虚留 你们 了 。,"It is late now , so I will not try to keep you ."
到 家 该 问好 的 都 问 个 好 儿 罢 。 ”,Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered when you get back !
一面 说 ， 一面 就 站 起来 了 。 刘老老 只是 千恩万谢 的 ， 拿 了 银钱 ， 跟着 周瑞家 的 走到 外边 。,"She rose to her feet , and Grannie Liu , with heartfelt expressions of gratitude , picked up the money and followed Zhou Rui 's wife out of the room ."
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 我 的 娘 ！ 你 怎么 见 了 他 倒 不会 说话 了 呢 ？,"' My dear good woman , ' said the latter when they were out of earshot , ' whatever came over you ? First , when you met her , you could not get a word out ;"
开口 就是 ‘ 你 侄儿 ’ ； 我 说 句 不怕 你 恼 的话 ： 就是 亲 侄儿 也 要说 的 和 软 些 儿 。,"then , when you did start talking , it was all "" your nephew "" this and "" your nephew "" that ! I hope you will not mind my saying so , but even if the child was a real nephew you would still need to go a bit easy on the familiarities ."
那蓉 大爷 才 是 他 的 侄儿 呢 ， 他 怎么 又 跑 出 这么 个 侄儿 来 了 呢 ！ ”,"Now Master Rong , he is her real nephew . That is the sort of person a lady like that calls "" nephew "" . Where she would come by a nephew like this one , I just do not know !"
刘老老 笑 道 ： “ 我 的 嫂子 ！ 我 见 了 他 ， 心眼儿 里 爱 还 爱 不 过来 ， 那里 还 说 的 上话 来 ？ ”,"' My dear , ' replied Grannie Liu with a laugh , ' when I saw the pretty little darling sitting there , I took such a liking to her that my heart was too full to speak . '"
二人 说 着 ， 又 到 周瑞家 坐 了 片刻 ， 刘老老 要 留下 一块 银子 给 周家 的 孩子 们 买 果子吃 ， 周瑞家 的 那里 放在眼里 ， 执意 不肯 ， 刘老老 感谢 不尽 ， 仍 从 后门 去 了 。,"Back in Zhou Rui 's quarters the two women sat talking for a while . Grannie Liu wanted to leave a piece of silver to buy something for the Zhou children with , but Zhou Rui 's wife said she would not hear of it and refused absolutely to accept anything . And so , with many expressions of gratitude , the old lady took her leave and set out once more through the back gate of the mansion ."
未知 去后 如何 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"And if you want to know what happened after she had left , you will have to read the next chapter ."
第七回,Chapter 7
送 宫花 贾琏 戏熙 凤,Zhou Rui 's wife delivers palace flowers and finds Jia Lian pursuing night sports by day
宴 宁府宝玉 会 秦钟,Jia Bao-yu visits the Ning-guo mansion and has an agreeable colloquy with Qin-shi 's brother
话 说 周瑞家 的 送 了 刘老老 去 后 ， 便 上 来回 王夫人 话 ， 谁知 王夫人 不在 上房 ， 问 丫鬟 们 ， 方知 往 薛姨妈 那边 说话 儿 去 了 。,"When Zhou Rui 's wife had finished seeing off Grannie Liu , she went to Lady Wang is place to report . Lady Wang , however , was not in her apartment . The maids said that she had gone off to visit Aunt Xue ."
周瑞家 的 听说 ， 便出 东 角门 ， 过 东院 ， 往 梨 香院 来 。,"Zhou Rui 's wife accordingly went out by the gate in the east corner of the compound , crossed the eastern courtyard , and made her way to Pear Tree Court ."
刚至 院门 前 ， 只见 王夫人 的 丫鬟 金钏儿 和 那 一个 才 留头 的 小 女孩儿 站 在 台阶 儿 上 玩 呢 。,"As she reached the gate of the Court , she came upon Lady Wang 's maid , Golden , playing on the front steps with a young girl ."
看见 周瑞家 的 进来 ， 便 知有 话 来回 ， 因 往里 努嘴儿 。,Golden realized that Zhou Rui 's wife must have come with a message for Lady Wang and indicated that her mistress was inside by turning her chin towards the house and shooting out her lips .
周瑞家 的 轻轻 掀 帘 进去 ， 见 王夫人 正 和 薛姨妈 长篇大套 的 说 些 家务 人 情话 ， 周瑞家 的 不敢 惊动 ， 遂 进 里间 来 。 只见 薛宝钗 家常 打扮 ， 头上 只 挽着 儿 ， 坐在 炕 里边 ， 伏在 几上 和 丫鬟 莺 儿 正在 那里 描花 样子 呢 。,"Zhou Rui 's wife gently raised a side of the portiére and entered . She found the two sisters in the midst of a seemingly interminable discussion of some domestic odyssey . Not daring to interrupt it , she passed on into the inner room , where Xue Bao-chai , dressed in workaday clothes , her hair unadorned and twisted in a knot on top of her head , sat with her maid Oriole over a little table towards the back of the kang , tracing a pattern for her embroidery ."
见 他 进来 ， 便 放下 笔 ， 转过身 ， 满面 堆笑 让 ： “ 周姐姐 坐 。 ”,"Seeing Zhou Rui 's wife enter , she laid down her tracing brush , turned towards her with a smile , and invited her to sit with them ."
周瑞家 的 也 忙 陪笑 问道 ： “ 姑娘 好 ？ ” 一面 炕沿 边 坐 了 ， 因说 ： “ 这 有 两三天 也 没见 姑娘 到 那边 逛逛 去 ， 只怕 是 你 宝兄弟 冲撞 了 你 不成 ？ ”,"' How are you , Miss ? ' asked Zhou Rui 's wife , returning her smile and sitting down on the edge of the kang . ' I haven ' t seen you over our side these last two or three days . Has Master Bao been upsetting you ? '"
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 那里 的话 ！,"' Good gracious , no ! ' said Bao-chai with a laugh ."
只 因 我 那 宗病 又 发 了 ， 所以 且 静养 两天 。 ”,I have had an attack of my old sickness again and thought I had better rest quietly at home for a day or two . That is the only reason . '
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 正是 呢 ！,' Very sensible ! ' said Zhou Rui 's wife .
姑娘 到底 有 什么 病根儿 ？,"' But what is this sickness of yours , Miss ?"
也 该 趁早 请 个 大夫 认真 医治 医治 。,Ought not you to call in a doctor and get it properly seen to ?
小小的 年纪 儿 ， 倒作 下 个 病根儿 ， 也 不是 玩 的 呢 ！ ”,Its no joke when a young person of your age let's an illness get its grip on them . '
宝钗 听说 笑 道 ： “ 再 别 提起 这个 病 ！,"' Oh , do not talk about my illness ! ' said Bao-chai ."
也 不知 请 了 多少 大夫 ， 吃 了 多少 药 ， 花 了 多少钱 ， 总 不见 一点 效验 儿 。,"' I do not know how many doctors we must have consulted about it , and how many medicines I must have swallowed , or how much money we must have spent on it - all without any benefit whatsoever ."
后来 还 亏了 一个 和尚 ， 专治 无名 的 病症 ， 因 请 他 看 了 ， 他 说 我 这 是从 胎 里 带来 的 一股 热毒 ， 幸而 我 先天 壮 ， 还 不相干 ；,"In the end we were fortunate enough to hear of a monk who specialized in treating illnesses that other people could not diagnose and asked him to have a look at me . He said that I had a congenital tendency to overheatedness , but that fortunately , as my constitution was a strong one , it was not serious ."
要是 吃 凡药 ， 是 不中用 的 。,"He said the usual medicines would not do it any good , and he gave us a prescription supposed to have been handed down from the Immortals of the Islands ."
他 就 说 了 个 海上 仙 方儿 ， 又 给 了 一包 末药 作 引子 ， 异香 异气 的 。,He also gave us a packet of powder with a very unusual fragrance which he said was to be used as the base .
他 说 犯 了 时 吃 一丸 就 好 了 。,"He said that if each time I had a turn I took just one of the pills made up from this prescription , the sickness would go away ."
— — 倒 也 奇怪 ， 这 倒 效验 些 。,And the remarkable thing is that they really have proved quite effective . '
周瑞家 的 因 问道 ： “ 不知 是 什么 方儿 ？,"' What was this prescription , Miss ?"
姑娘 说 了 ， 我们 也好 记 着 ， 说 给 人 知道 ， 要 遇见 这样 病 ， 也 是 行 好 的 事 。 ”,"If you will tell me , I shall try to remember it so that I can pass it on to others . If I ever met anyone else who had the same sort of illness , I could do them a charity , could not I ? '"
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 不问 这 方儿 还好 ， 若 问 这 方儿 ， 真 把 人 琐碎 死 了 ！,"' You do not know what you are asking , ' said Bao-chai . ' It is such a finicky prescription , it would drive anyone mad trying to make it up . It is not so much the materials ."
东西 药料 一概 却 都 有限 ， 最 难得 是 ‘ 可巧 ’ 二 字 ：,"There is , after all , a limit to the number of drugs from one part of the world or another that are available . It is the timing involved that is so difficult ."
要 春天 开 的 白牡丹 花蕊 十二两 ， 夏天 开 的 白 荷花 蕊 十二两 ， 秋天 的 白芙蓉 蕊 十二两 ， 冬天 的 白 梅花 蕊 十二两 。,"' You have to take twelve ounces of stamens of the spring-flowering white tree-peony , twelve ounces of stamens of the summer-flowering white water-lily , twelve ounces of stamens of the autumn-flowering white lotus , and twelve ounces of stamens of the winterflowering white plum and dry them all in the sun on the day of the spring equinox of the year immediately following the year you picked them in ."
将 这 四样 花蕊 于 次年 春分 这 一天 晒干 ， 和 在 末药 一处 ， 一齐 研好 ；,Then you have to mix them with the powder I told you about and pound them all up together in a mortar .
又 要 雨水 这日 的 天落水 十二 钱 ， … … ”,Then you must take twelve drams of rain water that fell on the Rain Days in the second month . . . '
周瑞家 的 笑道 ： “ 暧呀 ！ 这么 说 就 得 三年 的 工夫 呢 ！,"Zhou Rui 's wife laughed . ' Why , that is already three years it would take !"
倘或 雨水 这日 不下雨 ， 可 又 怎么着 呢 ？ ”,And suppose it did not rain that year on the Rain Days ? '
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 所以 了 ！ 那里 有 这么 可巧 的 雨 ？,"' Exactly , ' said Bao-chai . ' Rain is seldom so obliging ."
也 只好 再 等 罢了 。,You would just have to wait till the next year .
还要 白露 这日 的 露水 十二 钱 ， 霜降 这日 的 霜 十二 钱 ， 小雪 这日 的 雪 十二 钱 。 把 这 四样 水 调匀 了 ， 丸 了 龙眼 大 的 丸子 ， 盛在 旧 磁坛 里 ， 埋 在 花根 底下 ， 若 发 了 病 的 时候 儿 ， 拿 出来 吃 一丸 ， 用 一 钱 二分 黄柏 煎 汤 送下 。 ”,"Then you have to collect twelve drams of dew on the day White Dew in the ninth month , twelve drams of frost at Frost Fall in the tenth , and twelve drams of snow at Lesser Snow in the last month of the year , stir these four kinds of water into the mixture , make it up into pills about the size of a longan , and store the pills in an old porcelain jar . The jar is supposed to be buried in a flower bed and only dug up when you have an attack of the illness . Then one of the pills is taken out and swallowed in hot water into which one and a quarter drams of tincture of phellodendron has been stirred . '"
周瑞家 的 听 了 ， 笑 道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！,' God bless my soul ! ' Zhou Rui 's wife exclaimed .
真巧 死 了 人 。,' You would certainly need some patience !
等 十年 还 未必 碰 的 全 呢 ！ ”,"Why , you might wait ten years before getting all those things at the proper times ! '"
宝钗 道 ： “ 竟好 。,"' Well , ' said Bao-chai , ' we were lucky ."
自他 去后 ， 一二 年间 ， 可巧 都 得 了 ， 好容易 配成 一料 ， 如今 从 家里 带 了 来 ， 现 埋 在 梨花 树底下 。 ”,Within only a year or two of the monk 's visit we had managed to get all the ingredients together and were able to make up the pills without trouble . We brought them with us when we came to live here and have buried them under one of the pear-trees in the garden . '
周瑞家 的 又 道 ： “ 这 药 有 名字 没有 呢 ？ ”,' Has this medicine got a name ? ' Zhou Rui 's wife asked .
宝钗 道 ： “ 有 。,"' Yes , ' said Bao-chai ."
也 是 那 和尚 说 的 ， 叫作 ‘ 冷 香丸 ’ 。 ”,"The monk said the pills are called "" Cold Fragrance Pills "" . '"
周瑞家 的 听 了 点头 儿 ， 因 又 说 ： “ 这 病发 了 时 ， 到底 怎么着 ？ ”,"Zhou Rui 's wife nodded appreciatively . ' Tell me , Miss , what exactly s this illness of yours ? '"
宝钗 道 ： “ 也 不觉 什么 ， 不过 只 喘嗽 些 ， 吃 一丸 也 就 罢了 。 ”,"' It does not really bother me very much . It makes me cough and wheeze a bit . But as soon as I have taken one of the pills , it goes away . '"
周瑞家 的 还要 说话 时 ， 忽 听 王夫人 问道 ： “ 谁 在 里头 ？ ”,Zhou Rui 's wife was about to ask something else when they were interrupted by a call from Lady Wang : ' Who have you got in there ? '
周瑞家 的 忙 出来 答应 了 ， 便 回 了 刘老老 之 事 ， 略待 半刻 ， 见 王夫人 无 话 ， 方欲 退出 去 ， 薛姨妈 忽 又 笑 道 ：,"She hurried back into the outer room to make her report on Grannie Liu . Having finished it , she waited for some comment from Lady Wang , but finding that none was forthcoming , was on the point of withdrawing when Aunt Xue smilingly enjoined her to stay ."
“ 你 且 站住 。,' Just a moment !
我 有 一件 东西 ， 你 带 了 去 罢 。 ”,There is something I should like you to take for me . '
说 着 便 叫 ： “ 香菱 。 ”,She called to someone outside . ' Caltrop ! '
帘 桅 响 处 ， 才 和 金钏儿 玩 的 那个 小丫头 进来 ， 问 ： “ 太太 叫 我 做 什么 ？ ”,"The rings of the portiére rattled and the young girl whom Zhou Rui 's wife had seen a few minutes before playing on the steps with Golden came into the room . ' You called , Madam ? '"
薛姨妈 道 ： “ 把 那 匣子 里 的 花儿 拿来 。 ”,' Bring me that box with the flowers in ! '
香菱 答应 了 ， 向 那边 棒 了 个 小 锦匣 儿 来 。,Caltrop went into a side room and returned with a small embroidered box .
薛姨妈 道 ： “ 这 是 宫里 头作 的 新鲜 花样儿 堆纱 花 ， 十二枝 。,"' There are twelve artificial flowers in here , ' said Aunt Xue . ' They were made in the Imperial Palace , all in the latest fashion ."
昨儿 我 想 起来 ， 白 放 着 可惜 旧 了 ， 何不 给 他们 姐妹 们 戴 去 ！,"I suddenly thought to myself yesterday what a pity it was to leave them lying around here doing nothing , and how much nicer it would be to give them to the girls to wear ."
昨儿 要 送去 ， 偏 又 忘 了 ；,I meant to send them round yesterday but forgot .
你 今儿 来得 巧 ， 就 带 了 去 罢 。,"It is lucky that you came here today , because you will be able to take them for me ."
你家 的 三位 姑娘 ， 每位 两枝 ， 下剩 六枝 ， 送 林姑娘 两枝 ， 那 四枝 给 凤姐儿 罢 。 ”,"There are two each for each of the Jia girls . That leaves six . Then two for Miss Lin , and the remaining four for Mrs Lian . '"
王夫人 道 ： “ 留着 给 宝丫头 戴 也罢 了 ， 又 想着 他们 ！ ”,"' Keep them for Bao-chai to wear , ' said Lady Wang . ' What do you want to go bothering about our girls for ? '"
薛姨妈 道 ： “ 姨太太 不知 ， 宝丫头 怪 着 呢 ！,' You do not know our Bao-chai . She is funny about these things .
他 从来不 爱 这些 花儿 粉儿 的 。 ”,She has never liked ornaments or make-up or anything of that sort . '
说 着 ， 周瑞家 的 拿 了 匣子 ， 走出 房门 ， 见 金钏儿 仍 在 那里 晒 日阳 儿 ， 周瑞家 的 问道 ： “ 那香菱 小丫头 子可 就是 时常 说 的 ， 临 上京 时 买 的 、 为 他 打 人命官司 的 那个 小丫头 吗 ？ ”,"Zhou Rui 's wife took up the box and went out into the courtyard , where she came once more upon Golden , sunning herself on the steps . ' Tell me , she asked her , ' is that little Caltrop the one they are always talking about who was bought just before they came to the capital ? The one they had the murder trial about ? '"
金钏儿 道 ： “ 可不 就是 他 。 ”,' That is her . ' said Golden .
正说 着 ， 只见 香菱 笑嘻嘻 的 走来 ， 周瑞家 的 便 拉 了 他 的 手 细细的 看 了 一回 ， 因向 金钏儿 笑 道 ： “ 这个 模样儿 ， 竟 有些 象 咱们 东府里 的 小蓉 奶奶 的 品格 儿 。 ”,"At that moment Caltrop herself came skipping up with a sunny smile on her face , and Zhou Rui 's wife took her by the hand and studied her curiously . Then she turned to Golden again . ' You know , there is something about this child 's face that reminds me of Master Rong 's wife over at the Ning mansion . '"
金钏儿 道 ： “ 我 也 这么 说 呢 。 ”,"' That is just what I have said , ' Golden agreed ."
周瑞家 的 又 问 香菱 ： “ 你 几岁 投身 到 这里 ？ ”,Zhou Rui 's wife asked Caltrop how old she was when she became a slave .
又 问 ： “ 你 父母 在 那里 呢 ？ 今年 十几 了 ？ 本处 是 那里 的 人 ？ ”,"Then she asked her where her parents were , what her age was , and what part of the country she came from ."
香菱 听 问 ， 摇头 说 ： “ 不 记得 了 。 ”,But to all of these questions Caltrop only shook her head and said that she did not remember .
周瑞家 的 和 金钏儿 听 了 ， 倒 反为 叹息 了 一回 。,Zhou Rui 's wife and Golden exchanged glances and sighed sympathetically .
一时 周瑞家 的 携花 至 王夫人 正房 后 。,"Bearing her box of flowers , Zhou Rui 's wife presently came to the part of the house behind Lady Wang 's quarters ."
原来 近日 贾母 说 孙女 们 太 多 ， 一处 挤 着 倒 不便 ， 只 留 宝玉 黛玉 二人 在 这边 解闷 ， 却 将 迎春 、 探春 、 惜春 三 人 移到 王夫人 这边 房 后 三间 抱厦 内 居住 ， 令 李 纨 陪伴 照管 。,"Grandmother Jia had recently decided that her granddaughters were becoming too numerous and declared that she would retain only Bao-yu and Dai-yu in her own apartments to keep her amused . Ying-chun , Tan-chun and Xi-chun were to move out into the penthouse behind Lady Wang 's , with Li Wan to supervise them and keep them company ."
如今 周瑞家 的 故 顺路 先 往 这里 来 ， 只见 几个 小丫头 都 在 抱厦 内 默坐 ， 听 着 呼唤 。 迎春 的 丫鬟 司棋 和 探春 的 丫鬟 侍书 二人 ， 正 掀帘子 出来 ， 手里 都 捧 着 茶盘 茶钟 ， 周瑞家 的 便知 他 姐妹 在 一处 坐 着 ， 也 进入 房内 。,"Thither , accordingly , Zhou Rui 's wife now directed her steps . A number of little maids were sitting under the eaves there waiting to be called , and just as she arrived , Ying-chun 's maid Chess and Tan-chun 's maid Scribe came through the portiére , each carrying a teacup on a tray , from which she deduced that the two cousins must be inside together ."
只见 迎春 、 探春 二人 正在 窗 下围棋 。,"On entering the room , Zhou 's wife found Ying-chun and Tan-chun sitting by the window playing Go."
周瑞家 的 将 花 送 上 ， 说明 原故 ， 二人 忙 住 了 棋 ， 都 欠身 道谢 ， 命 丫鬟 们 收 了 。,"She presented the flowers and explained who they were from , and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks , and gave orders to the maids to take charge of them ."
周瑞家 的 答应 了 ， 因说 ： “ 四 姑娘 不在 房里 ， 只怕 在 老太太 那边 呢 ？ ”,' Where is Miss Xi-chun ? ' Zhou Rui 's wife inquired .
丫鬟 们 道 ： “ 在 那 屋里 不是 ？ ”,' Is not she in the next room ? ' said the maids ;
周瑞家 的 听 了 ， 便 往 这边 屋里 来 。,
只见 惜春正 同 水月庵 的 小姑子 智能 儿 两个 一处 玩耍 呢 ；,"and there in fact she proved to be , playing with the little nun Sapientia from Water-moon Priory ."
见 周瑞家 的 进来 ， 便 问 他 何事 。 周瑞家 的 将花 匣 打开 ， 说明 原故 ， 惜春笑 道 ：,"She asked Zhou Rui 's wife what she had come for , and when Zhou Rui 's wife took the flowers from the box and explained , she laughed :"
“ 我 这里 正 和 智能 儿 说 ， 我 明儿 也 要 剃 了 头 跟 他 作 姑子 去 呢 ； 可巧 又 送 了 花 来 ， 要 剃 了 头 ， 可 把 花儿 戴 在 那里 呢 ？ ”,"' I was telling Sapientia that one of these days I am going to have my hair shaved and go off with her to be a nun , when just at that very moment you came in with these flowers . What shall I do with flowers when I have no hair to stick them in ? '"
说 着 ， 大家 取笑 一回 ， 惜春命 丫鬟 收 了 。,Further pleasantries followed from the others present . Xi-chun told one of the maids to take the flowers and look after them .
周瑞家 的 因问 智能 儿 ： “ 你 是 什么 时候 来 的 ？,' When did you arrive ? ' Zhou Rui 's wife asked Sapientia .
你 师父 那 秃 歪 剌 那里 去 了 ？ ”,"And where is that precious Mother Superior of yours gone off to , bald-headed old mischief ? '"
智能 儿道 ： “ 我们 一 早就 来 了 。,"' We arrived first thing this morning , ' said Sapientia ."
我 师父 见 过 太太 ， 就 往于 老爷 府 里 去 了 ， 叫 我 在 这里 等 他 呢 。 ”,' Mother Euergesia went off to visit the Yu mansion after she had seen Her Ladyship . She told me to wait for her here . '
周瑞家 的 又 道 ： “ 十五 的 月例 香 供 银子 可得 了 没有 ？ ”,' Have you had this month 's donation yet ? ' said Zhou Rui 's wife . ' It was due on the fifteenth . '
智能 儿道 ： “ 不 知道 。 ”,Sapientia said that she did not know .
惜春 便 问 周瑞家 的 ： “ 如今 各 庙 月例 银子 是 谁 管 着 ？ ”,' Who looks after the monthly donations nowadays ? ' asked Xi-chun .
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 余 信管 着 。 ”,"' Yu Xin , ' said Zhou Rui 's wife ."
惜春 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 这 就是 了 。,' That explains it .
他 师父 一来 了 ， 余 信家 的 就 赶上来 ， 和 他 师父 咕唧 了 半日 ， 想必 就是 为 这个 事 了 。 ”,"As soon as Mother Euergesia arrived , Yu Xin is wife was in here like a shot and they were chattering together for ages . I expect that is what it was about . '"
那 周瑞家 的 又 和 智能 儿 唠叨 了 一回 ， 便 往 凤姐 处来 ， 穿过 了 夹道 子 ， 从 李 纨 后窗 下 越过 西 花墙 ， 出 西 角门 ， 进 凤姐 院中 。,"After gossiping a bit longer with Sapientia , Zhou Rui 's wife made her way to Xifeng 's quarters . To get there she had to go down a passage-way between two walls , under the windows at the back of Li Wan 's apartments , along the foot of an ornamental wall , and through a gateway in the western corner of the compound ."
走 至 堂屋 ， 只见 小丫头 丰儿 坐在 房 门槛儿 上 ， 见 周瑞家 的 来 了 ， 连忙 的 摆手 儿 ， 叫 他 往 东 屋里 去 ， 周瑞家 的 会意 ， 忙 着 蹑手蹑脚 儿 的 往 东边 屋里 来 ， 只见 奶子 拍 着 大 姐儿 睡觉 呢 。,"When she entered Xifeng 's reception room , a maid sitting on the threshold of the inner room hurriedly waved her away and told her to go across to the other side of the house . Taking the hint , Zhou Rui 's wife tiptoed quietly into the room opposite , where she found the baby 's nurse patting her rhythmically to make her sleep ."
周瑞家 的 悄悄儿 问道 ： “ 二 奶奶 睡 中觉 呢 吗 ？,' Is the mistress taking her afternoon nap ? ' she asked the nurse in a low whisper . ' I
也 该 请醒 了 。 ”,"think you will have to wake her , even if she is ."
奶子 笑 着 ， 撇 着 嘴 摇头 儿 。,"The nurse smiled , grimaced , and shook her head ."
正 问 着 ， 只 听 那边 微有 笑声 儿 ， 却是 贾琏 的 声音 。,Zhou Rui 's wife was about to ask her what she meant when she heard a low laugh in what was unmistakably Jia Lian is voice from the room opposite .
接着 房门 响 ， 平儿拿 着大 铜盆 出来 ， 叫 人 舀水 。,"It was followed almost immediately by the sound of the door opening , and Patience came out carrying a large copper basin which she asked one of the maids to fetch water in ."
平儿 便 进 这边 来 ， 见 了 周瑞家 的 ， 便 问 ： “ 你 老人家 又 来 作 什么 ？ ”,"' Ah , Mrs Zhou ! she said , catching sight of Zhou Rui 's wife and crossing into the room opposite ' What brings you back again ? '"
周瑞家 的 忙 起身 拿 匣子 给 他 看道 ： “ 送 花儿 来 了 。 ”,"Zhou Rui 's wife hastily rose to her feet and picking up the box , proffered it to Patience and explained her mission ."
平儿 听 了 ， 便 打开 匣子 ， 拿 了 四枝 ， 抽身 去 了 ；,"Patience opened the lid , selected four of the flowers , and slipped away again for several minutes ."
半刻 工夫 ， 手里 拿出 两枝 来 ， 先 叫 彩 明来 ， 吩咐 ： “ 送到 那边 府 里 ， 给 小蓉 大 奶奶 戴 的 。 ”,"She came back with two still in her hand , which she gave to a little page called Sunshine . ' Take these to Master Rong 's wife over in the Ning mansion and tell her they are for her to wear , ' she said ."
次 后方 命 周瑞家 的 回去 道谢 。,Then turning to Zhou Rui 's wife she asked her to convey Xi-feng 's thanks to the donor .
周瑞家 的 这 才 往 贾母 这边 来 ， 过 了 穿堂 ， 顶头 忽 见 他 的 女孩儿 ， 打扮 着 才 从 他 婆家 来 。,"Zhou Rui 's wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia is apartments . Just as she was coming out of the covered passageway , she ran head-on into her daughter , all dressed up in her best clothes having just arrived on a visit from her mother-in-law 's ."
周瑞家 的 忙 问 ： “ 你 这 会子 跑 来 作 什么 ？ ”,' What is suddenly brought you here at a time like this ? ' she asked her daughter .
他 女孩儿 说 ： “ 妈 ， 一向 身上 好 ？,"' How have you been keeping , Mother ?"
我 在 家里 等 了 这 半日 ， 妈 竟 不 去 ， 什么 事情 这么 忙 的 不 回家 ？,I have been waiting at your place for hours for you to come back . What is been keeping you all this time ?
我 等 烦 了 ， 自己 先 到 了 老太太 跟前 请 了 安 了 ， 这 会子 请 太太 的 安去 。,"I got tired of waiting . I thought I would go and say ' hullo ' to Her Old Ladyship , and now I was just on my way to see Her Ladyship ."
妈 还有 什么 不了 的 差事 ？,Have you still not finished then ?
手里 是 什么 东西 ？ ”,What is that you have got in your hand ? '
周瑞家 的 笑道 ： “ 暧 ！,Zhou Rui 's wife laughed . ' Today is not my lucky day !
今儿 偏偏 来 了 个 刘老老 ， 我 自己 多 事 ， 为 他 跑 了 半日 ；,"First of all someone called Grannie Liu turned up , so like a fool I spend half the day rushing around with her ."
这 会子 叫 姨太太 看见 了 ， 叫 送 这 几枝 花儿 给 姑娘 奶奶 们 去 。,"Then , as if that was not enough , Her Ladyship 's sister sees me and gets me delivering flowers to the young ladies ."
这 还 没有 送完 呢 ！,I haven ' t finished yet .
你 今儿 来 ， 一定 有 什么 事情 。 ”,"Now what have you come here today for ? Something 's gone wrong , I will be bound !"
他 女孩儿 笑 道 ： “ 你 老人家 倒 会 猜 ， 一 猜 就 猜 着 了 ！,"' I do not know how you always manage to guess , Mother , but you are right : it has ."
实对 你 老人家 说 ：,I will be honest with you .
你 女婿 因 前儿 多 喝 了 点子 酒 ， 和 人 分争 起来 ， 不知 怎么 叫 人 放 了 把 邪 火 ， 说 他 来历不明 ， 告到 衙门 里 ， 要 递解 还乡 。,"My man had a cup too much to drink the other day and got into a fight with someone , and now , out of spite , they are trying to stir up trouble for him . They say his papers are not in order , and they have reported him to the yamen and want to get him deported back South to his old village ."
所以 我 来 和 你 老人家 商量 商量 ， 讨 个 情分 。,"So I thought I would come and ask your advice , Mother , and see if you could not get someone here to put in a word for him ."
不知 求 那个 可以 了 事 ？ ”,Do you think there is anyone who would be able to help ? '
周瑞家 的 听 了 道 ： “ 我 就 知道 。,"' I knew it would be something like this , ' said Zhou Rui 's wife ."
这 算 什么 大事 ， 忙 的 这么着 ！,"' Well , cheer up , it is not so serious as all that !"
你 先家 去 ， 等 我 送 下 林姑娘 的 花儿 就 回去 。,You just go back and wait while I take these flowers to Miss Lin .
这会儿 太太 二 奶奶 都 不 得闲儿 呢 ！ ”,You can not see Her Ladyship now . She and the young mistress are both busy . '
他 女孩儿 听说 ， 便 回去 了 ， 还 说 ： “ 妈 ， 好歹 快 来 。 ”,"The daughter obediently turned back to her mother 's quarters . As she went , she said pleadingly , ' Be as quick as you can , Mother , will not you ? '"
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 是 了 罢 ！ 小人儿 家 没 经过 什么 事 ， 就 急 的 这么 个 样儿 。 ” 说 着 ， 便 到 黛玉 房中 去 了 。,"' Yes , yes , yes . I will be as quick as I can ! You young people take everything so tragically ! Lack of experience , that is what it is ! ' said Zhou Rui 's wife , and moved on to Dai-yu is room ."
谁知 此时 黛玉 不在 自己 房里 ， 却 在 宝玉 房中 ， 大家 解 九连环 作戏 。,"Dai-yu was not in her own room , but with Bao-yu , trying to undo metal puzzles ."
周瑞家 的 进来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 林姑娘 ， 姨太太 叫 我 送 花儿 来 了 。 ”,"' Miss Lin , said Zhou Rui 's wife with a smile , Mrs Xue asked me to give you these flowers . '"
宝玉 听说 ， 便 说 ： “ 什么 花儿 ？ 拿来 我 瞧瞧 。 ”,' What flowers ? ' said Bao-yu . ' Let me see ! '
一面 便 伸手 接过 匣子 来看 时 ， 原来 是 两枝 宫制 堆纱 新巧 的 假花 ， 黛玉 只 就 宝玉 手中 看 了 一看 ， 便 问道 ：,"He stretched out his arm , took the box from Zhou Rui 's wife , and looked . Two artificial flowers , exquisitely fashioned by Palace craftsmen out of silk gauze , lay inside it . Daiyu glanced over his arm into the box ."
“ 还是 单 送 我 一个 人 的 ， 还是 别的 姑娘 们 都 有 呢 ？ ”,"' Am I the only one getting these , or have the others had some too ? '"
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 各位 都 有 了 ， 这 两枝 是 姑娘 的 。 ”,"' All the young ladies are getting them , ' said Zhou Rui 's wife . ' These two are for you , Miss . '"
黛玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 就 知道 么 ！,"' I thought as much , ' said Dai-yu sneeringly ."
别人 不 挑 剩下 的 也 不 给 我 呀 。 ”,' I get the leavings when everyone else has had their pick . '
周瑞家 的 听 了 ， 一声 儿 也 不敢 言语 。,"Zhou Rui 's wife received this sally in silence , not daring to retort ."
宝玉 问道 ： “ 周姐姐 ， 你 作 什么 到 那边 去 了 ？ ”,"' What were you doing at my aunt 's place , Zhou ? ' Bao-yu asked ."
周瑞家 的 因说 ： “ 太太 在 那里 ， 我 回话 去 了 ， 姨太太 就 顺便 叫 我 带来 的 。 ”,"' Her Ladyship was there , and I had something to tell her . Then while I was over there , Mrs Xue took the opportunity of giving me these flowers to deliver for her . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 宝姐姐 在 家里 作 什么 呢 ？,' Was Miss Bao-chai there ? ' Bao-yu asked .
怎么 这 几日 也 不 过来 ？ ”,' Why hasn ' t she been round these last few days ? '
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 身上 不大好 呢 ！ ”,' She is not very well . '
宝玉 听 了 ， 便 和 丫头 们 说 ： “ 谁 去 瞧瞧 ， 就 说 我 和 林姑娘 打发 来 问 姨娘 姐姐 安 ， 问 姐姐 是 什么 病 ， 吃 什么 药 。,"Bao-yu turned to his maids . ' Which of you will go and see Miss Bao-chai for me ? Say that Miss Lin and I send our regards to her and her mother , and ask her if her illness is any better and what she is taking for it ."
论理 ， 我 该 亲自 来 的 ， 就 说 才 从 学里 回来 ， 也 着 了 些 凉 ， 改日 再 亲自 来看 。 ”,"Say that I really ought to go myself , but that as I have just got back from my lessons and have caught a bit of a cold I shall be coming round another day . '"
说 着 ， 茜 雪 便 答应 去 了 。 周瑞家 的 自去 ， 无 话 。,"Snowpink said that she would go , and she and Zhou Rui 's wife left the room together and went their separate ways ."
原来 周瑞家 的 女婿 便是 雨村 的 好友 冷子兴 ， 近日 因 卖 古董 ， 和 人 打官司 ， 故 叫 女人 来 讨情 。,"This son-in-law of Zhou Rui 's who had got himself into trouble was none other than Jia Yu-cun 's old friend , Leng Zi-xing . He had recently become involved in a lawsuit arising out of the sale of some antiques , and had asked his wife to get strings pulled for him at the mansion ."
周瑞家 的 仗 着 主子 的 势 ， 把 这些 事 也 不 放在心上 ， 晚上 只求 求 凤姐 便 完 了 。,"Zhou Rui 's wife made light of the affair , confident of her employers ' power to influence . A word to Xi-feng in the evening , and it would be as good as settled ."
至 掌灯 时 ， 凤姐 卸 了 妆 ， 来 见 王夫人 ， 回说 ： “ 今儿 甄家 送 了 来 的 东西 ， 我 已 收 了 ；,At lighting-up time that evening Xi-feng came in partial négligé ( having removed her ornaments for the night ) to report on the day 's affairs to Lady Wang . ' Today I received the things sent us by the Zhen family .
咱们 送 他 的 ， 趁着 他家 有 年 下送 鲜 的 船 ， 交给 他 带 了 去 了 。 ”,"The Zhens have their own boat delivering seasonal produce for the New Year , so I have given their people our presents to the Zhens to take back on their return journey . '"
王夫人 点点头 儿 。,Lady Wang nodded .
凤姐 又 道 ： “ 临安 伯 老太太 生日 的 礼 已经 打点 了 ， 太太 派 谁 送 去 ？ ”,"' I have got our birthday presents ready for the Earl of Lin ' an ' s mother , ' continued Xifeng . ' Who would you like us to send with them ? '"
王夫人 道 ： “ 你 瞧 谁 闲着 ， 叫 四个 女人 去 就 完 了 ；,"' Just see which women are free and send four of them , replied Lady Wang ."
又 来 问 我 ！ ”,' You do not have to ask me about things like that !
凤姐 道 ： “ 今日 珍 大嫂子 来 请 我 明日 去 逛逛 ， 明日 有 什么 事 没有 ？ ”,"' Today Cousin Zhen is wife invited me to spend tomorrow with them at the other house , ' Xi-feng continued . ' Is there anything tomorrow that needs doing here ? '"
王夫人 道 ： “ 有事没事 ， 都 碍 不着 什么 。,"' Whether there is or not , ' said Lady Wang , ' I do not see that it matters ."
每 常 他 来 请 ， 有 我们 ， 你 自然 不便 ， 他 不 请 我们 单 请 你 ， 可知 是 他 的 诚心 叫 你 散荡 散荡 ；,"Generally when she brings an invitation it is for all of us , and you are naturally too busy to go . This time the invitation is to you personally , which shows that she had deliberately arranged this in order to give you a rest ."
别 辜负 了 他 的 心 ， 倒 该 过去 走走 才 是 。 ”,"The thought is a kind one , and it would be ungrateful to refuse . I think you ought to go . '"
凤姐 答应 了 。,
当下 李 纨 探春 等 妹妹 们 也 都 定 省 毕 ， 各 归 房 ， 无 话 。,"By now Li Wan and the three girls had also arrived for their evening duty , and when all had wished Lady Wang good night they departed to their different rooms ."
次日 凤姐 梳洗 了 ， 先 回 王夫人 毕 ， 方来 辞 贾母 。,"Next day , as soon as Xi-feng had completed her toilet , she first reported to Lady Wang and then went to take her leave of Grandmother Jia ."
宝玉 听 了 ， 也 要 逛去 ， 凤姐 只得 答应 着 ， 立等 换 了 衣裳 ， 姐儿 两个 坐 了 车 ， 一时 进入 宁府 ； 早 有 贾珍之 妻 尤氏 与 贾蓉 媳妇 秦氏 ， 婆媳 两个 带 着 多少 侍妾 丫鬟 等 接出 仪门 。,"Hearing that she was going to the other house , Bao-yu said he wanted to go too , and Xi-feng was obliged to say that she would take him and to stand waiting for him while he changed his clothes . The two then got into a mule-cart and were soon inside the Ning-guo mansion , where Cousin Zhen 's wife You-shi , her son Jia Rong , her little daughter-in-law Qin-shi , and a large number of women attendants and maids were standing outside the inner gate ready to welcome them ."
那尤氏 一 见 凤姐 ， 必先 嘲笑 一阵 ， 一手 拉 了 宝玉 ， 同入 上 房里 坐下 ， 秦氏 献 了 茶 ， 凤姐 便 说 ： “ 你们 请 我 来 作 什么 ？,"You-shi 's encounters with Xi-feng were always the occasion of good-humoured banter . Taking Bao-yu by the hand and chatting to Xi-feng , she conducted them both into tbe main reception room , where they all sat down and were served tea by Qin-shi . ' Well , said Xi-feng , ' what have you asked me here for ?"
拿 什么 孝敬 我 ？,"Something nice , I hope !"
有 东西 就 献上 来 罢 ；,"If it is a present , you would better bring it now ;"
我 还有 事 呢 ！ ”,I am a busy woman ! '
尤氏 未及 答应 ， 几个 媳妇 们 先 笑 道 ： “ 二 奶奶 ， 今日 不来 就 罢 ；,"Before You-shi could think of a suitable retort , one of the women attendants replied for her : ' You ought not to have come , Mrs Lian !"
既 来 了 ， 就 依 不得 你 老人家 了 。 ”,"Now that you are here , we have got you in our power and you will have to do what we say for a change ! '"
正说 着 ， 只见 贾蓉 进来 请安 ， 宝玉 因道 ： “ 大 哥哥 今儿 不 在家 么 ？ ”,At that moment Jia Rong came in and paid his respects to the visitors . Bao-yu asked what had happened to Cousin Zhen .
尤氏 道 ： “ 今儿 出 城 请 老爷 的 安去 了 。 ”,"' He is gone into the country to see Father , ' said You-shi ."
又 道 ： “ 可是 你 怪闷 的 ， 坐在 这里 作 什么 ？,"Then she added , ' It is not much fun for you sitting here ."
何不 出去 逛逛 呢 ？ ”,Why do not you go off and amuse yourself inside ? '
秦氏笑 道 ： “ 今日 可巧 ：,"' You have chosen a good day to come , Uncle Bao , ' said little Qin-shi ."
上 回 宝二叔 要 见 我 兄弟 ， 今儿 他 在 这里 书房 里 坐 着 呢 ， 为什么 不 瞧瞧 去 ？ ”,"Last time you were here you wanted to see my brother . Well , today he is here . He is sitting in the study at this very moment . Why do not you go in and see him ? '"
宝玉 便 去 要 见 ， 尤氏 忙 吩咐 人 小心 伺候 着 跟 了 去 。,Bao-yu was for rushing off straight away . You-shi hurriedly ordered some servants to go after him in discreet attendance .
凤姐 道 ： “ 既 这么着 ， 为什么 不 请进来 我 也 见见 呢 ？ ”,"' Well now , just a minute ! ' said Xi-feng . ' Why not ask him in here so that I can see him too ? '"
尤氏笑 道 ： “ 罢 ， 罢 ！ 可以 不必 见 。,"' Oh dear , I do not think that would do at all ! ' said You-shi ."
比 不得 咱们 家 的 孩子 ， 胡打海摔 的 惯 了 的 。,' Some people 's children are not used to rackety ways like ours .
人家 的 孩子 ， 都 是 斯斯文文 的 ， 没见 过 你 这样 泼辣 货 ， 还 叫 人家 笑话 死 呢 ！ ”,"Some people 's children are quiet and refined . If they were to meet a termagant like you , they might die of laughing . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 我 不 笑话 他 就 罢了 ， 他 敢 笑话 我 ！ ”,"' He will be lucky if Idon ' t laugh at him , ' said Xi-feng cheerfully . ' He would better not try laughing at me ! '"
贾蓉 道 ： “ 他 生 的 腼腆 ， 没见 过 大阵 仗 儿 ， 婶子 见 了 ， 没 的 生气 。 ”,"' He is very , very shy , Auntie , ' said Jia Rong . We are afraid that if you saw him it might only irritate you . '"
凤姐 啐 道 ： “ 呸 ！ 扯 臊 ！,' Fiddlestick ! ' said Xi-feng .
他 是 ‘ 哪吒 ’ 我 也 要 见见 。,"' I do not care if he is a three-faced wonder with eight arms , I still want to see him ."
别 放 你 娘 的 屁 了 ！ 再 不 带来 打 你 顿好 嘴巴 子 ！ ”,"Stop farting about and bring him in , or I will box your ears ! '"
贾蓉 溜 湫 着 眼儿 笑 道 ： “ 何苦 婶子 又 使 利害 ！,"Jia Rong cringed in mock alarm . ' Yes , Auntie ! No need to get so fierce !"
我们 带 了 来 就是 了 。 ”,We will bring him in straight away . '
— — 凤姐 也 笑 了 — — 说 着 出去 ， 一会儿 ， 果然 带 了 个 后生 来 ， 比 宝玉 略 瘦 些 ， 眉清目秀 ， 粉面朱唇 ， 身材 俊俏 ， 举止 风流 ， 似 更 在 宝玉 之上 ；,"They both laughed , and Jia Rong disappeared for a while and presently came back leading a youth who , though somewhat thinner than Bao-yu , was more than his equal in freshness and liveliness of feature , in delicacy of complexion , handsomeness of figure , and grace of deportment , but whose painful bashfulness created a somewhat girlish impression ."
只是 怯怯 羞羞 有些 女儿 之 态 ， 腼腆 含糊 的 向凤姐 请安 问好 ， 凤姐喜 的 先 推 宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 比 下去 了 ！ ”,"He approached Xi-feng and made his bow with a shy confusion which delighted her . ' You have met your match ! ' she said to Bao-yu with a laugh , nudging him playfully ."
便 探身 一把 攥 了 这 孩子 的 手 ， 叫 他 身旁 坐下 ， 慢慢 问 他 年纪 读书 等 事 ， 方知 他 学 名叫 秦钟 。,"Then , leaning forward and gripping the boy 's hand in her own , she drew him down beside her and proceeded in a very deliberate manner to ask him how old he was , what books he was reading , and various other matters - among them his name , which was Qin Zhong ."
早 有 凤姐 跟 的 丫鬟 媳妇 们 ， 看见 凤姐 初见 秦钟 ， 并未 备得 表礼 来 ， 遂 忙 过 那边 去 告诉 平儿 ， 平儿 素知 凤姐 和 秦氏 厚密 ， 遂 自作 主意 ， 拿 了 一匹 尺头 ， 两个 “ 状元 及第 ” 的 小金 裸 子 ， 交付 来 人 送 过去 ；,"When the maids and womenfolk in attendance on Xi-feng realized that she was about to meet Qin Zhong and that they had come without the requisite material for a First Meeting present , they had sent some of their number back to consult Patience in the other house . Patience had , at her own discretion , selected a suitable length of material and two little ' Top of the List ' solid gold medallions to give the messengers ."
凤姐 还 说 太 简薄 些 。,These gifts now arrived for Xi-feng ( who thought them somewhat on the meagre side ) to give to Qin Zhong .
秦氏 等 谢毕 ， 一时 吃 过 了 饭 ， 尤氏 、 凤姐 、 秦氏 等 抹 骨牌 ， 不在话下 。,"When he and his sister had formally thanked her , the company sat down to lunch , after which You-shi , Xi-feng and Qin-shi settled down to a game of cards , while Bao-yu and Qin Zhong left the table to converse elsewhere ."
宝玉 秦钟 二人 随便 起 坐 说话 儿 ， 那宝玉 自一 见 秦钟 ， 心中 便 如有所失 ， 痴 了 半日 ， 自己 心中 又 起 了 个 呆 想 ， 乃 自 思道 ：,"When Bao-yu first set eyes on Qin Zhong it had been as though part of his soul had left him . For a while he stared blankly , oblivious to all around him , while a stream of idle fancies passed through his mind ."
“ 天下 竟 有 这等 的 人物 ！,' How perfect he is ! Who would have believed there could be such perfection ?
如今 看 了 ， 我 竟 成 了 泥猪癞狗 了 ！,"Now that I have seen him I know that I am just a pig wallowing in the mud , a mangy dog !"
可恨 我 为什么 生 在 这 侯门公 府 之 家 ？,"Why , why did I have to be born in this pretentious aristocratic household ?"
要 也 生 在 寒儒薄 宦 的 家里 ， 早 得 和 他 交接 ， 也 不枉 生 了 一世 。,"Why could not I have been born in the family of some poor scholar or low-grade clerk ? Then I could have been near him and got to know him , and my life would have been worth living ."
我 虽 比 他 尊贵 ， 但 绫锦 纱罗 ， 也 不过 裹 了 我 这 枯株朽木 ；,"Though I am so much richer and more nobly born than he , what use are my fine clothes but to cover up the dead and rotten wood beneath ?"
羊羔美酒 ， 也 不过 填 了 我 这 粪 窟 泥 沟 ：,What use the luxuries I eat and drink but to fill the cesspit and swell the stinking sewer of my inside ?
‘ 富贵 ’ 二 字 ， 真真 把 人 荼毒 了 ！ ”,O rank and riches ! How you poison everything ! '
那秦钟 见 了 宝玉 形容 出众 ， 举止不凡 ， 更 兼 金冠 绣服 ， 艳婢 娇童 — —,"At the same time , Qin Zhong , struck by Bao-yu 's rare good looks and princely bearing and - even more perhaps - by the golden coronet and embroidered clothing and the train of pretty maids and handsome pages who attended him , was thinking :"
“ 果然 怨不得 姐姐 素日 提 起来 就 夸 不 绝口 ， 我 偏偏 生于 清寒 之 家 ， 怎 能 和 他 交接 亲厚 一番 ， 也 是 缘法 。 ”,' No wonder my sister raves about him whenever his name is mentioned ! Why did I have to be born in a poor respectable family ? How I should have liked to get to know him : to have shared moments of warmth and affection with him ! But it was not to be ! '
二人 一样 胡思乱想 。,"Each , plunged in reverie , for a while said nothing ."
宝玉 又 问 他 读 什么 书 ， 秦钟见 问 ， 便 依实 而 答 。 二人 你 言 我 语 ， 十来 句 话 ， 越觉 亲密 起来 了 。,"Then Bao-yu asked Qin Zhong about his reading , and Qin Zhong replied - a full , frank reply , without the trappings of politeness : and presently they were in the midst of a delightful conversation and were already like old friends ."
一时 捧 上 茶果 吃 茶 ， 宝玉 便 说 ： “ 我们 两个 又 不 吃酒 ， 把 果子 摆在 里间 小 炕 上 ， 我们 那里 去 ， 省 了 闹 的 你们 不安 。 ”,After a while tea and various confections were brought in . ' We two shall not be drinking any wine ' Bao-yu said to the ladies . May we have a plate or two of these things set out on the little kang in the other room ? We can talk in there without disturbing you . '
于是 二人 进 里间 来 吃 茶 。,The two boys moved into the inner room for their tea .
秦氏 一面 张罗 凤姐 吃 果酒 ， 一面 忙 进来 嘱咐 宝玉 道 ： “ 宝二叔 ： 你 侄儿 年轻 ， 倘或 说话 不 防头 ， 你 千万 看着 我 ， 别理 他 。,"In between plying Xi-feng with wine and delicacies , Qin-shi slipped in for a word with Bao-yu . ' My brother 's quite young , Uncle Bao . Please , for my sake , do not mind him if he does anything to offend you !"
他 虽 腼腆 ， 却 脾气 拐 孤 ， 不大 随和 儿 。 ”,"He may be shy , but he is got quite a nasty temper . He is not really easy to get on with at all . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 去 罢 ， 我 知道 了 。 ”,' You go along ! ' said Bao-yu with a smile . ' We shall be all right ! '
秦氏 又 嘱咐 了 他 兄弟 一回 ， 方去 陪 凤姐儿 去 了 。,"After a few admonitory words to her brother , Qin-shi went back to look after Xi-feng ."
一时 凤姐 尤氏 又 打发 人 来 问宝玉 ： “ 要 吃 什么 ， 只管 要 去 。 ”,"Some minutes later Xi-feng and You-shi sent a servant in to inquire whether the boys would like anything else to eat , adding that they had only to ask if they wanted anything ."
宝玉 只 答应 着 ， 也 无心 在 饮食 上 ， 只 问 秦钟 近日 家务 等 事 。,"Bao-yu promised that they would ; but his mind was not on eating and drinking , and he continued to question Qin Zhong about his life at home ."
秦钟 因言 ： “ 业师 于 去岁 辞馆 ， 家父 年纪 老 了 ， 残疾 在 身 ， 公务 繁冗 ， 因此 尚未 议及 延师 ， 目下 不过 在家 温习 旧 课 而已 。,"' My private tutor resigned last year , ' Qin Zhong told him . ' Father is quite old , and as his health is not very good and his job keeps him terribly busy , he hasn ' t been able to do anything yet about getting me another one . At the moment I am just going over old lessons on my own at home ."
再 读书 一事 ， 也 必须 有 一二 知己 为伴 ， 时常 大家 讨论 ， 才能 有些 进益 — — ”,"The trouble is , though , that if you want to get on in a subject , you really need one or two like-minded people to study with you , so that every so often you can all discuss what you have been reading . . . '"
宝玉 不 待 说完 ， 便 道 ： “ 正是 呢 ！,"' Exactly ! ' Bao-yu put in eagerly , not waiting for him to finish ."
我们 家 却 有 个 家塾 ， 合族 中 有 不能 延师 的 便 可入 塾 读书 ， 亲戚 子弟 可以 附读 。,"' We have a private school in our family to which any members of the clan who can not manage private tuition may send their children , and boys from related families who are not in the clan can also be admitted ."
我 因 上年 业师 回家 去 了 ， 也 现 荒废 着 。 家父 之 意 ， 亦 欲 暂 送 我 去 ， 且 温习 着 旧书 ， 待 明年 业师 上来 ， 再 各自 在家 读书 。,"I have been at a loose end ever since my tutor went home on leave , and Father would have liked me to go to this school for revision until he gets back next year and I can be taught privately again ."
家 祖母 因说 ： 一则 家学 里 子弟 太 多 ， 恐怕 大家 淘气 ， 反 不好 ， 二则 也 因 我 病 了 几天 ， 遂 暂且 耽搁 着 。,"But Grandmother said that with so many boys in the school I should be sure to get up to mischief , and it would do me more harm than good . She also said I could not in any case go then , because I would only just recovered after several days in bed . And so it got put off . '"
如此说来 ， 尊翁 如今 也 为 此事 悬心 ， 今日 回去 ， 何不 禀明 、 就 在 我们 这 敝塾 中 来 ？,"' From what you say , your father is worried about the same problem as mine ; so why not tell him about this school when you get back today and ask him if you can join ?"
我 也 相伴 ， 彼此 有益 ， 岂不是 好事 ？ ”,"I should be there to keep you company , and we could both help each other . I think it would be a marvellous idea . '"
秦钟笑 道 ： “ 家父 前日 在家 提起 延师 一事 ， 也 曾 提起 这里 的 义学 倒好 ， 原要 来 和 这里 的 老爷 商议 引荐 ；,"' The other day when the question of engaging a tutor came up , Father mentioned this school of yours as a possible alternative , ' said Qin Zhong . ' He was going to come over and have a word with my sister 's father-in-law about it and get him to recommend me ;"
因 这里 又 有事 忙 ， 不便 为 这 点子 小事 来 絮聒 。,but they were busy here at the time and it did not seem the right moment to bother them with a little thing like this .
二叔 果然 度量 侄儿 或 可 磨墨 洗砚 ， 何不 速速 作成 ， 彼此 不致 荒废 ， 既 可以 常 相聚 谈 ， 又 可以 慰 父母 之 心 ， 又 可以 得 朋友 之 乐 ， 岂不是 美事 ？ ”,"However , if you are really of the opinion that I could be of some service to you , even if it is only grinding your ink or cleaning your ink-stone , do please arrange it as soon as you can , before we both get too rusty ! We should be relieving our parents of an anxiety and having the pleasure of each other 's company at one and the same time ; so it would be a good arrangement from every point of view . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 放心 ， 放心 ！,' Do not worry ! ' said Bao-yu .
咱们 回来 告诉 你 姐夫 姐姐 和琏 二 嫂子 ， 今日 你 就 回家 禀明 令尊 ， 我 回去 禀明 了 祖母 ， 再 无不 速成 之 理 。 ”,"' I will tell Cousin Lian 's wife presently , when we join the others . Then when we get back home tonight , you must tell your father and I shall tell my grandmother . There is no reason that I can see why this should not be settled immediately . '"
二人 计议 已 定 ， 那 天气 已 是 掌灯 时分 ， 出来 又 看 他们 玩 了 一回 牌 ， 算账 时 ， 却 又 是 秦氏 尤氏 二人 输 了 戏酒 的 东道 ， 言定 后日 吃 这 东道 ， 一面 又 吃 了 晚饭 。,"They had concluded their discussion in gathering dusk , and now moved back into the lamplit outer room and watched the ladies at their cards for a while . When the latter had finished and had added up their scores , it appeared that Qin-shi and You-shi had lost to Xifeng and owed her a dramatic entertainment at which the players and the drinks were to be provided at their expense . In the course of dinner , which was now served and at which they were joined by the two boys , it was decided that this should take place in two days ' time ."
因 天黑 了 ， 尤氏 说 ： “ 派 两个 小子 送 了 秦 哥儿 家 去 。 ”,"As it was now quite dark , You-shi gave her women orders to see that two menservants were detailed to attend Qin Zhong on his way back home ."
媳妇 们 传出去 半日 。 秦钟 告辞 起身 ， 尤氏 问 ： “ 派 谁 送 去 ？ ”,The women were gone on their errand an unusually long time and eventually Qin Zhong rose to take his leave . ' Who has been chosen to go with him ? ' You-shi asked .
媳妇 们 回说 ： “ 外头 派 了 焦大 ， 谁知 焦大醉 了 ， 又 骂 呢 。 ”,"' They have asked Big Jiao , ' said the women , ' but it seems that he is terribly drunk and swearing at everybody . '"
尤氏 秦氏 都 道 ： “ 偏 又 派 他 作 什么 ？,You-shi and Qin-shi were indignant . ' Whatever did they want to go and ask hi for ?
那个 小子 派 不得 ？,Any of the younger ones would have done .
偏 又 惹 他 ！ ”,What was the point of provoking him ? '
凤姐 道 ： “ 成日 家 说 ， 你 太软弱 了 ， 纵 的 家里人 这样 ， 还 了得 吗 ？ ”,"' I always said you were too soft with people , ' said Xi-feng . ' You really must not let servants get away with it like this . I never heard of such a thing ! '"
尤氏 道 ： “ 你 难道 不知 这 焦大 的 ？,"' You do not know Big Jiao , ' said You-shi ."
连 老爷 都 不理 他 ， 你 珍大 哥哥 也 不理 他 。,"' Even Father could not do anything with him , let alone Zhen ."
因 他 从小儿 跟着 太爷 出过 三四回 兵 ， 从 死 人堆 里 把 太爷 背 出来 了 ， 才 得 了 命 ；,When he was young he went with great-grandfather on three or four of his campaigns and once saved his life by pulling him from under a heap of corpses and carrying him to safety on his back .
自己 挨着 饿 ， 却 偷 了 东西 给 主子 吃 ， 两日 没水 ， 得 了 半碗 水 ， 给 主子 喝 ， 他 自己 喝 马 溺 ：,"He went hungry himself and stole things for his master to eat ; and once when he had managed to get half a cupful of water , he gave it to his master and drank horse 's urine himself ."
不过 仗 着 这些 功劳 情分 ， 有 祖宗 时 ， 都 另眼相待 ， 如今 谁肯 难 为 他 ？ 他 自己 又 老 了 ， 又 不顾 体面 ， 一味 的 好 酒 ， 喝醉 了 无人 不 骂 。,Because of these one or two acts of heroism he was always given special treatment during great-grandfather 's lifetime ; so naturally we do not like to upset him now But since he is grown old he has let himself go completely .
我 常 说 给 管事 的 ： 以后 不用 派 他 差使 ， 只当 他 是 个 死 的 就 完 了 。,"He drinks all the time , and when he is drunk he starts abusing everybody - literally everybody . I have repeatedly told the steward not to give him jobs to do - to behave exactly as though he were dead and ignore him completely ."
今儿 又 派 了 他 ！ ”,Why on earth should he have chosen him today ? '
凤姐 道 ： “ 我 何曾 不知 这 焦大 ？ 到底 是 你们 没主意 ， 何不 远远 的 打发 他 到 庄子 上去 就 完 了 ？ ”,"' I know this Big Jiao all right , ' said Xi-feng , ' and I still say that you are too weak . You ought to send him away Right away . Send him to live on one of your farms : that would put a stop to his nonsense ! '"
说 着 ， 因 问 ： “ 我们 的 车 可 齐备 了 ？ ”,She turned to the women and asked if her own carriage was ready yet .
众 媳妇 们 说 ： “ 伺候 齐 了 。 ”,"The women replied that it was waiting , and she rose to take her leave and , taking Baoyu by the hand , went out on to the steps , attended by You-shi and the rest ."
凤姐 也 起身 告辞 ， 和 宝玉 携手 同行 。 尤氏 等 送 至 大厅 前 ， 见 灯火辉煌 ， 众 小厮 都 在 丹墀 侍立 。 那 焦大 又 恃 贾珍 不 在家 ， 因 趁着 酒兴 ， 先 骂 大 总管 ｛ 赖升 ｝ ， 说 他 ： “ 不 公道 ， 欺软怕硬 ！,"In the flickering light of many lanterns the pages stood stiffly to attention on the pavement below , while Big Jiao , encouraged by Cousin Zhen 's absence to indulge his talent for drunken abuse , was getting to work on the Chief Steward , Lai Sheng , accusing him of being unfair , of always dropping on the weakest , and so on and so forth ."
有 好 差使 派 了 别人 ； 这样 黑更半夜 送 人 ， 就 派 我 ， 没良心 的 忘八 羔子 ！,"' If there is a cushy job going you give it to someone else , but when it is a question of seeing someone home in pitch bloody darkness , you pick on me . Mean , rotten bugger !"
瞎充 管家 ！,Call yourself a steward ? Some steward !
你 也 不 想想 焦大 太爷 跷起 一只 腿 ， 比 你 的 头 还 高 些 。,Do not you know who Old Jiao is ? I can lift my foot up higher than your head !
二十年 头里 的 焦大 太爷 眼里 有 谁 ？ 别说 你们 这 一把子 的 杂种 们 ！ ”,"Twenty years ago I did not give a damn for anybody , never mind a pack of little misbegotten abortions like you ! '"
正 骂 得 兴头上 ， 贾蓉送 凤姐 的 车 出来 ， 众人 喝 他 不住 ， 贾蓉 忍不住 便 骂 了 几句 ， 叫 人 ： “ 捆起来 ！,"He was just getting into his stride when Jia Rong came out to see Xi-feng off in her carriage . The servants shouted to Big Jiao to stop , but without success . Impatient of the old man 's insolence , Jia Rong cursed him angrily . ' Tie him up , ' he said to the servants ."
等 明日 酒醒 了 ， 再 问 他 还 寻死 不 寻死 ！ ”,"' We shall see if he is still so eager for death tomorrow morning , when he has sobered up a bit . '"
那 焦大 那里 有 贾蓉 在 眼里 ？,But Big Jiao was not to be intimidated by such as Jia Rong .
反 大叫 起来 ， 赶着 贾蓉 叫 ： “ 蓉 哥儿 ， 你 别 在 焦大 跟前 使 主子 性儿 ！,"On the contrary , he staggered up to him and bellowed even louder . ' Oh ho ! Little Rong , is it ? Do not you come the Big Master stuff with me , sonny boy !"
别说 你 这样儿 的 ， 就是 你 爹 、 你 爷爷 ， 也 不敢 和 焦大 挺 腰子 呢 ！,"Never mind a little bit of a kid like you , even your daddy and your granddaddy do not dare to try any funny stuff with Old Jiao ."
不是 焦大 一个 人 ， 你们 作 官儿 ， 享 荣华 ， 受 富贵 ！,"If it was not for Old Jiao , where would you lot all be today , with your rank and your fancy titles and your money and all the other things you enjoy ?"
你 祖宗 九死一生 挣下 这个 家业 ， 到 如今 不报 我 的 恩 ， 反 和 我 充起 主子 来 了 。,"It was your great-grandfather , whose life I saved when he was given up for dead , that won all this for you , by the sweat of his brow . And what reward do I get for saving him ? Nothing . Instead you come to me and you put on your Big Master act ."
不 和 我 说 别的 还 可 ， 再说 别的 ， 咱们 白 刀子 进去 ， 红 刀子 出来 ！ ”,"Well , I will tell you something . You would better watch out . Because if you do not , you are going to get a shiny white knife inside you , and it is going to come out red ! '"
凤姐 在 车上 和 贾蓉 说 ： “ 还 不 早些 打发 了 没 王法 的 东西 ！,"' You would better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business , ' said Xi-feng to Jia Rong from her carriage ."
留在 家里 ， 岂不是 害 ？,It is positively dangerous to keep a man like this on the premises .
亲友 知道 ， 岂 不 笑话 咱们 这样 的 人家 ， 连 个 规矩 都 没有 ？ ”,"If any of our acquaintance get to know that a family like ours can not keep even a semblance of discipline about the place , we shall become a laughing-stock . '"
贾蓉 答应 了 “ 是 ” 。,Jia Rong assented meekly .
众人 见 他 太 撒野 ， 只得 上来 了 几个 ， 揪 翻 捆 倒 ， 拖往 马 圈里 去 。,"Several of the servants , seeing that Big Jiao had got quite out of hand and that something had to be done at all costs , rushed up and overpowered him , and throwing him face downward on the ground , frog-marched him off to the stables ."
焦大 益发 连贾珍 都 说 出来 ， 乱 嚷 乱叫 ， 说 ： “ 要 往 祠堂 里 哭 太爷 去 ， 那里 承望 到 如今 生 下 这些 畜生 来 ！,"By now even Cousin Zhen was being included in his maledictions , which became wilder and noisier as he shouted to his captors that he wanted to go to the ancestral temple and weep before the tablet of his old Master . ' Who would ever have believed the Old Master could spawn this filthy lot of animals ? ' he bawled ."
每日 偷狗戏鸡 ， 爬灰 的 爬灰 ， 养 小叔子 的 养 小叔子 ， 我 什么 不 知道 ？,' Up to their dirty little tricks every day . I know . Father-in-law pokes in the ashes . Auntie has it off with nevvy . Do you think I do not know what you are all up to ?
咱们 ‘ 胳膊 折 了 往 袖子 里藏 ’ ！ ”,"Oh , we "" hide our broken arm in our sleeve "" ; but you do not fool me . '"
众 小厮 见 说 出来 的话 有天没日 的 ， 唬得 魂飞魄丧 ， 把 他 捆起来 ， 用土 和 马粪 满满的 填 了 他 一 嘴 。,"Terrified out of their wits at hearing a fellow-servant utter such enormities , the grooms and pages tied him up and stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung ."
凤姐 和 贾蓉 也 遥遥 的 听见 了 ， 都 装作 没 听见 。,"Big Jiao is last words had been clearly audible to Xi-feng and Jia Rong , though they were a considerable distance away , but they both pretended not to have heard ."
宝玉 在 车上 听见 ， 因 问 凤姐 道 ： “ 姐姐 ， 你 听 他 说 ‘ 爬灰 的 爬灰 ’ ， 这 是 什么 话 ？ ”,"Bao-yu , sitting in the carriage with Xi-feng , was less inhibited . ' Feng , what did he mean when he said "" Father-in-law pokes in the ashes "" ? '"
凤姐 连忙 喝道 ： “ 少 胡说 ！,"' Hold your tongue ! ' Xi-feng snapped back at him , livid ."
那 是 醉汉 嘴里 胡唚 ， 你 是 什么样 的 人 ， 不说 没 听见 ， 还 倒 细问 ！,"It is bad enough for a person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth , but to go asking questions about it , really !"
等 我 回 了 太太 ， 看 是 捶 你 不 捶 你 ！ ”,Just wait till I tell your mother ! You are going to get the biggest hiding you have ever had in your life !
吓 得 宝玉 连忙 央告 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 我 再 不敢 说 这些 话 了 。 ”,"Terrified by her vehemence , Bao-yu implored forgiveness . ' Please , Feng , do not tell her ! I promise never to say those words again . '"
凤姐 哄 他 道 ： “ 好 兄弟 ， 这 才 是 呢 。,Xi-feng 's manner at once became soothing and indulgent . ' That is my good little cuzzy !
等 回去 咱们 回 了 老太太 ， 打发 人 到 家学 里 去 说明 了 ， 请 了 秦 钟学 里 念书 去 要紧 。 ”,When we get back I must tell Grandma to make them explain to the school about Qin Zhong and arrange for him to be admitted soon . '
说 着 自回 荣府 而 来 。,"As they talked , the carriage bore them back into Rong-guo House ."
要知 端的 ， 下回分解 。,But what happened there will be told in the chapter which follows .
第八回,Chapter 8
贾宝玉 奇缘 识金 锁,Jia Bao-yu is allowed to see the strangely corresponding golden locket
薛宝钗 巧合 认通 灵,And Xve Bao-chai has a predestined encounter with the Magic Jade
话 说 宝玉 和凤姐 回家 ， 见 过 众人 ， 宝玉 便 回 明贾母 要约 秦钟 上 家塾 之 事 ， 自己 也 有 个 伴读 的 朋友 ， 正好 发愤 ， 又 着实 称赞 秦钟 人品 行事 ， 最 是 可 人 怜爱 的 。,"When Bao-yu and Xi-feng were back and had seen the others , Bao-yu told Grandmother Jia of his wish to have Qin Zhong admitted to the clan school . He pointed out that a congenial study-companion would stimulate him to greater effort and gave her a glowing account of Qin Zhong 's amiable qualities ."
凤姐 又 在 一旁 帮 着 说 ： “ 改日 秦钟 还 来 拜见 老祖宗 呢 。 ”,Xi-feng was at hand to lend her support . She told Grandmother Jia that Qin Zhong would be calling on her within a day or two to pay his respects .
说 的 贾母喜 欢 起来 。 凤姐 又 趁势 请 贾母 一同 过去 看戏 。,"Their infectious enthusiasm put the old lady in a high good humour , which Xi-feng took advantage of to ask if she would accompany her to the dramatic entertainment which her opponents had promised in two days ' time ."
贾母 虽 年 高 ， 却 极 有 兴头 。 后 日 ， 尤氏 来 请 ， 遂 带 了 王夫人 、 黛玉 、 宝玉 等 过去 看戏 。,"In spite of her years Grandmother Jia loved any kind of excitement and when , two days later , You-shi came to fetch Xi-feng , the old lady did in fact accompany them , taking Lady Wang , Dai-yu and Bao-yu as well ."
至 晌午 ， 贾母 便 回来 歇息 。 王夫人 本好 清净 ， 见 贾母 回来 ， 也 就 回来 了 。,"By about noon , however , she was ready to go back and rest , and Lady Wang , who disliked noise and excitement , took the opportunity to leave with her ."
然后 凤姐 坐 了 首席 ， 尽欢 至晚 而罢 。,"This left Xi-feng as principal guest , and she moved into the place of honour and stayed there for the rest of the day , enjoying herself immensely and not returning until late in the evening ."
却说 宝玉 送 贾母 回来 ， 待 贾母 歇 了 中觉 ， 还要 回去 看戏 ， 又 恐 搅 的 秦氏 等 人 不便 ， 因 想起 宝钗 近日 在家 养病 ， 未 去 看视 ， 意欲 去 望 他 ； 若 从 上房 后 角门 过去 ， 恐怕 遇见 别事 缠绕 ， 又 怕 遇见 他 父亲 ， 更为 不妥 ， 宁可 绕 个 远 儿 。,"After accompanying Grandmother Jia back to her apartment and seeing her safely-settled down for her nap , Bao-yu would have liked to go back and watch some more plays but was afraid that his presence would be an inconvenience to Qinshi and his other juniors ' . Remembering that Bao-chai had been at home unwell during the past few days and that he had still not been to see her , he thought he would go there instead and pay her a call , but fearing that if he went the quickest way through the corner gate behind the main hall he might meet with some entanglement on the way or , worse , run into his father , he decided to go by a more circuitous route ."
当下 众 嬷嬷 丫鬟 伺候 他 换衣服 ， 见 不曾 换 ， 仍 出 二门 去 了 ； 众 嬷嬷 丫鬟 只得 跟随 出来 ； 还 只当 他 去 那边 府 中 看戏 ， 谁知 到 了 穿堂 儿 ， 便 向东 北边 绕过 厅 后 而 去 。,"The maids and nurses who attended him had been expecting him to change into his everyday clothes , but seeing him go out of the inner gate again without doing so , followed after him , assuming that he was going back to the other mansion to watch the plays . To their surprise , however , he turned left when he reached the covered passage-way instead of going straight on , and made off in a north-easterly direction ."
偏 顶头 遇见 了 门下 清客 相公 詹光 、 单聘仁 二人 走来 ， 一 见 了 宝玉 ， 便 都 赶上来 ， 笑 着 ， 一个 抱 着 腰 ， 一个 拉 着手 ， 道 ： “ 我 的 菩萨 哥儿 ！,"But he was out of luck , for as he did so he found himself facing Zhan Guang and Shan Pin-ren , two of the literary gentlemen patronized by his father , who were walking towards him from the opposite direction . They descended on him gleefully , one of them clasping him round the waist , the other taking him by a hand . ' Angelic boy !"
我 说 做 了 好 梦 呢 ， 好容易 遇见 你 了 ！ ”,"How seldom one has the pleasure ! Is it really you , or is this some delightful dream ? '"
说 着 ， 又 唠叨 了 半日 ， 才 走开 。,They prattled on for what seemed an age before finally releasing him .
老嬷嬷 叫住 ， 因 问 ： “ 你们 二位 是 往 老爷 那里 去 的 不是 ？ ”,"As they were going , one of the old nurses detained them a moment longer . ' Have you two gentlemen just come from the Master 's ? '"
二人 点头 道 ： “ 是 。 ” 又 笑 着 说 ： “ 老爷 在 梦 坡 斋 小 书房 里 歇 中觉 呢 ， 不妨 事 的 。 ”,"The two gentlemen nodded and smiled conspiratorially : ' Sir Zheng is in his little study in the Su Dong-po Rooms , having his afternoon nap . All is well ! '"
一面 说 ， 一面 走 了 。,They hurried off .
说 的 宝玉 也 笑 了 ； 于是 转弯 向 北奔梨 香院 来 。,"Bao-yu smiled too , relieved that his father was safely out of the way . Turning once again , this time north-wards , he made his way swiftly towards Pear Tree Court ."
可巧 管 库房 的 总领 吴新登 和 仓 上 的 头目 名叫 戴良 的 ， 同着 几个 管事 的 头目 ， 共 七个 人 ， 从 账房 里 出来 ， 一 见 宝玉 ， 赶忙 都 一齐 垂手 站立 ；,"Once more he was unlucky . The Clerk of Stores Wu Xin-deng , a man called Dai Liang who was foreman at the granary , and five other foremen were just at that moment coming out of the counting-house together and , catching sight of Bao-yu , at once stood respectfully to attention ."
独有 一个 买办 ， 名唤 钱华 ， 因 他 多日未见 宝玉 ， 忙 上来 打千 儿 请 宝玉 的 安 ， 宝玉 含笑 伸手 叫 他 起来 。,"One of their number , a buyer called Qian Hua who had not seen Bao-yu for some considerable time , hurried forward , dropped on his right knee , and touched his hand to the ground in the Manchu salute . Bao-yu smilingly extended a hand to raise him up ."
众人 都 笑 说 ： “ 前儿 在 一处 看见 二爷 写 的 斗方 儿 ， 越发 好 了 ， 多早晚 赏 我们 几 张贴 贴 。 ”,"The men all relaxed in smiles . ' I saw some of your calligraphy in town the other day , Master Bao , ' said one of them . ' It is getting really good ! When are you going to give us a few sheets for ourselves , to put up on the wall ? '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 在 那里 看见 了 ？ ”,' Where did you see it ? ' Bao-yu asked .
众人 道 ： “ 好几处 都 有 ， 都 称赞 的 了不得 ， 还 和 我们 寻 呢 ！ ”,"' Any number of places , ' the men told him . ' Everyone has been praising it no end . They even come to us asking for specimens . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 不值 什么 ， 你们 说 给 我 的 小么儿 们 就是 了 。 ”,"' You can have some easily enough if you really want to , ' Bao-yu said . ' You have only to ask one of my boys . '"
一面 说 ， 一 面前 走 ， 众人 待 他 过去 ， 方都 各自 散 了 。,He hurried on . The men waited for him to pass before dispersing about their business .
闲 言少述 ， 且说 宝玉 来 至 梨香 院中 ， 先进 薛姨妈 屋里 来 ， 见 薛姨妈 打点 针黹 与 丫鬟 们 呢 ；,"To omit further details of his progress , Bao-yu came at last to Pear Tree Court , and going first into Aunt Xue is room , found her giving instructions to her maids about some embroidery ."
宝玉 忙 请 了 安 ， 薛姨妈 一把 拉 住 ， 抱 人 怀中 笑 说 ： “ 这么 冷天 ， 我 的 儿 ！ 难 为 你 想着 来 。,"Her response to his greeting was to draw him towards her and clasp him to her bosom in an affectionate embrace . ' What a nice , kind boy to think of us on a cold day like this !"
快 上 炕 来 坐 着 罢 。 ”,Come up on the kang and get warm ! '
命人 ： “ 沏 滚滚 的 茶 来 。 ”,She ordered a maid to bring him some ' boiling hot tea ' .
宝玉 因 问 ： “ 哥哥 没 在家 么 ？ ”,Bao-yu inquired whether Cousin Pan was at home .
薛姨妈 叹 道 ： “ 他 是 没 笼头 的 马 ， 天天 逛 不了 ， 那里 肯 在家 一日 呢 ？ ”,Aunt Xue sighed . ' Pan is like a riderless horse : always of enjoying himself somewhere or other . He will not spend a single day at home if he can help it .
宝玉 道 ： “ 姐姐 可 大安 了 ？ ”,' What about Bao-chai ? Is she quite better ? '
薛姨妈 道 ： “ 可是 呢 ！,"' Ah yes , of course ! ' said Aunt Xue ."
你 前儿 又 想着 打发 人 来 瞧 他 。,"' You sent someone to ask about her the other day , did not you ?"
他 在 里间 不是 ， 你 去 瞧 。,That was very thoughtful of you . I think she is inside . Go in and have a look !
他 那里 比 这里 暖和 ， 你 那里 坐 着 ， 我 收拾 收拾 就 进来 和 你 说话 儿 。 ”,"Its warmer in there than here . You go in and sit down , and I will be with you in a moment when Ive finished tidying up . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 忙 下炕 来到 了 里间 门前 ， 只见 吊 着 半旧 的 红纳 软帘 。,"Bao-yu got down from the kang and going to the doorway of the inner room , lifted up the rather worn-looking red silk curtain which covered it ."
宝玉 掀 帘 一步 进去 ， 先 就 看见 宝钗 坐在 炕上 作 针线 ， 头上 挽着 黑漆 油光 的 鬟 儿 ， 蜜合色 的 棉袄 ， 玫瑰紫 二色 金银线 的 坎肩 儿 ， 葱黄 绫子 棉裙 ：,"Bao-chai was sitting on the kang inside , sewing . Her lustrous black hair was done up in a simple bun without any kind of ornament . She was wearing a honey-coloured padded gown , a mulberry-coloured sleeveless jacket with a pattern in gold and silver thread , and a greenish-yellow padded skirt ."
一色 儿 半新不旧 的 ， 看 去 不见 奢华 ， 惟 觉 雅淡 。,"All her clothing had the same sensible , rather well-worn look about it . He saw no hint of Iuxury or show , only a chaste , refined sobriety ;"
罕言寡语 ， 人 谓 装 愚 ；,to some her studied taciturnity might seem to savour of duplicity ;
安分 随时 ， 自 云 “ 守拙 ” 。,but she herself saw in conformity the means of guarding her simplicity .
宝玉 一面 看 ， 一面 问 ： “ 姐姐 可大愈了 ？ ”,"' Have you quite recovered , cousin ? ' Bao-yu asked ."
宝钗 抬头 看见 宝玉 进来 ， 连忙 起身 含笑 答道 ： “ 已经 大好 了 ， 多谢 惦记着 。 ”,"Raising her head , Bao-chai saw Bao-yu enter the room . She rose quickly to her feet and smiled at him . ' I am quite better now . It was nice of you to think of me . '"
说 着 ， 让 他 在 炕沿 上 坐下 ， 即令 莺 儿 ： “ 倒 茶 来 。 ”,She made him sit on the edge of the kang and ordered Oriole to pour him some tea .
一面 又 问 老太太 姨娘 安 ， 又 问 别的 姐妹 们 好 ； 一面 看 宝玉 头上 戴 着 累丝 嵌 宝紫 金冠 ， 额 上 勒 着 二龙 捧 珠 抹额 ， 身上 穿着 秋香色 立蟒 白狐 腋箭袖 ， 系 着 五色 蝴蝶 鸾 绦 ， 项上 挂 着 长命锁 、 记名 符 ， — — 另外 有 那 一块 落草 时衔 下来 的 宝玉 。,"Then she proceeded to ask him first about Grandmother Jia , then about Lady Wang and then about the girls , while her eye took in the details of his dress . He had a little jewel-encrusted coronet of gold filigree on the top of his head and a circlet in the form of two dragons supporting a pearl round his brow . He was dressed in a narrow-sleeved , full-skirted robe of russet-green material covered with a pattern of writhing dragons and lined and trimmed with white fox-fur . A butterfly-embroidered sash with fringed ends was fastened round his waist , and from his neck hung a padlock-shaped amulet , a lucky charm , and the famous jade said to have been inside his mouth when he was born . Bao-chai 's eye came to rest on the jade ."
宝钗因 笑 说道 ： “ 成日 家 说 你 的 这块 玉 ， 究竟 未曾 细细的 赏鉴 过 ， 我 今儿 倒 要 瞧瞧 。 ”,"' I am always hearing about this famous stone of yours . ' she said smilingly , ' but I have never yet had a chance of examining it really closely . Today I think I should like to have a look . '"
说 着 便 挪近 前来 。 宝玉 亦 凑 过去 ， 便 从 项上 摘下来 ， 递 在 宝钗 手内 。,"She moved forward as she spoke , and Bao-yu too leaned towards her , and taking the stone from his neck , put it into her hand ."
宝钗托 在 掌上 ， 只见 大如雀卵 ， 灿若明霞 ， 莹润 如 酥 ， 五色 花纹 缠护 。,"Looking at it as it lay on her palm , she saw a stone about the size of a sparrow 's egg , glowing with the suppressed , milky radiance of a sunlit cloud and veined with iridescent streaks of colour ."
看官 们 须 知道 ， 这 就是 大 荒山 中青 填峰 下 的 那块 顽石 幻相 ， 后人 有 诗 嘲 云 ：,"Reader , you will , of course , remember that this jade was a transformation of that same great stone block which once lay at the foot of Greensickness Peak in the Great Fable Mountains . A certain jesting poet has written these verses about it :"
女娲 炼石 已 荒唐 ，,Nii-wa 's stone-smelting is a tale unfounded :
又 向 荒唐 演 大荒 。,On such weak fancies our Great Fable 's grounded .
失去 本来 真面目 ，,"Lost now , alack ! and gone Iny heavenly stone -"
幻来 新 就 臭皮囊 。,Transformed to this vile bag of flesh and bone .
好知 运败 金无彩 ，,"For , in misfortune , gold no longer gleams ;"
堪叹 时乖 玉 不光 。,"And bright jade , when fate frowns , lack-lustre seems ."
白骨 如 山 忘 姓氏 ，,Heaped charnel-bones none can identify
无非 公子 与 红妆 。,Here golden girls and bays in days gone by .
那 顽石 亦 曾 记下 他 这 幻相 并 癞僧 所 镌 篆文 ， 今 亦 按 图画 于 后面,The words which the scabby-headed monk had incised on the stone when he found it lying in its diminished shape under Greensickness Peak were as follows .
［ ， — — 但其 真体 最小 ， 方 从 胎 中 小儿 口中 衔下 ， 今 若 按式 画 出 ， 恐 字迹 过于 微细 ， 使 观者 大 废 眼光 ， 亦非 畅 事 ， 所以 略 展放 些 ， 以便 灯 下 醉 中 可阅 。,
今 注明 此 故 ， 方 不至 以 胎 中 之 儿口 有 多 大 、 怎 得 衔 此 狼犺 蠢大之物 为 诮 ］ 。,
通灵宝玉 正面,( On the front side )
,MAGIC JADE
,"Muslay me not , forget me not ,"
,And hale old age shall be your lot .
通灵宝玉 反面,( On the reverse side )
,1 . Dispels the harms of witchcraft .
,2 . Cures melancholic distempers .
,3 . Foretells good and evil fortune .
宝钗 看毕 ， 又 从 新 翻过 正面 来 细看 ， 口里 念道 ： “ 莫失 莫忘 ， 仙 寿恒昌 。 ”,"When Bao-chai had looked at the stone all over , she turned back to the inscription on the front and repeated it a couple of times to herself out loud : ' Mislay me not , forget me not , And hale old age shall be your lot . '"
念 了 两遍 ， 乃 回头 向莺儿 笑 道 ： “ 你 不 去 倒 茶 ， 也 在 这里 发呆 作 什么 ？ ”,' Why are not you pouring the tea ? ' she asked Oriole . ' What are you standing there gawping for ? '
莺 儿 也 嘻嘻 的 笑道 ： “ 我 听 这 两句话 ， 倒象 和 姑娘 项圈 上 的 两句话 是 一对 儿 。 ”,Oriole laughed . ' Because those words sounded like a perfect match to the ones on your necklace . '
宝玉 听 了 ， 忙 笑 道 ： “ 原来 姐姐 那 项圈 上 也 有 字 ？,"' So you have an inscription , too ? ' said Bao-yu pricking up his ears ."
我 也 赏鉴 赏鉴 。 ”,' I must have a look . '
宝钗 道 ： “ 你 别 听 他 的话 ， 没有 什么 字 。 ”,' Do not take any notice of herl said Bao-chai . ' There is no inscription . '
宝玉 央及 道 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 你 怎么 瞧 我 的 呢 ！ ”,"' Cousin , cousin , ' said Bao-yu entreatingly , you have had a look at mine . Be fair ! '"
宝钗 被 他 缠 不过 ， 因 说道 ： “ 也 是 个人 给 了 两句 吉利 话儿 ， 錾 上 了 ， 所以 天天 带 着 ； 不然 沉甸甸 的 ， 有 什么 趣儿 ？ ”,"Bao-chai could not escape the logic of this entreaty . ' There is a motto on it which someone gave us once for luck and which we had engraved on it , ' she admitted . ' That is the only reason I always wear it ; otherwise it would be too tiresome to have a heavy thing like this hanging round one 's neck all the time . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 解 了 排扣 ， 从 里面 大红 袄 儿 上将 那 珠宝 晶莹 、 黄金 灿烂 的 璎珞 摘出来 。,"As she was speaking she undid the top buttons of her jacket and gown and extracted the necklace that she was wearing over the dark red shift beneath . Its pendant was a locket of shining solid gold , bordered with sparkling gems ."
宝玉 忙 托 着 锁 看 时 ， 果然 一面 有 四个 字 ， 两面 八个 字 ， 共成 两句 吉 谶 。,There was a line of writing engraved on either side of it which together made up the words of a charm :
［ 一一 亦 曾 按 式画 下 形相 ： ］,
金锁 正面,
,"Ne ' er leave me , ne ' er abandon me :"
金锁 反面,
,And years of health shall be your fee .
宝玉 看 了 ， 也 念 了 两遍 ， 又 念 自己 的 两遍 ， 因 笑 问 ： “ 姐姐 ， 这 八个 字 倒 和 我 的 是 一对 儿 。 ”,"He recited them a couple of times and then recited the words of his own inscription a couple of times . ' Why , yes ! ' he cried delightedly . ' The two inscriptions are a perfect match ! '"
莺 儿 笑 道 ： “ 是 个 癞头 和尚 送 的 ， 他 说 必须 錾 在 金器 上 — — ”,"' A scabby-headed old monk gave Miss Bao-chai the words , ' said Oriole . ' He said they must be engraved on something made of gold . . . '"
宝钗 不等 他 说完 ， 便 嗔着 不 去 倒 茶 ， 一面 又 问宝玉 从 那里 来 。,"Bao-chai angrily cut her short , telling her to mind her business and pour the tea . To change the subject she asked Bao-yu where he had just come from ."
宝玉 此时 与 宝钗 挨肩 坐 着 ， 只 闻 一阵阵 的 香气 ， 不知 何味 ， 遂 问 ： “ 姐姐 熏 的 是 什么 香 ？,"Bao-yu was now sitting almost shoulder to shoulder with her and as he did so became aware of a penetrating fragrance that seemed to emanate from her person . ' What incense do you use to scent your clothes with , cousin ? ' he asked ."
我 竟 没 闻 过 这 味儿 。 ”,' I have never smelt such a delicious perfume . '
宝钗 道 ： “ 我 最怕 熏香 ！,"' I can not stand incense perfumes , ' said Bao-chai ."
好好儿 的 衣裳 ， 为什么 熏 他 ？ ”,"' I could never see the point of smoking perfectly good , clean clothes over an incense-pot . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 那么 着 这 是 什么 香 呢 ？ ”,"' In that case , what is this perfume I can smell ? '"
宝钗 想 了 想 ， 说 ： “ 是 了 ！,Bao-chai thought for a moment . ' I know !
是 我 早起 吃 了 冷 香丸 的 香气 。 ”,It must be the Cold Fragrance Pill I took this morning . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 什么 ‘ 冷 香丸 ’ ， 这么 好闻 ？,' What is a Cold Fragrance Pill ? ' said Bao-yu with a laugh .
好 姐姐 ， 给 我 一丸 尝尝 呢 。 ”,' Will not you give me one to try ? '
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 又 混闹 了 。,' Now you are being silly again .
一个 药 也 是 混吃 的 ？ ”,Medicine is not something to be taken for amusement . '
一 语 未了 ， 忽 听 外面 人 说 ： “ 林姑娘 来 了 。 ” 话 犹 未 完 ， 黛玉 已 摇摇摆摆 的 进来 ， 一 见 宝玉 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 哎哟 ！,Just at that moment the servants outside announced ' Miss Lin ' and almost simultaneously Dai-yu came flouncing into the room . Catching sight of Bao-yu she let out a wail of mock dismay .
我 来 的 不巧 了 ！ ”,' Oh dear ! I have chosen a bad time to come ! '
宝玉 等 忙 起身 让 坐 ， 宝钗笑 道 ： “ 这 是 怎么 说 ？ ”,The others rose and invited her to be seated . ' Why did you say that ? ' Bao-chai asked her .
黛玉 道 ： “ 早知 他 来 ， 我 就 不来 了 。 ”,"' If I had known ke was coming , I should not have come myself . '"
宝钗 道 ： “ 这 是 什么 意思 ？ ”,' What exactly do you mean by that ? '
黛玉 道 ： “ 什么 意思 呢 ： 来 呢 一齐 来 ， 不 来 一个 也 不来 ；,"' What do I mean by that ? ' said Dai-yu . ' I mean that if I only come when he does , then when I do not come you will not have any visitors ."
今儿 他 来 ， 明儿 我 来 ， 间 错开 了来 ， 岂 不 天天 有人 来 呢 ？ 也 不至 太 冷落 ， 也 不至 太 热闹 。,"Whereas if we space ourselves out so that he comes one day and I come the next , it will never get either too lonely or too noisy for you ."
— — 姐姐 有 什么 不解 的 呢 ？ ”,I should not have thought that needed much explaining . '
宝玉 因见 他 外面 罩 着 大红 羽缎 对襟 褂子 ， 便 问 ： “ 下雪 了 么 ？ ”,"Observing that Dai-yu was wearing a greatcoat of red camlet over her dress , Bao-yu asked whether it was snowing outside ."
地下 老婆 们 说 ： “ 下 了 这 半日 了 。 ”,"It is been snowing for some time , said one of the old women standing below the kang . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 取 了 我 的 斗篷 来 。 ”,Bao-yu asked someone to go and fetch his winter cape .
黛玉 便 笑 道 ： “ 是不是 ？,' You see ! ' said Dai-yu .
我 来 了 他 就 该 走 了 ！ ”,"' When I come , he has to go ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 何曾 说 要 去 ？,' Who said anything about going ? ' said Bao-yu .
不过 拿来 预备 着 。 ”,' I just want them to have it ready for me . '
宝玉 的 奶母 李嬷嬷 便 说道 ： “ 天 又 下雪 ， 也 要 看 时候 儿 ， 就 在 这里 和 姐姐 妹妹 一处 玩玩儿 罢 。,"' It is no time to go now , while it is still snowing , ' said Bao-yu 's old nurse , Nannie Li. ' Much better stay here and play with your cousins ."
姨太太 那里 摆 茶 呢 。 我 叫 丫头 去取 了 斗篷 来 ， 说 给 小么儿 们 散 了 罢 ？ ”,"In any case , I think your Aunt Xue is getting tea ready for you . I will send a maid to fetch your cape . Shall I tell the boys outside they can go ? '"
宝玉 点头 。 李嬷嬷 出去 ， 命 小厮 们 ： “ 都 散 了 罢 。 ”,"Bao-yu nodded , and Nannie Li went outside and dismissed the pages ."
这里 薛姨妈 已 摆 了 几样 细巧 茶食 ， 留 他们 喝茶 吃 果子 。,"By now Aunt Xue had finished laying tea , which included a number of deliciouslooking things to eat , and invited the cousins to partake ."
宝玉 因 夸 前日 在 东府里 珍 大嫂子 的 好 鹅掌 。,"While they were doing so , Bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by his Cousin Zhen 's wife that he had eaten at the Ning mansion only two days previously ."
薛姨妈 连忙 把 自己 糟 的 取 了 来 给 他 尝 。,Aunt Xue at once hurried out and fetched some of her own for him to try .
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 这个 就 酒 才 好 ！ ”,"' This really needs to be eaten with wine , ' said Bao-yu ."
薛姨妈 便 命 人 灌 了 上 等 酒 来 。 李嬷嬷 上来 道 ： “ 姨太太 ， 酒 倒 罢了 。 ”,"Aunt Xue gave orders for some of the best wine to be decanted ; but Nannie Li disapproved . ' He should not have wine , Mrs Xue . '"
宝玉 笑央 道 ： “ 好 妈妈 ， 我 只 喝 一钟 。 ”,"' Oh go on , Nannie ! ' Bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly . ' I shall only drink one cup . '"
李妈 道 ： “ 不中用 ， 当着 老太太 、 太太 ， 那 怕 你 喝 一坛 呢 ！,' It is no good ! ' said Nannie Li. ' I do not mind if you drink a hogshead as long as your grandmother or your mother is there .
不是 那日 我 眼 错 不见 ， 不知 那个 没 调教 的 ， 只 图 讨 你 的 喜欢 ， 给 了 你 一口 酒 喝 ， 葬送 的 我 挨 了 两天 骂 ！,But look at the trouble I got into the other day just because when I had my back turned for a moment some wretched person who ought to have known better gave you a sip or two to humour you ! I did not hear the end of it for days after .
— — 姨太太 不 知道 他 的 性子 呢 ， 喝了酒 更 弄 性 。,"' You do not know how wild he can be , Mrs Xue , ' she continued . And he gets even worse when he is had something to drink ."
有 一天 老太太 高兴 ， 又 尽 着 他 喝 ； 什么 日子 又 不许 他 喝 ； 何苦 我 白 赔 在 里头 呢 ？ ”,"With Her Old Ladyship you can never tell . One day when she is feeling high-spirited she will let him drink as much as he likes ; other days she will not let him touch a drop . But come what may , I am always the one that gets into trouble . '"
薛姨妈 笑 道 ： “ 老货 ！,' Poor old thing ! ' said Aunt Xue with a laugh .
只管 放心 喝 你 的 去 罢 ！,' Have a drink yourself and stop worrying !
我 也 不许 他 喝多 了 。,I will see that he does not drink too much .
就是 老太太 问 ， 有 我 呢 。 ”,"And if Lady Jia does say anything , I shall take full responsibility . '"
一面 命 小丫头 ： “ 来 ， 让 你 奶奶 去 也 吃 一杯 搪搪 寒气 。 ”,"She turned to one of the maids : ' Come on , now ! Pour Nannie a nice warm cup of wine to keep the cold out !"
那 李妈 听 如此 说 ， 只得 且 和 众人 吃酒 去 。,Nannie Li could scarcely sustain her objection after this and went off with the other servants to have her drink .
这里 宝玉 又 说 ： “ 不必 烫 暖 了 ， 我 只 爱喝 冷 的 。 ”,"' Do not bother to heat the wine for me , said Bao-yu . ' I prefer it cold . '"
薛姨妈 道 ： “ 这 可 使不得 ： 吃 了 冷酒 ， 写字 手 打颤 儿 。 ”,"' Good gracious , that will never do ! ' said Aunt Xue . ' You must not drink wine cold , or when you write your hand will shake ! '"
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 宝兄弟 ， 亏 你 每日 家 杂学旁收 的 ， 难道 就 不 知道 酒性 最 热 ， 要 热 吃 下去 ， 发散 的 就 快 ；,"' I am surprised at you , Cousin Bao ! ' said Bao-chai with a smile . ' With all your enthusiasm for out-of-the-way learning , fancy not knowing a thing like that ! Wine has an exceptionally fiery nature , and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be quickly digested ."
要 冷 吃 下去 ， 便 凝结 在内 ， 拿 五脏 去 暖 他 ， 岂 不 受害 ？,"If it is drunk cold , it congeals inside the body and harms it by absorbing heat from the internal organs ."
从此 还 不 改 了 呢 。,From this day on you must reform !
快别 吃 那 冷 的 了 。 ”,No more cold wine ! '
宝玉 听 这话 有理 ， 便 放下 冷 的 ， 令人 烫来 方饮 。,
黛玉 磕 着 瓜子儿 ， 只管 抿着嘴 儿 笑 。,"Dai-yu , who sat cracking melon-seeds between her teeth throughout this homily , smiled ironically ."
可巧 黛玉 的 丫鬟 雪雁 走来 给 黛玉 送 小 手炉 儿 ， 黛玉 因 含笑 问 他 说 ： “ 谁 叫 你 送来 的 ？,Just at that moment her maid Snowgoose came hurrying in with a little hand-warmer for her . ' Who told you to bring this ? ' Dai-yu asked her .
难 为 他 费心 。,"' Very kind of them , I am sure ."
— — 那里 就 冷 死 我 了 呢 ！ ”,But I was not actually freezing to death here . '
雪雁道 ： “ 紫鹃 姐姐 怕 姑娘 冷 ， 叫 我 送来 的 。 ”,"' Nightingale told me to bring it , Miss . She was afraid you might be cold . '"
黛玉 接 了 ， 抱 在 怀中 ， 笑 道 ： “ 也 亏了 你 倒 听 他 的话 ！,' I am glad you are so ready to obey her .
我 平日 和 你 说 的 ， 全 当耳旁风 ；,Generally when I tell you to do anything it goes in one ear and out the other ;
怎么 他 说 了 你 就 依 ， 比 圣旨 还 快 呢 ！ ”,yet anything she tells you to do is followed out more promptly than an Imperial Edict !
宝玉 听 这话 ， 知 是 黛玉 借此 奚落 ， 也 无 回复 之 词 ， 只 嘻嘻 的 笑 了 一阵 罢了 。,"Bao-yu knew perfectly well that these words were really intended for him , but made no reply , beyond laughing good-humouredly ."
宝钗素 知 黛玉 是 如此 惯 了 的 ， 也 不理 他 。,"Bao-chai , long accustomed to Dai-yu 's peculiar ways , also ignored them ."
薛姨妈 因 笑 道 ： “ 你 素日 身子 单弱 ， 禁 不得 冷 ， 他们 惦记着 你 倒 不好 ？ ”,But Aunt Xue protested . ' You have always been rather delicate and you have always felt the cold badly . Surely it was nice of them to think of you ? '
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 姨妈 不 知道 ： 幸亏 是 姨妈 这里 ， 倘或 在 别人 家 ， 那 不 叫 人家 恼 吗 ？,"' You do not understand , Aunt , ' said Dai-yu . ' It does not matter here , with you ; but some people might be deeply offended at the sight of one of my maids rushing in with a handwarmer ."
难道 人家 连 个 手炉 也 没有 ， 巴巴儿 的 打 家里 送 了 来 ？,It is as though I thought my hosts could not supply one themselves if I needed it .
不 说 丫头 们 太 小心 ， 还 只当 我 素日 是 这么 轻狂 惯 了 的 呢 。 ”,"Instead of saying how thoughtful the maid was , they would put it down to my arrogance and lack of breeding . '"
薛姨妈 道 ： “ 你 是 个 多心 的 ， 有 这些 想 头 。,"' You are altogether too sensitive , thinking of things like that , said Aunt Xue ."
我 就 没有 这些 心 。 ”,' Such a thought would never have crossed my mind ! '
说话 时 ， 宝玉 已 是 三杯 过去 了 。 李嬷嬷 又 上来 拦阻 。,Bao-yu had soon finished his third cup of wine and Nannie Li once more came forward to restrain him .
宝玉 正在 个心 甜意 洽 之 时 ， 又 兼 姐妹 们 说说笑笑 ， 那里 肯 不吃 ？,"But Bao-yu who was now warm and happy and in the midst of a hilarious conversation with his cousins , was naturally unwilling to stop , and pleaded humbly with the old lady for a reprieve ."
只得 屈意 央告 ： “ 好 妈妈 ， 我 再 吃 两杯 就 不吃 了 。 ”,"' Nannie darling , just two more cups and then I will stop ! '"
李嬷嬷 道 ： “ 你 可 仔细 今儿 老爷 在家 ， 提防 着 问 你 的 书 ！ ”,"' You would better look out , ' said Nannie Li. ' Your father 's at home today . He will be asking you about your lessons before you know where you are . '"
宝玉 听 了 此话 ， 便 心中 大 不悦 ， 慢慢 的 放下 酒 ， 垂 了 头 。,At these words all Bao-yu 's happiness drained away . Slowly he set down his cup and bowed his head in dejection .
黛玉忙 说道 ： “ 别 扫 大家 的 兴 ！,"' Do not spoil everyone 's enjoyment , ' said Dai-yu ."
舅舅 若 叫 ， 只 说 姨妈 这里 留住 你 。,"' Even if Uncle does call for you , you can always say that Aunt Xue is keeping you ."
— — 这 妈妈 ， 他 又 该 拿 我们 来醒 脾 了 ！ ”,I think that old Nannie of yours has had a cup too many and is looking for a bit of excitement at our expense . '
一面 悄悄的 推 宝玉 ， 叫 他 赌 赌气 ； 一面 咕哝 说 ： “ 别理 那 老货 ！ 咱们 只管 乐 咱们 的 ！ ”,"She gave him a gentle nudge to encourage a more valiant spirit in him , muttering , as she did so , ' Take no notice of the old fool ! Let is go on enjoying ourselves and not mind about her ! '"
那 李妈 也 素知 黛玉 的 为人 ， 说道 ： “ 林姐儿 ， 你 别 助 着 他 了 ！,"Nannie Li knew only too well what Dai-yu was capable of . ' Now Miss Lin , ' she said , ' do not you go taking his part !"
你 要 劝 他 ， 只怕 他 还 听 些 。 ”,If you encourage him he is only too likely to do what you say !
黛玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 为什么 助 着 他 ？,Dai-yu smiled dangerously . ' Take his part ?
— — 我 也 不犯 着 劝 他 。,Why should I want to encourage him ?
你 这 妈妈 太 小心 了 ！,"You are over-cautious , my dear Nannie ."
往常 老太太 又 给 他 酒 吃 ， 如今 在 姨妈 这里 多 吃 了 一口 ， 想来 也 不妨 事 。,"After all , Lady Jia often let's him drink ; why should it matter if Mrs Xue let's him have a cup or two ?"
必定 姨妈 这里 是 外人 ， 不当 在 这里 吃 ， 也 未可知 。 ”,I suppose you think he can not be trusted to drink here because Mrs Xue is not one of us ? '
李嬷嬷 听 了 ， 又 是 急 ， 又 是 笑 ， 说道 ： “ 真真 这 林姐儿 ， 说出 一句 话 来 ， 比 刀子 还 利害 。 ”,"Nannie Li did not know whether to feel upset or amused . ' Really , Miss Lin . Some of the things you say cut sharper than a knife ! '"
宝钗 也 忍不住 笑 着 把 黛玉 腮 上 一 拧 ， 说道 ： “ 真 真的 这个 颦 丫头 一 张嘴 ， 叫 人 恨 又 不是 ， 喜欢 又 不是 。 ”,"Bao-chai could not suppress a giggle . She pinched Dai-yu is cheek playfully . ' Really , Miss Frowner , the things you say ! One does not know whether to grind one 's teeth or laugh ! '"
薛姨妈 一面 笑 着 ， 又 说 ： “ 别怕 ， 别怕 ， 我 的 儿 ！,"Aunt Xue laughed too . ' Do not be afraid , my boy !"
来到 这里 ， 没 好 的 给 你 吃 ， 别 把 这 点子 东西 吓 的 存在 心里 ， 倒 叫 我 不安 。,"Heaven knows I have got little enough to offer you when you come to see me . You must not get upset over a small thing like this , or I shall feel quite uncomfortable ."
只管 放心 吃 ， 有 我 呢 ！,Drink as much as you like ; I will look after you !
索性 吃 了 晚饭 去 。,"You may as well stay to supper , in any case ;"
要 醉 了 ， 就 跟着 我 睡 罢 。 ”,"and even if you do get drunk , you can always spend the night here . '"
因命 ： “ 再 烫 些 酒 来 ， 一一 姨妈 陪 你 吃 两杯 ， 可 就 吃饭 罢 。 ”,"She told a maid to heat some more wine . ' There ! Auntie will drink a cup or two with you , and then we shall have some supper . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 方 又 鼓起 兴来 。,Bao-yu is spirits began to revive a bit under his aunt 's encouragement .
李嬷嬷 因 吩咐 小丫头 ： “ 你们 在 这里 小心 着 ， 我家 去 换 了 衣裳 就 来 。 ”,"' Keep an eye on him , ' said Nannie Li to the maids . ' I am just going back for a few minutes to change my clothes . '"
悄悄的 回 薛姨妈 道 ： “ 姨太太 别 由 他 尽 着 吃 了 。 ” 说 着 便家 去 了 。,"Then aside to Aunt Xue she said , ' Do not let him drink too much , Mrs Xue ! ' and went off home ."
这里 虽 还有 两三个 老婆子 ， 都 是 不关痛痒 的 ， 见 李妈 走 了 ， 也 都 悄悄的 自寻 方便 去 了 。 只 剩下 两个 小丫头 ， 乐得 讨 宝玉 的 喜欢 。,"Although two or three old women still remained after her departure , none felt very much concern for Bao-yu , and as soon as Nannie Li was out of the way they quietly slipped off about their own concerns , leaving , of the attendants who had come with him , only two small maids , whose only anxiety was to please their young master by indulging him as much as possible ."
幸而 薛姨妈 千哄万哄 ， 只 容 他 吃 了 几杯 ， 就忙 收过 了 。 作 了 酸 笋鸡 皮汤 ， 宝玉 痛 喝 了 几碗 ， 又 吃 了 半碗 多 碧 粳粥 ， 一时 薛林 二人 也 吃 完 了 饭 ， 又 酽 酽 的 喝 了 几碗 茶 。,"Fortunately Aunt Xue , by exercising great tact and finesse , managed to spirit the wine away when Bao-yu had drunk only a few more cups , and to replace it with a hot , sour soup of pickled bamboo-shoots and chicken-skin . He drank several bowls of this with great relish and then ate half a bowl of green-rice gruel . After that , when Bao-chai and Dai-yu had finished eating , he drank several cups of very strong tea ."
薛姨妈 才 放 了 心 。,At this point Aunt Xue felt sure that he would be all right .
雪雁 等 几个 人 ， 也 吃了饭 进来 伺候 。 黛玉 因 问宝玉 道 ： “ 你 走 不 走 ？ ”,"As Snowgoose and the other maids had now finished supper too and were once more in attendance , Dai-yu asked Bao-yu if he was ready to go ."
宝玉 乜斜 倦 眼道 ： “ 你 要 走 我 和 你 同 走 。 ”,"He looked at her blearily through tired eyes . ' If you want to go , I will go with you . '"
黛玉 听说 ， 遂 起身 道 ： “ 咱们 来 了 这 一日 ， 也 该 回去 了 。 ”,Dai-yu rose to her feet . ' We really ought to go . We have been here practically all day ! '
说 着 ， 二人 便 告辞 。,The two of them began saying their good-byes .
小丫头 忙 捧 过 斗笠 来 ， 宝玉 把头 略低 一 低 ， 叫 他 戴 上 ， 丫头 便 将 这 大红 猩毡 斗笠 一 抖 ， — — 才 往 宝玉 头上 一 合 ， 宝玉 便 说 ： “ 罢了 ， 罢了 ！,"A maid came forward with Bao-yu 's rain-hat and he lowered his head slightly for her to put it on . Holding the brim of the great saucer-shaped red felt top , she jerked it up and prepared to bring it down , aiming the inside part at his crown . ' Stop ! ' he cried impatiently ."
好 蠢 东西 ！ 你 也 轻 些 儿 ；,' You have got to go easy with a great clumsy thing like that !
难道 没 见 别人 戴 过 ？,Haven ' t you ever seen anyone putting one of these things on before ?
等 我 自己 戴 罢 。 ”,You had better let me do it myself '
黛玉 站 在 炕沿 上 道 ： “ 过来 ！,' Come here ! ' said Dai-yu standing on the edge of the kang .
我 给 你 戴 罢 。 ”,' I will put it on for youl
宝玉 忙 近 前来 。,Bao-yu went and stood in front of her .
黛玉 用 手 轻轻 笼住 束发冠 儿 ， 将笠 沿 掖 在 抹额 之上 ， 把 那 一颗 核桃 大 的 绛 绒 簪缨 扶 起 ， 颤巍巍 露 于笠 外 。,"Putting her two hands round the inner cap , Dai-yu eased it gently down until its rim fitted over his golden headband , so that the walnut-sized red woollen pompom of the headband was left quivering outside the cap on its flexible golden stem ."
整理 已 毕 ， 端详 了 一会 ， 说道 ： “ 好 了 ， 披上 斗篷 罢 。 ”,"' There ! ' she said , after a few further adjustments . ' Now you can put on your cape . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 方 接 了 斗篷 披上 。,Bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself .
薛姨妈 忙 道 ： “ 跟 你们 的 妈妈 都还没 来 呢 ， 且 略 等等 儿 。 ”,"' The nurses who came with you are still not back , ' said Aunt Xue . ' Perhaps you had better wait a bit . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我们 倒 等 着 他们 ！,' We wait for them ? ' said Bao-yu .
有 丫头 们 跟着 就是 了 。 ”,' We have got the maids . We shall be all right . '
薛姨妈 不 放心 ， 吩咐 两个 女人 送 了 他 兄妹 们 去 。,"But Aunt Xue was not satisfied , and ordered two of her own women to see the cousins home ."
他 二人 道 了扰 ， 一径 回至 贾母房 中 。 贾母 尚未 用 晚饭 ， 知是 薛姨妈 处来 ， 更加 喜欢 。 因见 宝玉 吃 了 酒 ， 遂 叫 他自 回 房中 歇 着 ， 不许 再 出来 了 。 又 令人 好生 招呼 着 。,"As soon as they were back they thanked the women for their trouble and went straight in to see Grandmother Jia , who had not yet had her supper . She was delighted to learn that they had been with Aunt Xue , and observing that Bao-yu , had had more than a little to drink , she told him to go and rest in his room and not come out again , and instructed the servants to keep a careful watch over him ."
忽 想起 跟 宝玉 的 人 来 ， 遂 问 众人 ： “ 李 奶子 怎么 不见 ？ ”,"Remembering which servants usually attended him , she asked what had become of Nannie Li."
众人 不敢 直说 他家 去 了 ， 只 说 ： “ 才 进来 了 ， 想 是 有事 ， 又 出去 了 。 ”,"The maids dared not tell her the truth , which was that she had gone home . ' I think she must have had something to do , ' said one of them . ' She came in when we did just now , but went out again almost immediately . '"
宝玉 踉跄 着 回头 道 ： “ 他 比 老太太 还 受用 呢 ！ 问 他 作 什么 ！ 没有 他 只怕 我 还 多 活 两日 儿 。 ” 一面 说 ， 一面 来 至 自己 卧室 。,"' Why worry about her ? ' said Bao-yu over his shoulder , swaying slightly as he made his way to the bedroom . ' She is better looked after than you are ! If it were not for her I might live a few days longer ! '"
只见 笔墨 在案 。,Inside his room he found a writing-brush and ink laid out on the desk .
晴雯 先 接 出来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 好 啊 ， 叫 我 研 了 墨 ， 早起 高兴 ， 只 写 了 三个 字 ， 扔下 笔 就 走 了 ， 哄 我 等 了 这 一天 。,"Skybright was the first to greet him . ' You are a nice one ! ' she said . ' You made me mix all this ink for you this morning , sat down in a state of great enthusiasm , wrote just three characters , threw down the brush again , rushed out , and left me waiting here all day for you to come back and finish ."
快来 给 我 写 完 了 这些 墨才 算 呢 ！ ”,"Now you just sit down here and use this ink up , and perhaps I will let the matter pass ! '"
宝玉 方 想起 早起 的 事 来 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 我 写 的 那 三个 字 在 那里 呢 ？ ”,Skybright 's words awoke in Bao-yu a recollection of the morning 's events . ' What became of the three characters I wrote ? '
晴雯 笑 道 ： “ 这个 人 可醉 了 。,"Skybright laughed . ' You are really drunk , are not you !"
你 头里 过 那 府 里 去 ， 嘱咐 我 贴 在 门斗 儿 上 的 ， 我 恐怕 别人 贴坏 了 ， 亲自 爬高 上梯 ， 贴 了 半天 ， 这 会子 还 冻 的 手 僵 着 呢 ！ ”,"This morning before you went to the other house you gave careful instructions that they were to be pasted up over the outside door . I was afraid that someone else might make a mess of it , so I got up on a ladder and spent half the morning sticking them up myself . My hands are still numb from doing it . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 忘 了 。,' I would forgotten . ' Bao-yu smiled .
你 手 冷 ， 我 替 你 握 着 。 ”,"' If your hands are cold , I will warm them for you . '"
便 伸手 拉 着 晴雯 的 手 ， 同 看门 斗 上 新写 的 三个 字 。,He took both her hands in his own and led her outside to inspect the sheet of calligraphy newly pasted up over the doorway .
一时 黛玉 来 了 ， 宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 你 别 撒谎 ， 你 看 这 三个 字 那 一个 好 ？ ”,"Just then Dai-yu arrived . ' I want you to tell me honestly , cousin , ' said Bao-yu . ' Which of these three characters do you think is the best ? '"
黛玉 仰头 看见 是 “ 绛 芸轩 ” 三 字 ， 笑 道 ： “ 个个 都 好 。,Dai-yu looked up at the three characters above the door : RED RUE STUDY ' They are all equally good .
怎么 写 的 这样 好 了 ！,I did not know you could write so beautifully .
明儿 也 替 我 写 个 匾 。 ”,You must do one for me some time ! '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 又 哄 我 了 。 ”,"' You are just saying that to humour me , ' said Bao-yu ."
说 着 又 问 ： “ 袭 人 姐姐 呢 ？ ”,' Where is Aroma ? ' he asked Skybright .
晴雯 向 里间 炕 上 努嘴儿 。 宝玉 看 时 ， 见 袭 人 和 衣 睡着 。,"Skybright shot out her lips and indicated the kang inside , on which Aroma , fully clothed , was lying fast asleep ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 好 啊 ！,' Just look at that ! ' said Bao-yu with a laugh .
这么 早就 睡 了 。 ”,"It is a bit early for sleep , is not it ? '"
又 问 晴雯 道 ： “ 今儿 我 那边 吃 早饭 ， 有 一 碟子 豆腐皮 儿 的 包子 。,He turned once more to Skybright . ' When I was having lunch at the other house today there was a plate of bean-curd dumplings .
我 想着 你 爱 吃 ， 和 珍大 奶奶 要 了 ， 只说 我 晚上 吃 ， 叫 人 送来 的 。,I remembered how fond you are of those things and asked Mrs Zhen if I could have some to eat in the evening . She had them sent over for me .
你 可见 了 没有 ？ ”,Did you get them all right ? '
晴雯 道 ： “ 快 别提 了 。,' Do not talk to me about those dumplings ! ' said Skybright .
一 送来 我 就 知道 是 我 的 。 偏 才 吃了饭 ， 就 搁 在 那里 。,"' As soon as they arrived I realized that they must be for me , but as I would only just finished eating , I put them on one side meaning to eat them later ."
后来 李 奶奶 来 了 看见 ， 说 ： ‘ 宝玉 未必 吃 了 ， 拿 去 给 我 孙子 吃 罢 。 ’ 就 叫 人 送 了 家 去 了 。 ”,"Then after a while Nannie Li came in and caught sight of them . "" I do not expect Bao-yu will want these , "" she said . "" I think I will take them for my grandchildren "" ; and she had them sent round to her house . '"
正说 着 ， 茜 雪 捧 上 茶 来 ， 宝玉 还 让 ： “ 林妹妹 喝茶 。 ” 众人 笑 道 ： “ 林姑娘 早 走 了 ， 还 让 呢 ！ ”,"While Skybright was talking , Snowpink came in carrying some tea on a tray . Bao-yu invited Dai-yu to have some , to the great merriment of the maids , who pointed out that she had slipped away some minutes before ."
宝玉 吃 了 半盏 ， 忽 又 想起 早晨 的 茶 来 ， 问茜雪 道 ： “ 早起 沏 了 碗 枫露 茶 ， 我 说 过 那 茶 是 三四次 后才 出色 ， 这 会子 怎么 又 斟上 这个 茶 来 ？ ”,"After drinking about half a cupful , Bao-yu suddenly thought of the tea he had drunk early that morning . ' When you made that Fung Loo this morning , ' he said to Snowpink , ' I remember telling you that with that particular brand the full flavour does not come out until after three or four waterings . Why have you given me this other stuff ? This would have been just the time to have the Fung Loo . '"
茜 雪 道 ： “ 我 原 留 着 来 着 ， 那会子 李 奶奶 来 了 ， 喝 了 去 了 。 ”,"' I was keeping it for you , ' said Snowpink , ' but Nannie Li came and drank it all ."
宝玉 听 了 ， 将 手中 茶杯 顺手 往 地下 一 摔 ， 豁琅 一声 ， 打了个 粉碎 ， 泼 了 茜 雪 一 裙子 。,"With a flick of the wrist Bao-yu hurled the cup he was holding on to the floor , where it smashed noisily , breaking into innumerable pieces and showering Snowpink 's skirt with hot tea ."
又 跳 起来 问 着 茜 雪 道 ： “ 他 是 你 那 一门 子 的 ‘ 奶奶 ’ ， 你们 这么 孝敬 他 ？,He jumped angrily to his feet . ' Is she your mistress that you should all treat her with such reverence ?
不过 是 我 小时候 儿 吃 过 他 几日 奶 罢了 ， 如今 惯 的 比 祖宗 还 大 ， 撵出去 大家 干净 ！ ”,Merely because I drank her milk for a few days when I was a baby she is as spoiled and pampered as though she were some sort of divinity . Let is get rid of the old woman now and have done with it !
说 着 立刻 便 要 去 回 贾母 。,And he strode off without more ado to tell Grandmother Jia that he wanted his old nurse dismissed .
原来 袭 人 未 睡 ， 不过 是 故意 儿 装睡 ， 引着 宝玉 来 怄 他 玩耍 ；,"All this time Aroma had been only pretending to sleep , hoping by this means to engage Bao-yu 's attention and provoke some coquetry between them ."
先 听见 说 字 问 包子 ， 也 还 可以 不必 起来 ； 后来 摔 了 茶 钟 ， 动 了 气 ， 遂 连忙 起来 解劝 。,As long as the talk dwelt on calligraphy and Skybright 's dumplings there seemed no pressing need for her to get up ; but when she heard him break a teacup and grow really angry she hurriedly rose to her feet and intervened to restrain him .
早 有 贾母 那边 的 人 来 问 ： “ 是 怎么 了 ？ ”,By this time someone had arrived from Grandmother Jia is room to inquire what all the noise was about .
袭 人 忙 道 ： “ 我 才 倒 茶 ， 叫 雪 滑倒 了 ， 失手 砸 了 钟子 了 。 ”,Aroma pretended that she had smashed the cup herself by slipping on some snow while fetching tea .
一面 又 劝 宝玉 道 ： “ 你 诚心 要 撵 他 也好 ， 我们 都 愿意 出去 ， 不如 就势 儿 连 我们 一齐 撵 了 ， 你 也 不愁 没有 好 的 来 伏侍 你 。 ”,"Having disposed of the inquirer , she then proceeded to exhort Bao-yu . ' Dismiss her by all means , if you really want to ! But we should all like to leave with her ; so while you are about it , why not make a clean sweep and dismiss the lot of us ? I am sure you will find plenty of other good servants to replace us with . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 方才 不 言语 了 。 袭 人 等 便 搀 至 炕上 ， 脱 了 衣裳 ， 不知 宝玉 口内 还 说 些 什么 ， 只 觉 口齿 缠绵 ， 眉眼 愈加 饧 涩 ， 忙 伏侍 他 睡 下 。,"Bao-yu had nothing to say to this , and Aroma and the rest helped him onto the kang and started undressing him . He kept trying to tell them something as they did so , but an object seemed to impede his tongue and his eyelids were growing increasingly hot and heavy . Soon the maids had him lying down between covers ."
袭 人 摘下 那 “ 通灵宝玉 ” 来 ， 用 绢子 包 好 ， 塞 在 褥子 底下 ， 恐怕 次日 带 时 冰 了 他 的 脖子 。,"Aroma took off the ' Magic Jade ' , wrapped it in a piece of silk , and slipped it under the quilt , so that it should not be cold on his neck the next morning ."
那宝玉 到 枕 就 睡着 了 。,"By this time Bao-yu was already asleep , having dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow ."
彼时 李嬷嬷 等 已 进来 了 ， 听见 醉 了 ， 也 就 不敢 上前 ， 只 悄悄的 打听 睡着 了 ， 方 放心 散 去 。,"While this was going on , Nannie Li and the other old women had arrived back at last . Learning that Bao-yu was drunk , they dared not approach him and soon went off again , having satisfied themselves by whispered exchanges that he was safely asleep ."
次日 醒来 ， 就 有人 回 ： “ 那边 小蓉 大爷 带 了 秦钟来 拜 。 ”,Bao-yu awoke next morning to hear someone announcing that ' Master Rong from the other house ' had brought Qin Zhong over to pay his respects .
宝玉 忙 接 出去 ， 领 了 拜见 贾母 。,Bao-yu hurried out to receive them and conducted Qin Zhong into the presence of Grandmother Jia .
贾母 见 秦钟 形容 标致 ， 举止 温柔 ， 堪 陪 宝玉 读书 ， 心中 十分 喜欢 ， 便 留茶 留饭 ， 又 叫 人 带 去 见 王夫人 等 。,"Observing that Qin Zhong 's good looks and gentle demeanour admirably qualified him to become Bao-yu 's study-companion , Grandmother Jia was pleased , and made him stay for tea and then dinner , after which she sent him to be introduced to Lady Wang and the rest ."
众人 因 爱 秦氏 ， 见 了 秦钟 是 这样 人品 ， 也 都 欢喜 ， 临去 时 ， 都 有 表礼 。,"Everybody loved Qin-shi and was delighted to meet this charming younger brother , and there were First Meeting presents from everybody waiting for him when he left ."
贾母 又 给 了 一个 荷包 和 一个 金 魁星 ， 取 “ 文星 和 合 ” 之 意 。,Grandmother Jia is was an embroidered purse enclosing a little God of Literature in solid gold to signify that literary success was ' in the bag ' .
又 嘱咐 他 道 ： “ 你 家住 的 远 ， 或 一时 冷热 不便 ， 只管 住 在 我们 这里 。,"' Since your home is so far away , ' she said to Qin Zhong as he was leaving , ' the weather may sometimes make it inconvenient for you to go back at night . In that case , do please stay here with us !"
只 和 你 宝二叔 在 一处 ， 别 跟着 那 不长进 的 东西 们 学 。 ”,And mind that you always keep with your Uncle Bao and do not go getting into mischief with those young ragamuffins at the school ! '
秦钟一一 的 答应 ， 回家 禀知 他 父亲 。,Qin Zhong received these admonitions with deference and then went home to report on the day 's events to his father .
他 父亲 秦邦业 现任 营缮 司 郎中 ， 年 近 七旬 ， 夫人 早 亡 ， 因 年 至 五旬 时 尚无 儿女 ， 便 向 养生堂 抱 了 一个 儿子 和 一个 女儿 。,"Qin Zhong 's father , Qin Bang-ye , was one of the Secretaries in the Public Buildings Department of the Board of Works and a man in his middle sixties . He had lost his wife early , and finding himself still childless at the age of fifty , had adopted a boy and a girl from an orphanage ."
谁知 儿子 又 死 了 ， 只 剩下 个 女儿 ， 小名 叫做 可 儿 ， 又 起 个 官名 叫做 ｛ 可 卿 ｝ 。 长大 时 ， 生 得 形容 袅娜 ， 性格 风流 ， 因素 与 贾家 有些 瓜葛 ， 故 结 了 亲 。,"The boy had died , leaving only the girl Ke-er , or ' Ke-qing ' as she was more elegantly renamed , who had grown up into an extremely charming and vivacious young woman and been married into the Jia family , with whom her adoptive father had long had a connection ."
秦邦业 却 于 五十三岁 上得 了 秦钟 ， 今年 十二岁 了 ；,Qin Bang-ye fathered Qin Zhong when he was fifty-three and the boy was now twelve years old .
因 去岁 业师 回南 ， 在家 温习 旧 课 ， 正要 与 贾 亲家 商议 附往 他 家塾 中 去 ， 可巧 遇见 宝玉 这个 机会 ， 又 知 贾 家塾 中司塾 的 乃 现今 之老 儒 贾代儒 ， 秦钟 此去 ， 可望 学业 进益 ， 从此 成名 ， 因 十分 喜悦 。,"His tutor had returned south the year before , and he had been revising old lessons at home ever since . Qin Bang-ye had himself been on the point of speaking to his daughter 's in-laws about the possibility of getting Qin Zhong admitted into the Jia clan school as an external scholar when the happy accident of Qin Zhong 's meeting with Baoyu occurred . Bang-ye knew of Jia Dai-ru , the master in charge of the school , as one of the leading elder scholars of the day , under whose tutelage there would be every hope of Qin Zhong 's making rapid strides in his education and eventually obtaining an advancement . He was therefore delighted that the matter had been so easily concluded ."
只是 宦囊 羞涩 ， 那边 都 是 一双 富贵 眼睛 ， 少 了 拿 不 出来 ；,"There was only one difficulty . Knowing the sort of style in which the Jias lived , Bang-ye realized that he would have to dip deeply into his pocket , and his official salary left that pocket only meagrely supplied ."
因是 儿子 的 终身大事 所关 ， 说不得 东并西 凑 ， 恭恭敬敬 封 了 二十四两 贽 见 礼 ， 带 了 秦钟 到 代 儒家 来 拜见 ， 然后 听宝玉 拣 的 好日子 ， 一同 入塾 。,"However , since this was a matter which concerned the whole future of his son , there was nothing for it but to strain his credit to the utmost . By borrowing a bit here and a bit there he was able to get together a sum of twenty-four taels of silver which he made up into a packet and laid reverently before Jia Dai-ru when he took Qin Zhong to the old teacher 's house to make his kotow . Nothing now remained but for Bao-yu to choose an auspicious day on which the two of them could begin school together ."
塾中 从此 闹 起事 来 。 未知 如何 ， 下回分解 。,Their entry into the school was the occasion of a tumultuous incident of which an account will be given in the following chapter .
第九回,Chapter 9
训 劣子 李贵承 申饬,A son is admonished and Li Gui recelves an alarming warning
嗔 顽童 茗 烟 闹 书房,A pupil is abused and Tealeaf throws the classroom in an uproar
话 说 秦邦业 父子 专候 贾 家人 来 送 上学 之 信 。,In the last chapter we left Qin Bang-ye and his son waiting for a message from the Jia household to tell them when Qin Zhong was to begin school .
原来 宝玉 急于 要 和 秦钟 相遇 ， 遂择 了 后日 一定 上学 ， 打发 人 送 了 信 。,Bao-yu was impatient to see Qin Zhong again and sent word to say that it was to be the day after next .
到 了 这天 ， 宝玉 起来 时 ， 袭 人 早已 把 书笔 文物 收拾 停妥 ， 坐在 床沿 上 发闷 ， 见 宝玉 起来 ， 只得 伏侍 他 梳洗 。,"When the appointed day arrived , Bao-yu rose in the morning to find that Aroma had already got his books , brushes and other writing materials ready for him and was sitting disconsolately on the side of his bed . Seeing him get up , she roused herself and helped him to do his hair and wash ."
宝玉 见 他 闷闷 的 ， 问道 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 你 怎么 又 不 喜欢 了 ？,"He asked her the cause of her despondency . ' What is upset you this time , Aroma ?"
难道 怕 我 上学 去 ， 撂 的 你们 冷清 了 不成 ？ ”,I can not believe you are worried about being left alone while I am at school . '
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 这 是 那里 的话 ？,' Of course not ! ' said Aroma with a laugh .
念书 是 很好 的 事 ， 不然 就 潦倒 一辈子 了 ， 终久 怎么样 呢 ？,' Learning is a very good thing . Without it you would fritter all your life away and never get anywhere .
但 只 一件 ： 只是 念书 的 时候 儿 想着 书 ， 不念 的 时候 儿 想着 家 。 总别 和 他们 玩闹 ， 碰见 老爷 不是 玩 的 。,"I only hope that you will see to it that you are learning when you are meant to be and that , when you are not , you will be thinking about home and not getting into scrapes with the other boys ; because then you would be in real trouble with your father ."
虽说 是 奋志 要强 ， 那 工课 宁可 少 些 ：,"And though you talk a lot about the need for effort and self-improvement , it would really be better to do too little work than too much ."
一则 贪多嚼不烂 ， 二则 身子 也 要 保重 。,For one thing you do not want to bite off more than you can chew ; and for another you do not want your health to suffer .
这 就是 我 的 意思 ， 你 好歹 体谅 些 。 ”,"At least , that is how it seems to me , so you must not mind my saying so . '"
袭 人 说 一句 ， 宝玉 答应 一句 。,"Each time Aroma paused , Bao-yu answered ' Yes ' or ' No ' ."
袭 人 又 道 ： “ 大 毛儿 衣服 我 也 包好 了 ， 交给 小子 们 去 了 。,She continued : ' I have packed your big fur gown for the pages to take .
学里 冷 ， 好歹 想着 添换 ， 比 不得 家里 有人 照顾 。,"Mind you put it on if you find it cold at the school . It will not be like here , where there is always someone else to think of these things for you ."
脚炉 手炉 也 交出去 了 ， 你 可 逼 着 他们 给 你 笼 上 。,I have also given them your foot-warmer and your hand-warmer . You will have to see that they give the charcoal a stir from time to time .
那 一起 懒 贼 ， 你 不 说 ， 他们 乐得 不 动 ， 白 冻坏 了 你 。 ”,"They are such a lazy pack of good-for-nothings , they will be only too pleased to do nothing if you do not stand over them . You could freeze to death for all they cared . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 放心 ， 我 自己 都 会 调停 的 。,' Do not worry ! ' said Bao-yu . ' I know how to do it myself .
你们 也 可别 闷死 在 这 屋里 ， 长 和 林妹妹 一处 玩玩儿 去才 好 。 ”,"And do not go getting gloomy , all of you , cooped up here while I am away . Try to spend as much time as you can with my Cousin Lin . '"
说 着 俱 已 穿戴 齐备 ， 袭 人 催 他 去 见 贾母 、 贾政 、 王夫人 。,"His dressing was now completed and Aroma urged him to begin his visits to Grandmother Jia , Jia Zheng and Lady Wang ."
宝玉 又 嘱咐 了 晴雯 麝月 几句 ， 方 出来 见 贾母 。 贾母 也 不免 有 几句 嘱咐 的话 。 然后 去 见 王夫人 ， 又 出来 到 书房 中 见 贾政 。,"After a few parting instructions to Skybright and Musk , he went of to his grandmother 's , where he had to listen to more admonitions , then on to Lady Wang 's , and then outside to the study to see his father , Jia Zheng ."
这日 贾政正 在 书房 中 和 清客 相公 们 说闲话 儿 ， 忽 见 宝玉 进来 请安 ， 回说 上学 去 ， 贾政 冷笑 道 ： “ 你 要 再 提 ‘ 上学 ’ 两个 字 ， 连 我 也 羞死 了 。,"Jia Zheng was in conversation with his literary gentlemen when Bao-yu entered the room and made his salutation . Hearing him announce that he was off to school to resume his studies , Jia Zheng smiled sarcastically . ' I think you had better not use that word "" studies "" again in my hearing , unless you want to make me blush for you ."
依 我 的话 ， 你 竟 玩 你 的 去 是 正经 。,"In my opinion you might just as well be left to fool around as before , since that is all you seem fit for ."
看 仔细 站 腌臜 了 我 这个 地 ， 靠 腌臜 了 我 这个 门 ！ ”,"At all events , I do not want you here . I find your presence in a place like this contaminating . '"
众 清客 都 起身 笑 道 ： “ 老世翁 何必如此 。,"The literary gentlemen rose to their feet with nervous laughter . ' Come , come , Sir Zheng ! You are too hard on him !"
今日 世兄 一 去 ， 二三年 就 可 显身 成名 的 ， 断 不似 往年 仍 作 小儿 之 态 了 。,"Two or three years from now our young friend will be carrying all before him ! He has left his old , childish ways behind him now - haven ' t you boy ? Quite reformed . Come ! '"
— — 天 也 将 饭时 了 ， 世兄 竟快 请 罢 。 ” 说 着 便 有 两个 年老 的 携 了 宝玉 出去 。,- two of the older men took Bao-yu by the hands and hurried him from the room - ' I am sure it must be time now for your breakfast . To breakfast ! To breakfast ! '
贾政因 问 ： “ 跟 宝玉 的 是 谁 ？ ”,Jia Zheng asked who was in attendance on Bao-yu .
只 听见 外面 答应 了 一声 ， 早 进来 三四个 大汉 ， 打千 儿 请安 。,"There was a ringing ' Sir ! ' from outside , and three or four strapping fellows entered the study and saluted Manchu fashion ."
贾政 看 时 ， 是 宝玉 奶姆 的 儿子 ， 名唤 李贵 的 ；,"Jia Zheng recognized the foremost one as Li Gui , the son of Bao-yu 's old wet-nurse , Nannie Li , and addressed himself to him ."
因 向 他 道 ： “ 你们 成 日 家 跟 他 上学 ， 他 到底 念 了 些 什么 书 ！,' You have attended Bao-yu during all his lessons in the past . What precisely has he been doing ?
倒念 了 些 流言混话 在 肚子 里 ， 学 了 些 精致 的 淘气 。,"Stuffing his head with worthless nonsense and acquiring a fine new stock of knavish tricks , I should not wonder !"
等 我 闲一闲 ， 先 揭 了 你 的 皮 ， 再 和 那 不长进 的 东西 算账 ！ ”,Wait until I have a little time to spare : I will have your hide off first and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing son of mine ! '
吓 的 李贵忙 双 膝 跪下 ， 摘 了 帽子 碰头 ， 连连 答应 “ 是 ” ， 又 回 说 ： “ 哥儿 已经 念 到 第三本 《 诗经 》 ， 什么 ‘ 攸攸鹿 鸣 ， 荷叶 浮萍 ’ ， 小 的 不敢 撒谎 。 ”,"' Sir ! ' Li Gui sank terrified to his knees , snatched oft his cap , and knocked the ground several times with his forehead . ' Master Bao has read the first three books of the Poetry Classic , sir , up to the part that goes Hear the happy bleeding deer Grousing in the vagrant meads ... That is the truth , sir . I would not tell a lie ."
说 的 满 坐 哄然大笑 起来 ， 贾政 也 掌 不住 笑 了 。,This novel version of the well-known lines provoked a roar of laughter from the literary gentlemen . Even Jia Zheng could not restrain a smile .
因 说道 ： “ 那 怕 再 念 三十本 《 诗经 》 ， 也 是 ‘ 掩耳盗铃 ’ ， 哄人 而已 。,"' If he read thirty books of the Poetry Classic , ' said Jia Zheng , ' it would still be tomfoolery . No doubt he hopes to deceive others with this sort of thing , but he does not deceive me ."
你 去 请 学里 太爷 的 安 ， 就 说 我 说 的 ： 什么 《 诗经 》 、 古文 ， 一概 不用 虚应故事 ， 只是 先 把 《 四书 》 一齐 讲明 背熟 ， 是 最 要紧 的 。 ”,Give my compliments to the Headmaster and tell him from me that I want none of this trifling with the Poetry Classic or any other ancient literature . It is of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly understand and learn by heart the whole Four Books before he attempts anything else . '
李贵忙 答应 “ 是 ” ， 见 贾政 无话 ， 方 起来 退出 去 。,"' Sir ! ' Seeing that Jia Zheng had nothing more to say , Li Gui and the other servants rose to their feet again and withdrew ."
此时 宝玉 独站 在 院外 ， 屏声 静候 ， 等 他们 出来 同 走 。,"All this time Bao-yu had been waiting for them in the courtyard outside , scarcely daring to breathe ."
李贵 等 一面 撞 衣裳 ， 一面 说道 ： “ 哥儿 可 听见 了 ？,"As they came out , dusting their knees , Li Gui said , ' Did you hear that , young master ?"
先要 揭 我们 的 皮 呢 ！,""" Have my hide off first "" he said ."
人家 的 奴才 跟 主子 赚 些 个 体面 ， 我们 这些 奴才 白 陪 着 挨打受骂 的 。,"Some people 's servants are respected for their masters ' sakes , but not us . All we get is beatings and hard words ."
从此 也 可怜见 些 才 好 ！ ”,"So spare a thought for us in future , will you ? '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 好 哥哥 ， 你 别 委屈 ， 我 明儿 请 你 。 ”,"' Do not be upset , old chap ! ' said Bao-yu . ' Tomorrow I will treat you all . '"
李贵道 ： “ 小 祖宗 ， 谁 敢 望 ‘ 请 ’ ， 只求 听 一两句话 就 有 了 。 ”,"' Little ancestor , ' Li Gui replied , ' nobody 's looking for treats . All we ask is that once in a while - just once in a while - you should do what you are told . '"
说 着 又 至 贾母 这边 ， 秦钟 早已 来 了 ， 贾母正 和 他 说话 儿 呢 。,They were now back at Grandmother Jia is apartment . Qin Zhong had already arrived and was engaged in conversation with the old lady .
于是 二人 见 过 ， 辞 了 贾母 。,As soon as the two friends had greeted each other they took their leave .
宝玉 忽 想起 未 辞 黛玉 ， 又 忙 至 黛玉 房中 来 作辞 。,Bao-yu suddenly remembered that he had not yet seen Dai-yu and hurried to her room to say good-bye .
彼时 黛玉 在 窗下 对 镜理妆 ， 听宝玉 说 上学 去 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 好 ！,He found her by the window making herself up at the mirror . Her answer to his announcement that he was off to begin school was smiling but perfunctory :
这一 去 ， 可是 要 ‘ 蟾宫折桂 ’ 了 ！,' Good . I wish you every success .
我 不能 送 你 了 。 ”,I am sorry I can not see you off . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 等 我 下学 再 吃晚饭 。 那 胭脂 膏子 也 等 我 来 再 制 。 ”,"' Wait till I get back and have had my supper , cousin , ' said Bao-yu , ' and I will give you a hand with that rouge . '"
唠叨 了 半日 ， 方 抽身 去 了 。,He chatted with her for quite a bit longer before finally tearing himself away .
黛玉忙 又 叫住 问道 ： “ 你 怎么 不 去 辞 你 宝姐姐 来 呢 ？ ”,As he was going she suddenly called after him so that he stopped : ' Are not you going to say good-bye to your cousin Bao-chai ? '
宝玉 笑而不答 ， 一 径 同 秦钟 上学 去 了 。,Bao-yu smiled but said nothing and went straight of to school with Qin Zhong .
原来 这 义学 也 离家 不远 ， 原系 当日 始祖 所 立 ， 恐族 中 子弟 有力 不能 延 师者 ， 即入 此中 读书 ；,The Jia clan school was situated at no great distance from Rong-guo House . It was a charitable foundation which had been established many years previously by the founder of the family and was designed for the sons and younger brothers of those members of the clan who could not afford to pay for private tuition .
凡族 中 为官者 ， 皆 有 帮助 银两 ， 以为 学 中 膏火之费 ， 举 年 高有德 之 人为 塾师 。,All members of the clan holding official posts were expected to contribute towards its expenses and members of advanced years and known integrity were chosen to be its masters .
如今 秦宝 二人 来 了 ， 一一 的 都 互相 拜见 过 ， 读起 书 来 。,As soon as Bao-yu and Qin Zhong arrived they were introduced to the other students and then set to work at once on their lessons .
自 此后 ， 二人 同来同往 ， 同 起同 坐 ， 愈加 亲密 。,"From now on the two friends were inseparable , arriving at school and leaving school together and sitting beside each other in class ."
兼 贾母 爱惜 ， 也常 留下 秦钟 ， 一 住 三五天 ， 和 自己 重孙 一般 看待 。,Grandmother Jia herself became very fond of Qin Zhong . She was always having him to stay for three or four nights at a time and treated him exactly as if he were one of her own great-grandchildren .
因见 秦钟 家中 不 甚 宽裕 ， 又 助 些 衣服 等物 。,"And because she realized that his family was not very well off , she frequently helped out with clothes and the like ."
不上 一两月 工夫 ， 秦钟 在 荣府 里 便 惯 熟 了 。,Within a month or two he was a familiar and accepted member of the Rong household .
宝玉 终是 个 不能 安分 守理 的 人 ， 一味 的 随心所欲 ， 因此 发 了 癖性 ， 又 向 秦钟悄 说 ： “ 咱们 两个 人 ， 一样 的 年纪 ， 况 又 同窗 ， 以后 不必 论 叔侄 ， 只论 弟兄 朋友 就是 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu had always been impatient of social conventions , preferring to let sentiment rather than convention dictate the terms of his relationships . It was this which now prompted him to make Qin Zhong the following proposal : ' You and I are schoolmates and pretty much the same age . Let us in future forget all this "" uncle "" "" nephew "" business and address each other exactly like friends or brothers ! '"
先是 秦钟 不敢 ， 宝玉 不 从 ， 只 叫 他 “ 兄弟 ” ， 叫 他 表字 “ 鲸 卿 ” ； 秦钟 也 只得 混 着 乱叫 起来 。,"Qin Zhong was at first too timid to comply ; but as Bao-yu persisted and went on calling him ' brother ' or ' Jing-qing ' ( which was his school-name ) whenever he spoke to him , Qin Zhong himself gradually fell into the habit of addressing Bao-yu as an equal ."
原来 这 学 中 虽 都 是 本族 子弟 与 些 亲戚家 的 子侄 ， 俗语说 的 好 ， “ 一龙九种 ， 种种 各别 ” ， 未免 人 多 了 就 有 龙蛇混杂 ， 下流 人物 在内 。,"All the pupils at the clan school were either members of the Jia clan or relations by marriage ; but as the proverb rightly says , ' there are nine kinds of dragon and no two kinds are alike ' . Where many are gathered together the wheat is sure to contain a certain amount of chaff ; and this school was no exception in numbering some very ill-bred persons among its pupils ."
自 秦宝 二人 来 了 ， 都 生 的 花朵儿 一般 的 模样 ， 又 见 秦钟 腼腆 温柔 ， 未语 先 红 ， 怯怯 羞羞 ， 有 女儿 之 风 ；,"The two new boys , Qin Zhong and Bao-yu , were both as beautiful as flowers ; the other scholars observed how shrinking and gentle Qin Zhong was , blushing almost before you spoke to him and timid and bashful as a girl ;"
宝玉 又 是 天 生成 惯能 作小服低 ， 赔身下气 ， 性情 体贴 ， 话语 缠绵 ；,"they saw in Bao-yu one whom nature and habit had made humble and accommodating in spite of his social position , always willing to defer to others in the interest of harmony ;"
因 他 二人 又 这般 亲厚 ， 也 怨不得 那 起 同窗 人 起 了 嫌疑 之 念 ：,they observed his affectionate disposition and familiar manner of speech ; and they could see that the two friends were devoted to each other .
背地里 你 言 我 语 ， 诟谇 谣诼 ， 布满 书房 内外 。,"Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that these observations should have given rise to certain suspicions in the minds of those ill-bred persons , and that both in school and out of it all kinds of ugly rumours should have circulated behind their backs ."
原来 薛蟠自 来 王夫人 处住 后 ， 便 知有 一家 学 ， 学 中 广有 青年 子弟 ， 偶动 了 “ 龙阳 ” 之兴 ， 因此 也 假说 来 上学 ， 不过 是 “ 三日 打鱼 ， 两 日晒 网 ” ， 白送 些 束脩 礼物 与 贾代儒 ， 却不曾 有 一点儿 进益 ， 只 图 结交 些 契弟 。,"When Xue Pan learned , some time after moving into his aunt 's place in the capital , that the establishment included a clan school plentifully stocked with young males of a certain age , his old enthusiasm for ' Lord Long-yang 's vice ' was reawakened , and he had hastened to register himself as a pupil . His school-going was , needless to say , a pretence - ' one day fishing and two days to dry the nets ' as they say - and had nothing to do with the advancement of learning . Having paid a generous fee to Jia Dai-ru , he used his membership of the school merely as a means of picking up ' soul-mates ' from among his fellow-students ."
谁 想 这 学 内 的 小学生 ， 图 了 薛蟠 的 银钱 穿 吃 ， 被 他 哄 上手 了 ， 也 不消 多记 。,It must with regret be recorded that a surprisingly large number of the latter were deluded into becoming his willing victims by the prospect of receiving those ample advances of money and goods which he was in a position to offer .
又 有 两个 多情 的 小学生 ， 亦 不知 是 那一 房 的 亲眷 ， 亦 未考 真 姓名 ， 只 因 生得 娬 媚 风流 ， 满学 中 都 送 了 两个 外号 ， 一个 叫 “ 香怜 ” ， 一个 叫 “ 玉爱 ” 。,"Among them were two amorous young creatures whose names and parentage escape us but who , because of their glamorous looks and affected manners , were universally known by the nicknames of ' Darling ' and ' Precious ' ."
别人 虽 都 有 羡慕 之 意 、 “ 不利于 孺子 ” 之 心 ， 只是 惧怕 薛蟠 的 威势 ， 不敢 来 沾惹 。,"Although their fellow-students much admired them and entertained towards them feelings not at all conducive to that health of mind which the Young Person should at all times endeavour to cultivate , they were deterred from meddling with them for fear of what Xue Pan might do ."
如今 秦宝 二人 一来 了 ， 见 了 他 两个 ， 也 不免 缱绻 羡爱 ， 亦 知系 薛蟠 相知 ， 未敢 轻举妄动 ；,When Qin Zhong and Bao-yu joined the school it was only to be expected that they too should fall under the spell of this charming pair ; but like the rest they were inhibited from overt declaration of their feelings by the knowledge that Xue Pan was their ' friend ' .
香玉 二人 心中 ， 一般 的 留情 与 秦宝 ： 因此 四 人 心中 虽 有 情意 ， 只未 发出 。 每日 一 入学 中 ， 四处 各 坐 ， 却 八目 勾留 ， 或 设言托意 ， 或 咏桑寓柳 ， 遥以 心照 ， 却 外面 自 为 避人眼目 。,"Their feelings were reciprocated by Darling and Precious , and a bond of mutual attraction grew up between the four , which nevertheless remained unexpressed , except for the significant looks that every day passed between them across the classroom , or the occasional rather too loud utterance to a neighbour of some remark really intended for the ears of the opposite pair . They were persuaded that these cryptic communications had escaped the notice of their fellows ; but they were wrong ."
不料 偏 又 有 几个 滑贼 看出 形景 来 ， 都 背后 挤眉弄眼 ， 或 咳嗽 扬声 。,"Certain young hooligans among their classmates had long since discerned the true nature of what was going on , and while the two handsome couples were engaged in their silent and ( as they thought ) secret communion , these others would be winking and leering behind their backs or becoming suddenly convulsed with paroxysms of artificial coughing ."
— — 这 也 非 止 一日 。,
可巧 这 日代 儒 有事 回家 ， 只 留下 一句 七言 对联 ， 令 学生 对 了 明日 再 来 上书 ； 将学 中 之 事 ， 又 命 长孙 贾瑞 管理 。,"It happened that one day Jia Dai-ru was called home on business and left the class with the first half of a fourteen word couplet to complete , telling them that he would be back on the morrow to take them over the next passage in their reading and putting his eldest grandson Jia Rui in charge of the school during his absence ."
妙 在 薛蟠 如今 不 大 上学 应卯 了 ， 因此 秦钟趁 此 和 香怜 弄眉挤眼 ， 二人 假出 小恭 ， 走 至 后院 说话 。,"Xue Pan had by now stopped coming in even for roll-call , and so on this occasion he too was out of the way . The opportunity was too good to miss , and Qin Zhong and Darling , after a preliminary exchange of glances , both asked to be excused and went round to the rear courtyard to converse ."
秦钟先 问 他 ： “ 家里 的 大人 可管 你 交朋友 不管 — — ”,' Does your father mind what friends you have ? ' Qin Zhong had got no further than this question when there was a cough behind them .
一 语 未了 ， 只 听见 背后 咳嗽 了 一声 ， 二人 吓 的 忙 回顾 时 ， 原来 是 窗友 名 金荣 的 。,The two boys spun round and saw that it came from their classmate ' Jokey ' Jin .
香怜本 有些 性急 ， 便 羞怒 相激 ， 问 他 道 ： “ 你 咳嗽 什么 ？,"Darling had a somewhat impetuous nature which now , fired by a mixture of anger and shame , caused him to round sharply on the intruder . ' What ' ' s that cough supposed to mean ?"
难道 不许 我们 说话 不成 ？ ”,Are not we allowed to talk if we want to ? '
金荣笑 道 ： “ 许 你们 说话 ， 难道 不许 我 咳嗽 不成 ？,"Jokey Jin leered : ' If you are allowed to talk , are not I allowed to cough if I want to ?"
我 只 问 你们 ： 有话 不 分明 说 ， 许 你们 这样 鬼鬼祟祟 的 干什么 故事 ？,"What I would like to know is , if you have got something to say to each other , why can not you say it out openly ? Why all this guilty secrecy ? But what is the good of pretending ?"
我 可 也 拿 住 了 ！ 还赖 什么 ？,It is a fair cop .
先 让 我 抽 个头儿 ， 咱们 一声 儿 不 言语 ；,You let me in on your game and I will not say anything .
不然 大家 就 翻 起来 ！ ”,Otherwise there will be trouble ! '
秦香 二人 就 急 得 飞红 的 脸 ， 便 问道 ： “ 你 拿 住 什么 了 ？ ”,With furious blushes the other two protested indignantly that they did not know what he was talking about .
金荣笑 道 ： “ 我 现 拿 住 了 是 真的 。 ”,"Jokey Jin grinned . ' Caught you in the act , did not I ? '"
说 着 又 拍 着手 笑 嚷 道 ： “ 贴 的 好 烧饼 ！,"He began to clap his hands and chant in a loud , guffawing voice , ' Bum-cake ! Bum-cake !"
你们 都 不 买 一个 吃 去 ？ ”,Let is all have a Bit to eat ! '
秦钟香 怜 二人 又 气 又 急 ， 忙 进来 向 贾瑞前 告 金荣 ， 说 金荣 无故 欺负 他 两个 。,"Angry and indignant , Qin Zhong and Darling hurried back into the classroom and complained to Jia Rui that Jokey Jin was persecuting them ."
原来 这 贾瑞 最 是 个 图 便宜 没 行止 的 人 ， 每 在 学中 以 公报 私 ， 勒索 子弟 们 请 他 ；,"This Jia Rui was a spineless , unprincipled character who , as a means of obliging the boys to treat him , always displayed the most shameless favouritism in his settlement of class-room disputes ."
后 又 助 着 薛蟠图 些 银钱 酒肉 ， 一任 薛蟠 横行霸道 ， 他 不但 不 去 管 约 ， 反 “ 助纣为虐 ” 讨好 儿 。,"In return for money , drinks , and dinners , he had lately given Xue Pan a free hand in his nefarious activities - had , indeed , not only refrained from interfering with him , but even ' aided the tyrant in his tyranny ' ."
偏 那 薛蟠本 是 浮萍 心性 ， 今日 爱东 ， 明日 爱西 ， 近来 有 了 新 朋友 ， 把 香玉 二人 丢开 一边 ； — — 就 连金荣 也 是 当日 的 好友 ， 自有 了 香玉 二人 ， 便 见弃 了 金荣 ； 近日 连香玉 亦 已 见弃 。,"Now Xue Pan was very inconstant in his affections , always blowing east one day and west the next . He had recently abandoned Darling and Precious in favour of some newly discovered sweetheart , just as previously he had abandoned Jokey Jin in favour of Darling and Precious ."
故 贾瑞 也 无 了 提携 帮衬 之 人 ， 不怨 薛蟠 得 新厌故 ， 只 怨 香玉 二人 不 在 薛蟠 跟前 提携 了 ： 因此 贾 瑞金 荣 等 一干 人 ， 也 正 醋妒 他 两个 。,"It followed that in this present confrontation Jia Rui , to his chagrin , could not hope to gain any rewards by the exercise of his usual partiality . Instead of blaming this vexatious state of affairs on Xue Pan is fickleness , however , he directed all his resentment against Darling and Precious , for whom he felt the same unreasonable jealousy as motivated Jokey Jin and the rest ."
今 见 秦香 二人 来告 金荣 ， 贾瑞 心中 便 不自在 起来 ， 虽 不敢 呵叱 秦钟 ， 却 拿 着 香怜 作法 ， 反说 他 多 事 ， 着实 抢白 了 几句 。 香怜 反讨 了 没趣 ， 连秦钟 也 讪讪 的 各 归 坐位 去 了 。,"Qin Zhong 's and Darling 's complaint at first put Jia Rui in somewhat of a quandary , for he dared not openly rebuke Qin Zhong . He could , however , give his resentment outlet by making an example of Darling ; so instead of dealing with his complaint , he told him that he was a trouble-maker and followed this up with so savage a dressing-down that even Qin Zhong went back to his seat humiliated and crestfallen ."
金荣 越发 得 了 意 ， 摇头 咂嘴 的 ， 口内 还 说 许多 闲话 ， 玉爱 偏 又 听见 ， 两个 人 隔 坐 咕咕 唧唧 的 角 起 口 来 。,"Jokey Jin , now thoroughly cock-a-hoop , wagged his head and tutted in a most provoking manner and addressed wounding remarks to no one in particular , which greatly upset Darling and Precious for whose ears they were intended . A furious muttered altercation broke out between them across the intervening desks ."
金荣 只 一口咬定 说 ： “ 方才 明明 的 撞见 他 两个 在 后 院里 亲嘴 摸 屁股 ， 两个 商议 定 了 ， 一对 儿 论长道短 。 ”,"Jokey Jin insisted that he had caught Qin Zhong and Darling n flagrante delicto . ' I ran into them in the back courtyard , kissing each other and feeling arses as plain as anything . I tell you they had it all worked out . They were just measuring themselves for size before getting down to business . '"
那时 只顾 得志 乱说 ， 却 不 防 还有 别人 ， 谁知 早 又 触怒 了 一个 人 。,"Reckless in his hour of triumph , he made these wild allegations , unmindful of who might hear them ."
你 道 这 一个 人 是 谁 ？,But one heroic soul was moved to mighty anger by his wanton words .
原来 这 人 名唤 贾蔷 ， 亦 系 宁府中 之 正派 玄孙 ， 父母 早 亡 ， 从小儿 跟着 贾珍 过活 ， 如今 长 了 十六岁 ， 比 贾蓉 生 得 还 风流 俊俏 。 他 兄弟二人 最 相亲 厚 ， 常共 起居 ， 宁府中 人多口杂 ， 那些 不得志 的 奴仆 ， 专能 造言 诽谤 主人 ， 因此 不知 又 有 什么 小人 诟谇 谣诼 之 辞 。 贾珍想 亦 风闻 得 些 口声 不好 ， 自己 也 要 避 些 嫌疑 ， 如今 竟分 与 房舍 ， 命 贾蔷 搬出 宁府 ， 自己 立 门户 过活 去 了 。,"This was Jia Qiang , a member of the Ning-guo branch of the family of the same generation as Jia Rong . He had lost both his parents when a small child and been brought up by Cousin Zhen . At sixteen he was even more handsome and dashing than Jia Rong and the two youths were inseparable friends . Any establishment as large as the Ning household always contains a few disgruntled domestics who specialize in traducing their masters , and a number of disagreeable rumours concerning Jia Qiang did in fact begin to circulate among the servants which seem to have reached the ears of Cousin Zhen , for , partly in self-defence ( since they involved him too ) , he moved Jia Qiang out of the house and set him up in a small establishment of his own , somewhere in the city ."
这 贾蔷 外相 既 美 ， 内性 又 聪敏 ， 虽然 应名 来 上学 ， 亦 不过 虚掩 眼目 而已 ； 仍 是 斗鸡走狗 、 赏花 阅 柳 为 事 。,"Jia Qiang possessed a very shrewd brain under his dazzlingly handsome exterior . His attendance at the school , however , was no more than a blind to his other activities , principal among which were cock-fighting , dog-racing , and botanizing excursions into the Garden of Pleasure ;"
上有 贾珍 溺爱 ， 下有 贾蓉 匡助 ， 因此 族 中 人 谁 敢 触逆 于 他 。,"but with a doting Cousin Zhen to protect him on the one hand and Jia Rong to aid and comfort him on the other , there was no one in the clan who dared thwart him in anything he did ."
他 既 和 贾蓉 最好 ， 今 见 有人 欺负 秦钟 ， 如何 肯依 ？,"Since Qin Zhong was the brother-in-law of his best friend , Jia Qiang was naturally unwilling to stand by and see him abused in so despiteful a manner without doing anything to help ."
如今 自己 要 挺身 出来 报 不平 ， 心中 且 忖度 一番 ： “ 金荣 贾瑞 一等 人 ， 都 是 薛大叔 的 相知 ， 我 又 与 薛大叔 相好 ， 倘或 我 一出头 ， 他们 告诉 了 老 薛 ， 我们 岂 不伤和气 呢 。,"On the other hand he reflected that there would be certain disadvantages in coming forward as his champion . ' Jokey Jin , Jia Rui , and that lot are all friends of Uncle Xue , ' he thought . ' For that matter , I am a friend of Uncle Xue myself . If I openly stick up for Qin Zhong and they go and tell old Xue , it will make things rather awkward between us ."
欲 要 不管 ， 这 谣言 说 的 大家 没趣 。,"On the other hand , if I do not interfere at all , Jokey Jin is rumours are going to get quite out of hand ."
如今 何不 用 计 制伏 ， 又 止息 了 口声 ， 又 不伤 脸面 。 ”,This calls for a stratagem of some kind which will shut the little beast up without causing too much embarrassment afterwards . '
想毕 ， 也 装出 小 恭 去 ， 走 至 后面 ， 悄悄 把 跟 宝玉 书童 茗 烟 叫 至 身边 ， 如此这般 ， 调拨 他 几句 。,"Having thought of a plan , he pretended that he wanted to be excused , and slipping round to the back , quietly called over Bao-yu 's little page Tealeaf and whispered a few inflammatory words in his ear ."
这 茗 烟 乃是 宝玉 第一个 得用 且 又 年轻 不谙 事 的 ， 今 听 贾 蔷说 ： “ 金荣 如此 欺负 秦钟 ， 连 你们 的 爷 宝玉 都 干 连 在内 ， 不 给 他个 知道 ， 下次 越发 狂纵 。 ”,"Tealeaf was the most willing but also the youngest and least sensible of Bao-yu is pages . Jia Qiang told him how Jokey Jin had been bullying Qin Zhong . ' And even Bao-yu came in for a share , ' he said . ' If we do not take this Jin fellow down a peg , next time he is going to be quite insufferable . '"
这 茗 烟 无故 就要 欺压 人 的 ， 如今 得 了 这 信 ， 又 有 贾蔷助 着 ， 便 一头 进来 找 金荣 ， 也 不 叫 “ 金 相公 ” 了 ， 只 说 ： “ 姓金 的 ， 你 什么 东西 ！ ”,"Tealeaf never needed any encouragement to pick a fight , and now inflamed by Jia Qiang 's message and open incitement to action , he marched straight into the classroom to look for Jokey Jin . And there was no ' Master Jin ' when he saw him , either : ' it was Jin ! Who do you think you are ? '"
— — 贾蔷遂 跺 一 跺 靴子 ， 故意 整整 衣服 、 看看 日影儿 说 ： “ 正 时候 了 。 ”,"At this point Jia Qiang began to scrape his boots on the floor and make a great business of straightening his clothes and glancing out of the window at the sky , muttering to himself as he did so , Ah , yes . Hmn . Must be about time . '"
遂 先 向 贾瑞 说 有事 要 早走一步 。 贾瑞 不敢 止 他 ， 只得 随 他 去 了 。,"Going up to Jia Rui , he informed him that he had an engagement which necessitated his leaving early , and Jia Rui , not having the courage to stop him , allowed him to slip away ."
这里 茗 烟 走进 来 ， 便 一把 揪住 金荣 问道 ： “ 我们 肏 屁股 不 肏 屁股 ， 管 你 𣬠 𣬶 相干 ？,"Tealeaf had by now singled out Jokey Jin and grabbed him by the front of his jacket . ' Whether we fuck arseholes or not , ' he said , ' what fucking business is it of yours ?"
横竖 没 肏 你 的 爹 罢了 ！,You should be bloody grateful we haven ' t fucked your dad .
你 是 好 小子 ， 出来 动一动 你 茗 大爷 ！ ”,"Come outside and fight it out with me , if you have got any spunk in you ! '"
吓 的 满屋 中 子弟 都芒芒 的 痴望 。,
贾瑞忙 喝 ： “ 茗 烟 不得 撒野 ！ ”,' Tealeaf ! ' Jia Rui shouted agitatedly . ' You are not to use such language in here ! '
金荣 气 黄 了 脸 ， 说 ： “ 反 了 ！,Jokey Jin 's face turned pale with anger . ' This is mutiny !
奴才 小子 都 敢 如此 ， 我 只 和 你 主子 说 。 ”,I do not have to take this sort of thing from a slave . I shall see your master about this '
便 夺手 要 去 抓 打 宝玉 。,"- and he shook himself free of Tealeaf and made for Bao-yu , intending to seize and belabour him ."
秦钟刚 转 出身 来 ， 听 得 脑 后 飕 的 一声 ， 早 见 一方 砚 瓦 飞来 ， 并 不知 系 何人 打 来 ， 却 打 了 贾蓝 贾菌 的 座 上 。,"As Qin Zhong turned to watch the onslaught , he heard a rushing noise behind his head and a square inkstone launched by an unseen hand sailed past it and landed on the desk occupied by Jia Lan and Jia Jun ."
这 贾蓝贾 菌 亦 系 荣府 近派 的 重孙 。,"Jia Lan and Jia Jun belonged to the Rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same generation as the other Jia Lan , the little son of Li Wan and nephew of Bao-yu ."
这 贾菌 少 孤 ， 其 母 疼爱 非常 ， 书房 中 与 贾蓝 最好 ， 所以 二人 同 坐 。,"Jia Jun had lost his father in infancy and was doted on by his widowed mother . Jia Lan was his best friend , which is why they always sat next to each other in school ."
谁知 这 贾菌 年纪 虽 小 ， 志气 最大 ， 极 是 淘气 不怕 人 的 。,"Though Jia Jun was among the youngest in the class , his tiny body contained an heroic soul . He was extremely mischievous and completely fearless ."
他 在位 上 ， 冷眼 看见 金荣 的 朋友 暗助 金荣 ， 飞砚 来 打 茗 烟 ， 偏 打错 了 落 在 自己 面前 ， 将 个 磁砚 水壶 儿 打 粉碎 ， 溅 了 一 书 墨水 。,"With the impartial interest of an observer he had watched a friend of Jokey Jin is slyly aim the inkstone at Tealeaf ; but when it fell short and landed right in front of him on his own desk , smashing a porcelain water-bottle and showering his books with inky water , his blood was up ."
贾菌 如何 依得 ， 便 骂 ： “ 好 囚 攮 的 们 ！,' Rotten swine ! ' he shouted .
这 不 都 动 了 手 了 么 ！ ” 骂 着 ， 也 便 抓起 砚台 来 要 飞 。,"' If this is a free-for-all , here goes ! ' and he grabbed at the inkstone intending to send it sailing back ."
贾蓝 是 个 省事 的 ， 忙 按住 砚台 ， 忙 劝道 ： “ 好 兄弟 ， 不 与 咱们 相干 。 ”,"But Jia Lan was a man of peace and held it firmly down . ' Leave it , old chap ! It is none of our business , ' he counselled ."
贾菌 如何 忍得 住 ， 见 按住 砚台 ， 他 便 两手 抱 起 书箧 子 来 ， 照 这边 扔 去 。,"Jia Jun was not to be restrained , however . Deprived of the inkstone , he picked up a satchel full of books and raising it in both hands above his head , hurled it in the direction of the assailant ."
终是 身小力薄 ， 却 扔 不到 ， 反 扔 到 宝玉 秦钟 案 上 就 落下来 了 。,"Unfortunately his body was too small and his strength too puny for so great a trajectory , and the satchel fell on the desk occupied by Bao-yu and Qin Zhong ."
只 听 豁 啷 一响 ， 砸 在 桌上 ， 书本 、 纸片 、 笔 、 砚 等 物 ， 撒 了 一桌 ； 又 把 宝玉 的 一碗 茶 也 砸 得 碗 碎 茶流 。,"It landed with a tremendous crash , scattering books , papers , writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing Bao-yu 's teabowl to smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about ."
那 贾菌 即便 跳 出来 ， 要 揪打 那飞砚 的 人 。,"Nothing daunted , Jia Jun leaped out and rushed upon the thrower of inkstones to smite him ."
金荣 此时 随手 抓 了 一根 毛竹 大板 在手 ， 地 狭 人 多 ， 那里 经得 舞动 长板 。,Meanwhile Jokey Jin had found a bamboo pole which he flailed around him : a terrible weapon in so confined and crowded a space .
茗 烟 早 吃 了 一下 ， 乱 嚷 ： “ 你们 还 不来 动手 ？ ”,Soon Tealeaf had sustained a blow from it and was bawling for reinforcements from outside .
宝玉 还有 几个 小厮 ： 一名 扫 红 ， 一名 锄药 ， 一名 墨雨 ， 这 三个 岂 有 不 淘气 的 ， 一齐 乱 嚷 ： “ 小 妇养 的 ！ 动 了 兵器 了 ！ ” 墨雨遂 掇 起 一根 门闩 ， 扫 红 、 锄药 手中 都 是 马鞭子 ， 蜂拥而上 。,"There were three other pages in attendance on Bao-yu besides himself , all equally inclined to mischief . Their names were Sweeper , Ploughboy and Inky . With a great shout of ' To arms ! To arms ! Down with the bastards ! ' these three now came rushing like angry hornets into the classroom , Inky wielding a door-bar which he had picked up and Sweeper and Ploughboy brandishing horsewhips ."
贾瑞 急 得 拦 一回 这个 ， 劝 一回 那个 ， 谁 听 他 的话 ？,"Jia Rui , in a frenzy of outraged authority , hopped from one to the other , alternately grabbing and cajoling , but none would take the slightest bit of notice ."
肆行 大乱 。,Disorder was now general .
众 顽童 也 有 帮 着 打 太平 拳助乐 的 ， 也 有 胆小 藏 过 一边 的 ， 也 有立 在 桌上 拍 着手 乱 笑 、 喝 着 声儿 叫 打 的 ：,"The more mischievous of the scholars mingled gleefully in the fray , safe , in the general scrimmage , to land punches at chosen foes without fear of discovery or reprisal . The more timid crawled into places of safety . Others stood on their desks , laughing and clapping their hands and cheering on the combatants ."
登时 鼎沸 起来 。,The classroom was like a cauldron of still water that had suddenly come to the boil .
外边 几个 大 仆人 李贵 等 听见 里边 作反 起来 ， 忙 都 进来 一齐 喝 住 ， 问 是 何故 ， 众声 不 一 ， 这 一个 如此 说 ， 那 一个 又 如 彼 说 。,"Li Gui and the other older servants , hearing the uproar from outside , now hurried in , and by concerted shouting eventually managed to call the boys to a halt . Li Gui asked them what they were fighting about . He was answered by a medley of voices , some saying one thing and some another ."
李贵 且 喝 骂 了 茗 烟 等 四个 一顿 ， 撵 了 出去 。,"Unable to make sense of what he heard , he turned his attention to Tealeaf and the other pages , cursing them roundly and turning them out of the room ."
秦钟 的 头 早 撞 在 金荣 的 板上 ， 打 去 一层 油皮 ， 宝玉 正 拿 褂 襟子 替 他 揉 ， 见 喝 住 了 众人 ， 便命 ：,"Qin Zhong had fallen an early victim to Jokey Jin is pole , sustaining a nasty graze on the head which Bao-yu was at this very moment mopping with the flap of his gown . Seeing that Li Gui had succeeded in restoring some kind of order , he asked to be taken away ."
“ 李贵 ， 收书 ！ 拉 马来 ， 我 去 回 太爷 去 ！,"' Pack up my books , Li Gui , and fetch the horse , will you ?"
我们 被 人 欺负 了 ， 不敢 说 别的 ， 守 礼 来 告诉 瑞 大爷 ， 瑞 大爷 反派 我们 的 不是 ， 听 着 人家 骂 我们 ， 还 调唆 人家 打 我们 。,"I am going to tell Greatuncle Dai-ru about this . We were shamefully insulted , and because we did not want to start a quarrel , we went along in a perfectly polite and reasonable manner and reported the matter to Cousin Rui . But instead of doing anything about it , he gave us a telling-off , stood by while someone called us filthy names , and actually encouraged them to start hitting us ."
茗 烟 见 人 欺负 我 ， 他 岂 有 不 为 我 的 ， 他们 反打 伙儿 打 了 茗 烟 ， 连秦钟 的 头 也 打破 了 。,"Naturally Tealeaf stuck up for us when he saw we were being bullied . What would you expect him to do ? But they all ganged up on him and started hitting 4im , and even Qin Zhong 's head was cut open ."
还 在 这里 念书 么 ？ ”,We can not go on studying here after this . '
李贵劝 道 ： “ 哥儿 不要 性急 ， 太爷 既有 事 回家 去 了 ， 这 会子 为 这 点子 事去 聒噪 他 老人家 ， 倒显 的 咱们 没礼 似的 。,"Li Gui tried to calm him . ' Do not be hasty , young master ! Your great-uncle has gone home on business and if we go running after him to pester him about a little thing like this , he will think we do not know how to behave ."
依 我 的 主意 ， 那里 的 事情 那里 了结 ， 何必 惊动 老人家 。,"If you want my advice , the proper way to settle this affair is by dealing with it here , where it started . Not by rushing of and upsetting your poor old uncle . '"
— — 这 都 是 瑞 大爷 的 不是 ， 太爷 不 在 家里 ， 你 老人家 就是 这 学 里 的 头脑 了 ， 众人 看 你 行事 。,"He turned to Jia Rui . ' This is all your fault , Mr Rui , sir . While your granfer is away you are the head of the whole school and everyone looks to you to set an example ."
众人 有 了 不是 ， 该 打 的 打 ， 该 罚 的 罚 ， 如何 等 闹 到 这步田地 还 不管 呢 ？ ”,"If anyone does anything they should not , it is up to you to deal with it - give them a hiding , or whatever it is they need . Not sit by and let matters get out of hand to this extent . '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 我 吆喝 着 都 不 听 。 ”,"' I did tell them to stop , ' said Jia Rui , ' but they would not listen . '"
李贵道 ： “ 不怕 你 老人家 恼 我 ： 素日 你 老人家 到底 有些 不是 ， 所以 这些 兄弟 不 听 。,"' If you do not mind my saying so , ' said Li Gui , ' it is because you have been to blame yourself on past occasions that these lads will not do what you tell them to now ."
就 闹 到 太爷 跟前 去 ， 连 你 老人家 也 脱不了 的 。,"So if this business today does get to the ears of your grandfather , you will be in trouble yourself , along of all the rest ."
还 不快 作 主意 撕 掳开 了 罢 ！ ”,"If I were you , sir , I should think of some way of sorting this out as quickly as possible . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 撕 掳 什么 ？,' Sort it out nothing ! ' said Bao-yu .
我 必要 回去 的 ！ ”,I am definitely going to report this . '
秦钟 哭 道 ： “ 有 金荣 在 这里 ， 〈 我 是 不 在 这里 念书 的 。 〉 ”,"' If Jokey Jin stays here , ' wailed Qin Zhong tearfully , ' I am not studying in this school any longer . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 这 是 为什么 ？,"' There is no earthly reason to talk about leaving this school , ' said Bao-yu ."
难道 别人 家 来得 ， 咱们 倒 来不得 的 ？,We have as much right to come here as anyone else .
我 必 回 明白 众人 ， 撵 了 金荣 去 。 ”,"When I have explained to everyone exactly what happened , Jokey Jin will be expelled . '"
又 问 李贵 ： “ 这 金荣 是 那一 房 的 亲戚 ？ ”,"' Who is this Jokey Jin , any way ? ' he asked Li Gui ."
李贵 想一想 ， 道 ： “ 也 不用 问 了 。,Li Gui thought for a moment . ' Better not ask .
若 说起 那一 房 亲戚 ， 更 伤 了 兄弟 们 的 和气 了 。 ”,"If I told you , it would only make for more unpleasantness . '"
茗 烟 在 窗外 道 ： “ 他 是 东府里 璜 大 奶奶 的 侄儿 ， 什么 硬挣 仗 腰子 的 ， 也 来 吓 我们 ！,Tealeaf 's voice piped up from outside the window : ' He is the nephew of Mrs Huang on the Ning-guo side . Trash like that trying to scare us !
璜 大 奶奶 是 他 姑妈 。,"I know your Auntie Huang , Jokey Jin !"
你 那 姑妈 只 会 打旋 磨儿 ， 给 我们 琏 二 奶奶 跪 着 借 当头 ， 我 眼里 就 看不起 他 那样 主子 奶奶 么 ！ ”,"She is an old scrounger . I have seen her down on her knees in front of our Mrs Lian , begging for stuff so that she could go out and pawn it . What an aunt ! I would be ashamed to own an aunt like that ! '"
李贵忙 喝道 ： “ 偏 这 小狗 攮 知道 ， 有 这些 蛆 嚼 ！ ”,Li Gui shouted at him furiously . ' Detestable little varmint ! Trust you to know the answer and spread your poison ! '
宝玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 只当 是 谁 的 亲戚 ， 原来 是 璜 嫂子 侄儿 ， 我 就 去向 他 问问 ！ ”,Bao-yu sniffed contemptuously . ' So that is who he is ! The nephew of Cousin Huang 's wife . I will go and speak to her about this . '
说 着 便 要 走 ， 叫 茗 烟 进来 包书 。,"He wanted to go straight away , and called to Tealeaf to come inside and pack up his books ."
茗 烟 进来 包书 ， 又 得意洋洋 的 道 ： “ 爷 也 不用 自己 去 见 他 ， 等 我 去 找 他 ， 就 说 老太太 有 话 问 他 呢 ， 雇上 一辆 车子 拉进去 ， 当着 老太太 问 他 ， 岂 不 省事 ？ ”,"' No need for you to go , Master Bao , said Tealeaf as he swaggered in triumphantly to do his bidding . ' Let me go for you and save you the trouble . I will just say that Lady Jia wants a word with her , hire a carriage , and bring her along myself . Then you can question her in front of Lady Jia . '"
李贵忙 喝道 ： “ 你 要死 啊 ！,Li Gui was furious . ' Do you want to die ?
仔细 回去 我 好不好 先 捶 了 你 ， 然后 回 老爷 、 太太 ， 就 说 宝哥儿 全 是 你 调唆 的 。,"If you are not careful , my lad , when we get home I will first thrash the living daylights out of you and then tell Sir Zheng and Lady Wang that Master Bao was put up to all this by your provocation ."
我 这里 好容易 劝哄 的 好 了 一半 ， 你 又 来生 了 新 法儿 ！,I have had trouble enough as it is trying to get these lads calmed down a bit without needing any fresh trouble from you .
你 闹 了 学堂 ， 不 说 变 个 法儿 压息 了 才 是 ， 还 往 火 里 奔 ！ ”,"It was all of your making , this rumpus , in the first place . But instead of thinking about ways of damping it down , you have to go throwing more fat on the fire . '"
茗 烟 听 了 ， 方 不敢 做 声 。,After this outburst Tealeaf was at last silent .
此时 贾瑞 也 生恐 闹 不 清 ， 自己 也 不 干净 。,Jia Rui was by now terrified lest the matter should go any further and his own far from clean record be brought to light .
只得 委曲 着来 央告 秦钟 ， 又 央告 宝玉 。,"Fear made him abject . Addressing Qin Zhong and Bao-yu in turn , he humbly begged them not to report it ."
先是 他 二人 不肯 ， 后来 宝玉 说 ： “ 不 回去 也罢 了 ， 只 叫 金荣 赔不是 便 罢 。 ”,"At first they were adamant . Then Bao-yu made a condition : ' All right , we will not tell . But you must make Jokey Jin apologize . '"
金荣 先是 不肯 ， 后来 经 不得 贾瑞 也 来 逼 他 权 赔 个 不是 ， 李贵 等 只得 好 劝 金荣 ， 说 ： “ 原来 是 你 起 的 头儿 ， 你 不 这样 ， 怎么 了 局 呢 ？ ”,"At first Jokey Jin refused , but Jia Rui was insistent , and Li Gui added his own persuasion : ' After all , it started with you , so if you do not do what they say , how are we ever going to end it ? '"
金荣强 不过 ， 只得 与 秦钟 作 了 个 揖 。,Under their combined pressure Jokey Jin 's resistance at last gave way and he locked hands and made Qin Zhong a bow .
宝玉 还 不依 ， 定 要 磕头 。,But Bao-yu said this was not enough . He insisted on a kotow .
贾瑞 只要 暂息 此事 ， 又 悄悄的 劝 金荣 说 ： “ 俗语说 的 ： ‘ 忍 得 一时 忿 ， 终身 无 恼闷 。 ’ ”,"Jia Rui , whose only concern now was to get the matter over with as quickly as possible , quietly urged him to comply : ' You know what the proverb says : He who can check a moment 's rage Shall calm and carefree end his days . '"
未知 金荣 从 也 不 从 ， 下回分解 。,Did Jokey Jin comply ? The following chapter will reveal .
第十回,Chapter 10
金 寡妇 贪 利权 受辱,Widow Jin 's self-interest gets the better of her righteous indignation
张 太医 论病 细穷源,And Doctor Zhang 's diagnosis reveals the origin of a puzzling disease
话 说 金荣 因 人多势众 ， 又 兼 贾瑞 勒令 赔 了 不是 ， 给 秦钟 磕 了 头 ， 宝玉 方才 不 吵闹 了 。,"Outnumbered , and hard pressed by Jia Rui to apologize , Jokey Jin made a kotow to Qin Zhong , whereupon Bao-yu agreed to let the matter drop ."
大家 散 了 学 ， 金荣 自己 回到 家中 ， 越 想越 气 ， 说 ：,"Back in his own home , when school was over , he brooded with mounting anger on his humiliation ."
“ 秦钟 不过 是 贾蓉 的 小舅子 ， 又 不是 贾家 的 子孙 ， 附学 读书 ， 也 不过 和 我 一样 ， 因 他 仗 着 宝玉 和 他 相好 ， 就 目中无人 。,"' Qin Zhong is Jia Rong 's brother-in-law : it is not as if he were one of the Jia clan . He is only an external scholar , the same as me ; and it is only because he is friends with Bao-yu that he can afford to be so high and mighty ."
既 是 这样 ， 就 该 干 些 正经事 ， 也 没 的说 ；,"Well , in that case he ought to behave himself , then no one would have any cause to complain ."
他 素日 又 和 宝玉 鬼鬼祟祟 的 ， 只当 人家 都 是 瞎子 ， 看不见 。,"But he is always carrying on in such a sneaky , underhand way with Bao-yu , as though he thought the rest of us were all blind and could not see what he was up to ."
今日 他 又 去 勾搭 人 ， 偏偏 撞 在 我 眼里 ， 就是 闹 出事 来 ， 我 还 怕 什么 不成 ？ ”,And now today he is started making up to someone else and I happen to have found him out . So what if there were a row about this ? I have got nothing to be afraid of . '
他 母亲 胡氏 听见 他 咕咕 唧唧 的 ， 说 ： “ 你 又 要 管 什么 闲事 ？,"His mother , Widow Jin , overheard his muttering . ' What have you been getting up to this time ? ' she asked ."
好容易 我 和 你 姑妈 说 了 ， 你 姑妈 又 千方百计 的 和 他们 西府里 琏 二 奶奶 跟前 说 了 ， 你 才 得 了 这个 念书 的 地方 儿 。,' Look at the job we had getting you into that school . All the talks I had with your aunt and the trouble she went to to see Mrs Lian about it .
若 不是 仗 着 人家 ， 咱们 家里 还有 力量 请 的 起 先生 么 ？,"Suppose we had not had their help in getting you in there , we could never have afforded a tutor ."
况且 人家 学里 ， 茶饭 都 是 现成 的 ， 你 这 二年 在 那里 念书 ， 家里 也 省好大 的 嚼用 呢 ！,"What is more , you get free tea and free dinners there , do not you ? That has meant a big saving for us during the two years you have been going there ."
省 出来 的 ， 你 又 爱 穿件 体面 衣裳 。,"And you are glad enough to have something decent to wear out of the money saved , are not you ?"
再者 你 不在 那里 念书 ， 你 就 认得 什么 薛大爷 了 ？,"And another thing . If you had not been going to that school , how would you ever have met that Mr Xue of yours ?"
那 薛大爷 一年 也 帮 了 咱们 七八十两 银子 。,"Between seventy and eighty taels of silver we have had out of him during this past year . I can tell you this , my boy ."
你 如今 要 闹出 了 这个 学房 ， 再 想 找 这么 个 地方 儿 ， 我 告诉 你 说 罢 ， 比登 天 的 还 难 呢 ！,"If you get yourself thrown out of there , you need not think you can get in anywhere else , because you could easier fly to the moon than find another place like that ."
你 给 我 老老实实 的 玩 一会 子 睡 你 的 觉去 ， 好 多着呢 ！ ”,Now you just play quietly for a bit and then go to bed like a good boy ! '
于是 金荣 忍气吞声 ， 不 多 一时 ， 也 自 睡觉 去 了 。 次日 仍旧 上学 去 了 ， 不在话下 。,"Thus admonished , Jokey Jin swallowed his anger and fell silent . Before long he went to bed and to sleep , and next day was back at the school again as usual . Of him no more ."
且说 他 姑妈 原给 了 贾家 “ 玉 ” 字辈 的 嫡派 ， 名唤 贾璜 ， 但其 族人 那里 皆 能 象 宁荣二 府 的 家势 ？ 原 不用 细说 。,"Jokey Jin 's aunt was married to one Jia Huang , a member of the Jia clan in the same generation as Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian . It goes without saying , of course , that not all members of the clan lived in the sort of style maintained by the Ning and Rong households ."
这 贾璜 夫妻 ， 守 着 些 小小的 产业 ， 又 时常 到 宁荣二 府 里 去 请安 ， 又 会 奉承 凤姐儿 并 尤氏 ， 所以 凤姐儿 尤氏 也 时常 资助 资助 他 ， 方 能 如此 度日 。,"Jia Huang and his wife had only the income from a very small property to live on , and it was only by dint of frequent visits to the Ning and Rong mansions , where their flattering attentions on Wang Xi-feng and You-shi earned them an occasional subsidy , that they were able to make ends meet ."
今日 正 遇 天气晴朗 ， 又 值 家中 无 事 ， 遂 带 了 一个 婆子 ， 坐 上车 ， 来 家里 走走 ， 瞧瞧 嫂子 和 侄儿 。,"Today the weather was fine and sunny and Mrs Huang had nothing particular to do at home , so taking an old serving-woman with her , she got into a cab and went off to pay a call on her sister-in-law and nephew ."
说起 话儿 来 ， 金荣 的 母亲 偏 提起 昨日 贾家学 房里 的 事 ， 从头至尾 ， 一五一十 ， 都 和 他 小姑子 说 了 。,"In the course of conversation Widow Jin soon got on to the subject of yesterday 's affair in the schoolroom and launched into a full account , from which no detail was omitted , of all those happenings ."
这 璜 大 奶奶 不 听 则 已 ， 听 了 ， 怒 从 心上 起 ， 说道 ：,"It would have been as well for her if she had not done so , for the effect was to kindle a dangerous anger in the bosom of her sister-in-law ."
“ 这 秦钟 小杂种 是 贾门 的 亲戚 ， 难道 荣儿 不是 贾门 的 亲戚 ？,"' That little beast Qin Zhong ! ' said Mrs Huang . ' He may be related to the Jias , by marriage , but then so is your boy ."
也别 太 势利 了 ！,"What business has he to go throwing his weight about like that , I should like to know ?"
况且 都 做 的 是 什么 有 脸 的 事 ！,Especially after the disgusting things he had been doing himself .
就是 宝玉 也 不犯 向着 他 到 这个 田地 。,"Considering what had been up to , even Bao-yu ought not to have sided with him to that extent ."
等 我 到 东府里 瞧瞧 我们 珍大 奶奶 ， 再 和 秦钟 的 姐姐 说 说 ， 叫 他 评评理 ！ ”,Let me go and see Mrs Zhen about this . I shall ask her to let me have it out with Qin Zhong 's sister and see if we can not get some satisfaction . '
金荣 的 母亲 听 了 ， 急 的 了不得 ， 忙 说道 ： “ 这 都 是 我 的 嘴快 ， 告诉 了 姑奶奶 ， 求 姑奶奶 快别 去 说 罢 ！,"' Oh dear , I should not talk so much ! I never meant to tell you this . Please , my dear , I beg of you not to speak to them about it !"
别管 他们 谁是谁非 ， 倘或 闹出来 ， 怎么 在 那里 站 的 住 ？,"Never mind the rights and wrongs of the case , if this all gets out , they will make it too hot for my boy to stay on at the school ;"
要 站不住 ， 家里 不但 不能 请 先生 ， 还 得 他 身上 添出 许多 嚼 用来 呢 ！ ”,"and if he had to stop going to the school , we should never be able to afford a tutor for him , quite apart from all the extra expense I should have of feeding him during the day . '"
璜 大 奶奶 说道 ： “ 那里 管 的 那些 个 ？,' Never mind about all that ! ' said Mrs Huang .
等 我 说 了 ， 看 是 怎么样 ！ ”,' We will worry about that after I have spoken to them and seen what happens . '
也 不容 他 嫂子 劝 ， 一面 叫 老婆子 瞧 了 车 ， 坐 上 竟 往 宁府 里来 。,"Dismissing her sister-in-law 's entreaties , she sent the old servant-woman out for a cab , and getting inside , drove straight off to the Ning-guo mansion ."
到 了 宁府 ， 进 了 东 角门 ， 下 了 车 ， 进去 见 了 尤氏 ， 那里 还有 大气 儿 ？ 殷殷勤勤 叙 过 了 寒温 ， 说 了 些 闲话 儿 ， 方 问道 ： “ 今日 怎么 没见 蓉 大 奶奶 ？ ”,"But by the time she had reached it , driven in at the east end gate , dismounted from the carriage and gone in to see You-shi , the edge had already worn off her anger , and it was only after deferential inquiries about the health and comfort of her hostess and various other inconsequential matters that she got around to asking what had become of Qin-shi , who was usually in evidence during her visits ."
尤氏 说 ： “ 他 这些 日子 不知 怎么 了 ， 经期 有 两个 多月 没有 来 。 叫 大夫 瞧 了 ， 又 说 并 不是 喜 。,"' I do not know what is the matter with her lately , ' said You-shi . ' It is been more than two months now since she had a period , yet the doctors say she is not pregnant ."
那 两日 ， 到 下 半日 就 懒怠 动 了 ： 话 也 懒怠 说 ， 神 也 发 涅 。,And during the last few days she is been getting so tired and listless in the afternoons : does not feel like doing anything ; does not even feel like talking ; all the spirit seems to have gone out of her .
我 叫 他 ： ‘ 你 且 不必 拘礼 ， 早晚 不必 照例 上来 ， 你 竟 养养 儿 罢 。,"I have said to her , "" Never mind about wifely duties . Just forget about the morning and evening visits and concentrate on getting better ."
就 有 亲戚 来 ， 还有 我 呢 。,"Even when relations call , "" I said , "" I can see to them myself ."
别的 长辈 怪 你 ， 等 我 替 你 告诉 。 ’,"And never mind what the older members of the family might say : I will do all the explaining for you . """
连蓉 哥儿 我 都 嘱咐 了 ， 我 说 ： ‘ 你 不许 累措 他 ， 不许 招 他 生气 ， 叫 他 静静 儿 的 养 几天 就 好 了 。,"I have spoken to Rong , as well . "" You are not to tire her out , "" I told him , "" and you are not to let her get upset ! She must just rest quietly for a few days and look after herself ."
他 要 想 什么 吃 ， 只管 到 我 屋里 来取 。,"And if there is anything she fancies to eat , just come to my apartment to get it ."
倘或 他 有个 好歹 ， 你 再 要 娶 这么 一个 媳妇儿 ， 这么 个 模样儿 ， 这么 个 性格 儿 ， 只怕 “ 打着灯笼 儿 也 没处 找去 ” 呢 ！ ’,"Because if anything should happen to her , "" I said , "" you would not find another wife like that , with her looks and her good nature , if you took a lantern to look for her . """
他 这 为 人行 事儿 ， 那个 亲戚 长辈 儿 不 喜欢 他 ？,"She is such a sweet person , there is not anyone among our relations or among the older members of the family who does not love her ."
所以 我 这 两日 心里 很烦 。,I have been so worried on her account these last few days .
偏偏 儿 的 早起 他 兄弟 来 瞧 他 ， 谁知 那 小孩子 家 不知好歹 ， 看见 他 姐姐 身上 不好 ， 这些 事 也 不当 告诉 他 ， 就 受 了 万分 委曲 也 不该 向着 他 说 ！,"And just to make matters worse , first thing this morning her young brother comes along - Silly little boy ! he ought to have realized that his sister was not well and not in a condition to listen to such things , even if he would suffered ten thousand times the injustice !"
— — 谁知 昨日 学 房里 打架 ， 不知 是 那里 附学 的 学生 ， 倒 欺负 他 ， 里头 还 有些 不干不净 的话 ， 都 告诉 了 他 姐姐 。,- It seems that yesterday there was a fight at the school . One of the external students - I do not know which one it was - had been bullying him ; and there were a lot of other very nasty things as well . So he had to go and tell all this to his sister .
婶子 ， 你 是 知道 的 ： 那 媳妇 虽则 见 了 人 有说有笑 的 ， 他 可 心细 ， 不拘 听见 什么 话儿 ， 都 要 忖量 个 三日 五夜 才 算 。,"Well , you know how sensitive she is , my dear , in spite of the fact that she always seems so lively and full of fun to talk to . The slightest little thing can upset her and set her brooding on it for whole days and nights together ."
这 病 就是 打 这 ‘ 用心 太 过 ’ 上得 的 。,"In fact , this illness has been brought on by too much worrying , I am sure of it ."
今儿 听见 有人 欺负 了 他 的 兄弟 ， 又 是 恼 ， 又 是 气 ：,"Well , this morning when she heard that someone had been bullying her brother , it both upset her and at the same time made her angry ."
恼 的 是 那 狐朋狗友 ， 搬弄是非 ， 调三窝四 ； 气 的 是 为 他 兄弟 不 学好 ， 不上 心念 书 ， 才 弄 的 学 房里 吵闹 。,"She was upset to think that those horrible boys at the school should be able to twist things round and say such terrible things about him , but she was also angry with him , because she said he must have been getting into bad ways and not giving his mind properly to his studies to have got into trouble of this sort in the first place ."
他 为 这件 事 ， 索性 连 早饭 还 没 吃 。,"So of course , because of this upset she would not have any breakfast ."
我 才 到 他 那边 解劝 了 他 一会 子 ， 又 嘱咐 了 他 的 兄弟 几句 ， 我 叫 他 兄弟 到 那边 府 里 又 找 宝玉 儿 去 ； 我 又 瞧 着 他 吃 了 半钟 儿 燕窝汤 ， 我 才 过来 了 ：,"I have just been round there trying to calm her . I gave her brother a talking-to and sent him round to see Bao-yu , and I stood over her while she ate half a bowlful of bird ' s-nest soup . I have only just this minute got back ."
婶子 ， 你 说 我 心焦 不 心焦 ？,"Oh , I am so worried about her , my dear !"
况且 目今 又 没 个好 大夫 ， 我 想到 他 病 上 ， 我 心里 如同 针扎 的 一般 ！,"We haven ' t got a good doctor at the moment , either . It pierces me to the heart when I think about that child 's illness !"
你们 知道 有 什么 好 大夫 没有 ？ ”,"I suppose you do not happen to know of a good doctor , do you ? '"
金氏 听 了 这 一番话 ， 把 方才 在 他 嫂子 家 的 那 一团 要 向 秦氏 理论 的 盛气 ， 早 吓 的 丢 在 爪洼国 去 了 。,"Mrs Huang is determination to have things out with Qin-shi , of which she had boasted so valiantly at her sister-in-law 's , had , in the course of this outpouring , fled to the far kingdom of Java ."
— — 听见 尤氏 问 他 好 大夫 的话 ， 连忙 答道 ： “ 我们 也 没 听见 人 说 什么 好 大夫 。,She hastened to own that she knew of no good doctor .
如今 听起 大 奶奶 这个 病来 ， 定 不得 还是 喜 呢 。,"' But hearing what you have said about this illness , ' she added , ' I can not help wondering if it may not after all be pregnancy ."
嫂子 倒 别教 人 混治 ， 倘若 治错 了 ， 可 了不得 ！ ”,"You want to be careful they do not give her the wrong treatment . If they give her the wrong treatment for that , there will be real trouble ! '"
尤氏 道 ： “ 正是 呢 。 ”,"' I know , ' said You-shi . ' That is what I say . '"
说话 之间 ， 贾珍 从外 进来 ， 见 了 金氏 ， 便 问 尤氏 道 ： “ 这 不是 璜 大 奶奶 么 ？ ”,"While they were still talking , Cousin Zhen came in from outside . ' Is not this Cousin Huang is wife ? ' he asked You-shi , catching sight of the visitor ."
金氏 向前 给 贾珍 请 了 安 ， 贾珍 向 尤氏 说 ： “ 你 让 大 妹妹 吃了饭 去 。 ” 贾珍 说 着 话 便 向 那 屋里 去 了 。,"Mrs Huang dropped him a curtsey and a ' how-do-you-do ' . ' You must ask our cousin to dinner , ' he said , going on into the room beyond ."
金氏 此来 原要 向 秦氏 说 秦钟 欺负 他 侄儿 的 事 ， 听见 秦氏 有 病 ， 连提 也 不敢 提 了 。 况且 贾珍尤 氏 又 待 的 甚好 ， 因 转怒 为喜 的 ， 又 说 了 一会 子 闲话 ， 方家 去 了 。,"The original object of Mrs Huang 's visit had of course been to complain to Qin-shi about Qin Zhong is treatment of her nephew . Hearing of Qin-shi 's illness she had abandoned all thought of even mentioning the subject ; and now that Cousin Zhen and You-shi were being so nice to her , her anger gradually gave way to pleasure , and after gossiping a while longer she went off home ."
金氏 去 后 ， 贾珍方 过来 坐下 ， 问 尤氏 道 ： “ 今日 他 来 又 有 什么 说 的 ？ ”,"When she had gone , Cousin Zhen came in again and sat down . ' What did she come about today ? ' he asked You-shi ."
尤氏 答道 ： “ 倒 没 说 什么 ， 一 进来 脸上 倒 象 有些 个 恼意 似的 ， 及至 说了半天 话儿 ， 又 提起 媳妇 的 病 ， 他 倒 渐渐 的 气色 平和 了 。,"' Oh , ' said You-shi , ' nothing in particular . When she first came in she appeared to be upset about something or other , then after we would been talking for some time and I mentioned that Rong 's wife was ill , she gradually calmed down ."
你 又 叫 留 他 吃饭 ， 他 听见 媳妇 这样 的 病 ， 也 不好意思 只管 坐 着 ， 又 说 了 几句话 就 去 了 ， 倒 没有 求 什么 事 。,When you invited her to dinner she knew she could not very well stay on with sickness in the house and left after chatting a few minutes longer . She did not ask for anything before she went .
— — 如今 且说 媳妇 这 病 ， 你 那里 寻 一个 好 大夫 给 他 瞧瞧 要紧 ， 可 别 耽误 了 ！,"' But let is talk about that child is illness . The thing is , you really must find a good doctor to look at her , before it gets too late ."
现今 咱们 家 走 的 这 群 大夫 ， 那里 要 得 ！,This lot we have around the house at present are completely useless !
一个个 都 是 听 着 人 的 口气 儿 ， 人 怎么 说 ， 他 也 添 几句 文 话儿 说 一遍 ；,Each one of them just listens to what you say and then gives it back to you with a few learned words thrown in .
可倒 殷勤 的 很 ： 三四个 人 ， 一日 轮流 着 ， 倒有 四五遍 来看 脉 ！,"And they are so terribly conscientious about it ! We have three or four of them coming by turns every day , and sometimes they will take her pulse four or five times in the same day ."
大家 商量 着立 个 方儿 ， 吃 了 也 不 见效 。,Then they have long discussions while they decide on a prescription .
倒弄 的 一日 三五次 换 衣裳 、 坐下 起来 的 见 大夫 。 其实 于 病人 无益 。 ”,"None of the medicine does her any good , and the only consequence of all this is that she is having to change her clothes four or five times in a day and be constantly getting up and sitting down to see these doctors , which is no good at all for a person in her condition . '"
贾珍 道 ： “ 可是 这 孩子 也 糊涂 ， 何必 又 脱脱 换换 的 ， 倘或 又 着 了 凉 ， 更添 一层 病 ， 还 了得 ？,"' Oh , she is a silly child ! ' said Cousin Zhen . ' There is no need for all this dressing and undressing . Suppose she caught a chill on top of this other illness , that would be really frightful ."
任凭 什么 好 衣裳 ， 又 值 什么 呢 ， 孩子 的 身体 要紧 ， — — 就是 一天 穿 一套 新 的 ， 也 不值 什么 。,"Never mind about the clothes , for goodness ' sake , however good they are ! It is the child is health that matters . Who cares if she has to have a completely new outfit every day ? We can afford it ."
我 正要 告诉 你 ： 方才 冯紫英 来看 我 ， 他 见 我 有些 心里 烦 ， 问 我 怎么 了 ， 我 告诉 他 媳妇 身子 不大 爽快 ， 因为 不得 个 好 大夫 ， 断 不 透 是 喜 是 病 ， 又 不知 有 妨碍 没 妨碍 ， 所以 我 心里 实在 着急 。,"' What I was going to tell you is that I have just had a visit from Feng Zi-ying . He noticed that something was bothering me , and when he asked me what it was I explained that our daughter-in-law is not well and told him how worried we are because we haven ' t got a decent doctor who can tell us for sure whether it is pregnancy or disease , so that we do not even know how serious it is ."
冯紫英 因说 他 有 一个 幼时 从 学 的 先生 ， 姓张 名友 士 ， 学问 最 渊博 ， 更 兼 医理 极 精 ， 且 能断 人 的 生死 。,"Then Feng Zi-ying told me about a scholar friend of his called Zhang You-shi . Feng was taught by him as a boy . He is a man of very wide learning including , apparently , an excellent knowledge of medicine and the ability to tell with certainty whether a disease is curable or not ."
今年 是 上京 给 他 儿子 捐官 ， 现在 他 家住 着 呢 。,He is up at the capital this year to purchase a place for his son and is at present staying in Feng Zi-ying 's house .
这样 看来 ， 或者 媳妇 的 病 该 在 他 手里 除灾 ， 也 未 可定 。,It looks as if in his hands she might stand a good chance of getting better .
我 已 叫 人 拿 我 的 名帖 去 请 了 。,"Anyway , I have already sent someone round with my card and asked him to call ."
今日 天晚 ， 或 未必 来 ， 明日 想 一定 来 的 。,"It is getting a bit late for him to come today , but he should definitely be round tomorrow ."
— — 且 冯紫英 又 回家 亲替 我 求 他 ， 务必 请 他 来 瞧 的 。,Feng Zi-ying promised to see him when he got back and put in a word for me to make quite sure that he agrees to come .
等待 张 先生 来 瞧 了 再说 罢 。 ”,So we will just have to wait and see what this Dr Zhang says . '
尤氏 听说 ， 心中 甚 喜 ， 因说 ： “ 后日 是 太爷 的 寿日 ， 到底 怎么 个 办法 ？ ”,You-shi was delighted with this news . ' And what are we going to do about Father 's birthday ? ' she asked . ' It is the day after tomorrow . '
贾珍 说道 ： “ 我 方才 到 了 太爷 那里 去 请安 ， 兼请 太爷 来家 受 一 受 一家子 的 礼 。,"' I have just been out to see him , ' said Cousin Zhen , ' and I took the opportunity while I was there of asking him if he would come over on his birthday to receive everyone 's kowtows , but he refused ."
太爷 因 说道 ： ‘ 我 是 清净 惯 了 的 ， 我 不 愿意 往 你们 那 是非 场中 去 。,"He said , "" I have got used to the peace and quiet of the monastery and I am not willing to go back into your quarrelsome world again ."
你们 必定 说 是 我 的 生日 ， 要 叫 我 去 受 些 众人 的 头 ， 你 莫如 把 我 从前 注 的 《 阴鹭 文 》 给 我 好好 的 叫 人 写 出来 刻 了 ， 比 叫 我 无故 受 众人 的 头 还 强 百倍 呢 ！,"If you insist on celebrating my birthday it would be a hundred times better to have my tract on Divine Rewards written out by a good calligrapher and cut on blocks for printing than to drag me back to your house for a lot of senseless head-knocking . """
倘或 明日 后日 这 两天 一家子 要 来 ， 你 就 在 家里 好好 的 款待 他们 就是 了 。,"He said , "" If the family turn up tomorrow and the day after for my birthday , you can give them a party yourself ."
也 不必 给 我 送 什么 东西 来 。 连 你 后日 也 不必 来 。,"But do not go sending me any presents , "" he said , "" and do not come yourself !"
— — 你 要 心中 不安 ， 你 今日 就 给 我 磕 了 头 去 。,If it will set your mind at rest you can give me a kotow now and get it over with .
倘或 后日 你 又 跟 许多 人 来 闹 我 ， 我 必 和 你 不依 。 ’,"But if you come round here the day after tomorrow with a lot of other people to pester me , I shall refuse to see you . """
如此 说 了 ， 后日 我 是 再 不敢 去 的 了 。,"Well , after that I obviously can not go again on his birthday ."
且 叫赖 升来 ， 吩咐 他 预备 两日 的 筵席 。 ”,We would better have Lai Sheng in and make arrangements for two days ' entertainment . '
尤氏 因 叫 了 贾蓉 来 ： “ 吩咐 赖升 照例 预备 两日 的 筵席 ， 要 丰 丰富 富 的 。,"You-shi called in Jia Rong . ' Tell Lai Sheng to prepare the usual two-day party for Grandfather , ' she said . ' Say we want a really good spread ."
你 再 亲自 到 西府里 请 老太太 、 大 太太 、 二 太太 和 你 琏 二 婶子 来 逛逛 。,We shall be asking Lady Jia and Lady Xing and Lady Wang and your Auntie Lian from the other house : you can go round yourself to invite them .
你 父亲 今日 又 听见 一个 好 大夫 ， 已经 打发 人 请 去 了 ， 想 明日 必来 。,' And by the way : today your father heard of a good doctor and has already sent someone to ask him round . He should be coming tomorrow .
你 可 将 他 这些 日子 的 病症 细细的 告诉 他 。 ”,"When he does , you had better tell him exactly what your wife 's symptoms have been during the past few days . '"
贾蓉一一 答应 着 出去 了 。 正 遇 着 刚才 到 冯紫英 家 去 请 那 先生 的 小子 回来 了 ， 因 回道 ：,"Jia Rong promised to carry out his mother 's instructions and left the room , encountering , as he did so , the youth who had been sent to Feng Zi-ying 's house to request a call from the doctor . He had just got back from delivering his message and reported to Jia Rong as follows :"
“ 奴才 方才 到 了 冯大爷 家 ， 拿 了 老爷 名帖 请 那 先生 去 ， 那 先生 说 是 ： ‘ 方才 这里 大爷 也 和 我 说 了 ， 但 只 今日 拜 了 一天 的 客 ， 才 回到 家 ， 此时 精神 实在 不能 支持 ， 就是 去 到 府上 也 不能 看 脉 ， 须 得 调息 一夜 ， 明日 务必 到 府 。 ’,"' I took the Master 's card to the doctor at Mr Feng 's house and asked him to call . He said Mr Feng had already spoken to him about it , but he had been out visiting all day and only just got back and he simply did not have the energy to go out any more today . He said , "" Even if I were to go round to your house now I should not be able to take the young lady 's pulse . It would take me all night to get my breathing regulated . However , "" he said , "" I shall definitely call round tomorrow . """
他 又 说 ： ‘ 医学 浅薄 ， 本 不敢当 此 重荐 ， 因 冯大爷 和 府上 既 已 如此 说 了 ， 又 不得不 去 ， 你 先 替 我 回明 大人 就是 了 。,"And he said , "" My knowledge of medicine is really too slight for a consultation of this importance , but as your master and Mr Feng are so pressing , I obviously can not refuse . But I hope you will explain this to your master . """
大人 的 名帖 着实 不敢当 。 ’ 还 叫 奴才 拿 回来 了 。,"And he said , "" As for your master 's card , that is an honour I really can not accept "" ; and he made me bring it back ."
哥儿 替 奴才 回 一声 儿 罢 。 ”,"Will you please pass on this message for me , Master Rong ? '"
贾蓉复 转身 进去 ， 回 了 贾珍尤 氏 的话 ， 方 出来 叫 了 赖升 ， 吩咐 预备 两日 的 筵席 的话 。 赖升 答应 ， 自去 照例 料理 ， 不在话下 。,"Jia Rong turned and went back into the room to tell his parents . Going out once more , he summoned Lai Sheng and gave instructions for preparing a two-day birthday party , which Lai Sheng duly proceeded to put into operation . But of that no more ."
且说 次日 午间 ， 门上 人 回道 ： “ 请 的 那 张 先生 来 了 。 ”,"About noon next day one of the servants at the gate came in to report : ' The Dr Zhang you sent for has arrived , sir ."
贾珍遂 延入 大厅 坐下 ， 茶 毕 ， 方开言 道 ： “ 昨日 承 冯大爷 示知 老先生 人品 学问 ， 又 兼 深通 医学 ， 小弟 不胜 钦敬 。 ”,"Cousin Zhen went out to receive the doctor and conducted him into the main reception room , where they both sat down . He waited until the doctor had taken tea before broaching the subject of his visit . ' Yesterday Mr Feng was telling me about your great learning , ' said Cousin Zhen . ' 1 gather that it includes a profound knowledge of medicine . I assure you I was very much impressed . '"
张 先生 道 ： “ 晚生 粗鄙 下士 ， 知识 浅陋 。,"' I am only a very indifferent scholar , ' replied Dr Zhang , ' and my knowledge is really extremely superficial ."
昨 因 冯大爷 示知 ， 大 人家 第 谦恭下士 ， 又 承 呼唤 ， 不敢 违命 。,"However , Mr Feng was telling me yesterday of the courteous and considerate patronage of scholars which is traditional in your family , so when I received your summons I felt unable to refuse ."
但 毫无 实学 ， 倍增 汗颜 。 ”,"I must insist , though , that I am entirely lacking in real learning and am acutely embarrassed to think that this will all too soon become apparent . '"
贾珍 道 ： “ 先生 不必 过谦 ， 就 请 先生 进去 看看 儿妇 ， 仰仗 高明 ， 以 释 下怀 。 ”,"' My dear sir you are altogether too modest , ' said Cousin Zhen . ' Do you think I could ask you to go in now and have a look at my daughter-in-law ? We are relying on your superior knowledge to put us out of our uncertainty . '"
于是 贾蓉 同 了 进去 ， 到 了 内室 ， 见 了 秦氏 ， 向 贾蓉 说道 ： “ 这 就是 尊夫人 了 ？ ”,"He left the doctor in the charge of Jia Rong , who conducted him through the inner part of the house to his own apartment , where Qin-shi was . ' Is this the lady ? ' asked the doctor ."
贾蓉 道 ： “ 正是 。,"' Yes , this is my wife , ' Jia Rong replied ."
请 先生 坐下 ， 让 我 把 贱内 的 病症 说一说 再 看 脉 如何 ？ ”,"' Do sit down ! I expect you would like me to describe her symptoms first , before you take the pulse ? '"
那 先生 道 ： “ 依小弟 意 下 ， 竟先 看 脉 ， 再 请教 病源 为 是 。,"' If you will permit me , no , ' said the doctor . ' I think it would be better if I took the pulse first and asked you about the development of the illness afterwards ."
我 初造 尊府 ， 本 也 不 知道 什么 ， 但 我们 冯大爷 务必 叫 小弟 过来 看看 ， 小弟 所以 不得不 来 。 如今 看 了 脉息 ， 看 小弟 说 得 是不是 ， 再 将 这些 日子 的 病势 讲 一 讲 ， 大家 斟酌 一个 方儿 。,"This is the first time I have been to your house , and as I am not a skilled practitioner and have only come here at our friend Mr Feng is insistence , I think I should take the pulse and give you my diagnosis first . We can go on to talk about her symptoms and discuss a course of treatment if you are satisfied with the diagnosis ."
可用 不可 用 ， 那时 大爷 再 定夺 就是 了 。 ”,"And of course , it will still be up to you to decide whether or not the treatment I prescribe is to be followed . '"
贾蓉 道 ： “ 先生 实在 高明 ， 如今 恨 相见 之晚 。,"' You speak with real authority , doctor , ' said Jia Rong . ' I only wish we had got to hear of you earlier ."
就 请 先生 看一看 脉息 可治 不可 治 ， 得以 使家 父母 放心 。 ”,"Take her pulse now , then , and let us know whether what she has can be cured , so that my parents may be spared further anxiety . '"
于是 家下 媳妇 们 ， 捧 过 大 迎 枕 来 ， 一面 给 秦氏 靠着 ， 一面 拉 着 袖口 ， 露出 手腕 来 。,"At this point Qin-shi 's women carried in a large arm-rest of the kind used in consultations , propped her forward with her arms across it , and drew back her sleeves , exposing both arms at the wrist ."
这 先生 方 伸手 按 在 右手 脉 上 ， 调息 了至 数 ， 凝神 细诊 了 半刻 工夫 。 换 过 左手 ， 亦复如是 。,"The doctor stretched out his hand and laid it on her right wrist , then , having first regulated his own breathing in order to be able to count the rate , he felt the pulses with great concentration for the space of several minutes , after which he transferred to the left wrist and spent an equal amount of time on that ."
诊毕 了 ， 说道 ： “ 我们 外边 坐 罢 。 ”,"This done , he proposed that they should withdraw to the outside room to talk ."
贾蓉 于是 同 先生 到 外边 屋里 炕上 坐 了 。,Jia Rong accompanied him outside and sat with him on the kang .
一个 婆子 端 了 茶 来 ， 贾蓉 道 ： “ 先生 请 茶 。 ”,"An old woman served tea , which Jia Rong invited the doctor to take , waiting until he had done so before asking him for his diagnosis ."
茶 毕 ， 问道 ： “ 先生 看 这 脉息 还 治得 治 不得 ？ ”,"' Tell me , doctor , from your reading of my wife 's pulse , do you think she can be cured ? '"
先生 道 ： “ 看 得 尊夫人 脉息 ： 左寸 沉数 ， 左 关沉伏 ；,"' Well , the lower left distal pulse is rapid and the lower left median pulse is strong and full , ' said the doctor ."
右寸 细 而 无力 ， 右关 虚而无神 。,"' On the right side , the distal pulse is thin and lacks strength and the median pulse is faint and lacks vitality ."
其 左寸 沉数 者 ， 乃心 气虚 而 生火 ；,"' Now , a rapid lower left-hand distal pulse means that a malfunction of the controlling humour of the heart is causing it to generate too much fire ;"
左 关沉伏 者 ， 乃 肝家 气滞 血亏 。,"and the strong lower median pulse means that the liver 's humour is blocked , giving rise to a deficiency of blood ."
右寸 细 而 无力 者 ， 乃 肺 经气 分 太虚 ；,"A thin , weak distal pulse on the right side indicates a gross deficiency of humour in the lungs ;"
右关 虚而无神 者 ， 乃 脾土 被 肝木 克制 。,and a faint right median pulse lacking in vitality shows that the earth of the spleen is being subdued by the woody element of the liver .
心 气虚 而 生火 者 ， 应 现今 经期 不 调 ， 夜间 不寐 。,"' If the heart is generating fire , the symptoms should be irregularity of the menses and insomnia ."
肝家 血亏 气滞 者 ， 应胁 下 痛胀 ， 月 信 过期 ， 心中 发热 。,"A deficiency of blood and blockage of humour in the liver would result in pain and congestion under the ribs , delay of the menses beyond their term , and burning sensations in the heart ."
肺 经气 分 太虚 者 ， 头目 不时 眩晕 ， 寅卯间 必然 自汗 ， 如 坐 舟 中 。,"A deficiency of humour in the lungs would give rise to sudden attacks of giddiness , sweating at five or six in the morning , and a sinking feeling rather like the feeling you get in a pitching boat ."
脾土 被 肝木 克制 者 ， 必定 不思 饮食 ， 精神 倦怠 ， 四肢 酸软 。,"And if the earth of the spleen is being subdued by the wood of the liven she would undoubtedly experience loss of appetite , lassitude , and general enfeeblement of the whole body ."
— — 据 我 看 这 脉 ， 当 有 这些 症候 才 对 。,"If my reading of the lady 's pulse is correct , she ought to be showing all these symptoms ."
或 以 这个 的 为 喜脉 ， 则 小弟 不敢 闻 命 矣 。 ”,"Some people would tell you they indicated a pregnancy , but I am afraid I should have to disagree . '"
旁边 一个 贴身 伏侍 的 婆子 道 ： “ 何尝 不是 这样 呢 ！,"' You must have second sight , doctor ! ' said one of the old women , a body-servant of Qin-shi 's who was standing by ."
真正 先生 说 得 如神 ， 倒 不用 我们 说 了 。,' What you have said exactly describes how it is with her ; there is no need for us to tell you anything more .
如今 我们 家里 现有 好几位 太医 老爷 瞧 着 呢 ！ 都 不能 说 得 这样 真切 。,Of all the doctors we have lately had around here to look at her none has ever spoken as much to the point as this .
有 的 说道 是 喜 ， 有 的 说道 是 病 ；,Some have said she is expecting ; others have said it is illness ;
这位 说 不相干 ， 这位 又 说 怕 冬至 前后 ： 总 没有 个 真 著 话儿 。,one says it is not serious ; another only gives her till the winter solstice ; not one of them tells you anything you can really rely on .
求 老爷 明白 指示 指示 。 ”,"Please doctor , you tell us : just how serious s this illness ? '"
那 先生 说 ： “ 大 奶奶 这个 症候 ， 可是 众位 耽搁 了 ！,"' I am afraid my colleagues have allowed your mistress 's condition to deteriorate , ' said the doctor ."
要 在 初次 行经 的 时候 就 用药 治起 ， 只怕 此时 已 全愈 了 。,"' If she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning , when she first started her courses , there is every reason to suppose that she would by now be completely cured ."
如今 既是 把 病 耽误到 这 地位 ， 也 是 应有 此 灾 。,"But the illness has been neglected for so long now , this breakdown was almost bound to happen ."
依我看 起来 ， 病倒 尚有 三分 治得 。,I would say that with proper treatment she has about a one in three chance of recovery .
吃 了 我 这 药 看 ， 若 是 夜间 睡 的 着觉 ， 那时 又 添 了 二分 拿手 了 。,"We shall just have to see how she responds to my medicine . If , after taking it , she can get a good night 's sleep , her chances will be distinctly better : say fifty-fifty ."
据 我 看 这 脉息 ， 大 奶奶 是 个 心性 高强 、 聪明 不过 的 人 ；,"' From my reading of her pulse , I should expect your mistress to be a very highly strung , sensitive young woman ."
但 聪明 太 过 ， 则 不如意 事 常有 ； 不如意 事 常有 ， 则 思虑 太 过 ：,"Sometimes , when people are over-sensitive , they find a good deal that is upsetting in what goes on around them ; and of course , if things are upsetting them , they will tend to worry a lot ."
此病 是 忧虑 伤 脾 ， 肝木 忒 旺 ， 经血 所以 不能 按时 而至 。,"This illness has been caused by too much worry affecting the spleen and causing an excess of wood in the liver , with the result that the menstrual blood has been prevented from flowing at the proper times ."
大 奶奶 从前 行经 的 日子 问一问 ， 断 不是 常缩 ， 必是 常长 的 。 是不是 ？ ”,"If we were to ask your mistress about the dates of her courses , I am sure we should find that they tended to be on the late side , is not that so ? '"
这 婆子 答道 ： “ 可不是 ！,"' Absolutely right , ' the old woman replied ."
从 没有 缩过 ， 或是 长 两日 三日 ， 以至 十日 不等 ， 都 长 过 的 。 ”,"' Her periods have never been early . Sometimes two or three days late , sometimes as much as ten days : but in any case , always late . '"
先生 听 道 ： “ 是 了 ， 这 就是 病源 了 。,' You see ! ' said the doctor . ' There is the cause of the trouble .
从前 若 能以 养心 调气 之 药服 之 ， 何至于此 ！,"If she could have been treated in time with something to fortify the heart and stabilize the humours , she would never have got into this present state ."
这 如今 明显 出 一个 水亏 火旺 的 症候 来 。,"What we have now , I am afraid , is an advanced case of dehydration ."
— — 待 我 用药 看 。 ”,"Well , we shall have to see what my medicine can do for her . '"
于是 写 了 方子 ， 递 与 贾蓉 ， 上写 的 是 ：,He wrote out the following prescription and handed it to Jia Rong :
益气 养荣 补 脾 和 肝汤,"For a decoction to increase the breath , nourish the heart , fortify the spleen and calm the liver"
人参 二 钱,Ginseng 2 drams

贾蓉 看 了 说 ： “ 高明 的 很 。 还要 请教 先生 ： 这病 与 性命 终久 有妨 无妨 ？ ”,"' Most impressive ! ' said Jia Rong , glancing at the prescription . ' Tell me , though , doctor : just how serious is this illness ? Is her life in danger ? '"
先生 笑 道 ： “ 大爷 是 最高 明 的 人 ： 人病 到 这个 地位 ， 非 一朝一夕 的 症候 了 ；,"The doctor smiled . ' You are an intelligent young man , Mr Jia . When an illness has reached this stage , it is not going to be cured in an afternoon ."
吃 了 这 药 ， 也 要 看 医缘 了 。,We must see how she responds to medication .
依小弟 看来 ， 今年 一 冬 是 不相干 的 ； 总是 过 了 春分 ， 就 可望 全愈 了 。 ”,"As I see it , there is no real danger this winter . I should say that if she can get past the spring equinox , you could look forward to a complete recovery . '"
贾蓉 也 是 个 聪明人 ， 也 不往 下 细问 了 。,Jia Rong was intelligent enough to understand the real import of what the doctor was telling him and did not question him further .
于是 贾蓉送 了 先生 去 了 ， 方将 这 药方子 并 脉案 都 给 贾珍 看 了 ， 说 的话 也 都 回 了 贾珍 并 尤氏 了 。,"Having first seen him out , he went in to show the prescription and written summary of the diagnosis to Cousin Zhen and gave both his parents a full account of what the doctor had said ."
尤氏 向贾珍 道 ： “ 从来 大夫 不象 他 说 的 痛快 ， 想必 用药 不错 的 。 ”,"' No other doctor has ever spoken so convincingly , ' said You-shi , turning to Cousin Zhen . ' I am sure his medicine will do her good . '"
贾珍笑 道 ： “ 他 原 不是 那 等 混饭吃 久 惯 行医 的 人 ；,"Cousin Zhen smiled complacently . ' This man is no medical hack practising for a living , ' he said ."
因为 冯紫英 我们 相好 ， 他 好容易 求 了 他 来 的 。,' It is only because Feng Zi-ying is such a good friend of mine that he could be persuaded to come and see us .
既有 了 这个 人 ， 媳妇 的 病 或者 就 能 好 了 。,Perhaps with a man like this treating her our daughter-in-law stands some chance of getting better .
他 那 方子 上 有 人参 ， 就 用 前日 买 的 那 一斤 好 的 罢 。 ”,"I see there is ginseng in that prescription , by the way . You can use some of that pound of high-grade ginseng we bought the other day '"
贾蓉 听毕 了 话 ， 方 出来 叫 人 抓药 去 煎 给 秦氏 吃 。,"Seeing that they had no more to say , Jia Rong went out and ordered the drugs for Qin-shi 's medicine to be purchased and prepared ."
不知 秦氏 服 了 此 药 ， 病势 如何 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,But you will have to read the next chapter if you want to know what effect the medicine had on her when she had taken it .
第十一回,Chapter 11
庆 寿辰 宁府 排 家宴,Ning-guo House celebrates the birthday of an absent member
见熙 凤贾瑞 起 淫心,And Jia Rui conceives an illicit passion for his attractive cousin
话 说 是 日 贾敬 的 寿辰 ， 贾珍先 将 上 等 可 吃 的 东西 ， 稀奇 的 果品 ， 装 了 十六大 捧 盒 ， 着 贾蓉 带领 家下 人 送与 贾敬 去 ， 向 贾蓉 说道 ：,Jia Jing 's birthday had now arrived . Cousin Zhen packed sixteen lacquer gift-boxes with the rarest and choicest delicacies and instructed Jia Rong to take a number of domestics with him and deliver them to Jia Jing .
“ 你 留神 看 太爷 喜欢 不 喜欢 ， 你 就行了 礼 起来 ， 说 ： ‘ 父亲 遵 太爷 的话 ， 不敢 前来 ， 在 家里 率领 合家 都 朝 上行 了礼 了 。 ’ ”,"He was to observe carefully whether or not his grandfather was pleased , and having made his kotow , was to deliver the following message : ' Because of your request , Father has not ventured to visit you himself . Instead he will place himself at the head of the entire family and lead them in prostrating themselves in your direction . '"
贾蓉 听罢 ， 即 率领 家人 去 了 。,"Having received his father 's instructions , Jia Rong mustered his band of servants and set out ."
这里 渐渐 的 就 有人 来 。,Back at home visitors gradually began to arrive .
先是 贾琏 、 贾蔷 来看 了 各处 的 座位 ， 并 问 ： “ 有 什么 玩意儿 没有 ？ ”,"Jia Lian and Jia Qiang were the first . Having inspected the various seating arrangements , they inquired whether there was to be entertainment of some kind ."
家人 答道 ： “ 我们 爷 算计 ， 本来 请 太爷 今日 来家 ， 所以 并未 敢 预备 玩意儿 。,"' The Master had originally been reckoning on old Sir Jing coming here today , ' said one of the servants , so he did not arrange for any entertainment ."
前日 听见 太爷 不来 了 ， 现 叫 奴才 们 找 了 一班 小戏 儿 并 一档子 打 十番 的 ， 都 在 园子 里 戏台 上 预备 着 呢 。 ”,"But the day before yesterday he learned that Sir Jing would not be coming , so he asked us to find a troupe of actors and a band . They are at present on the stage in the garden getting ready for the performance . '"
次后 邢夫人 、 王夫人 、 凤姐儿 、 宝玉 都 来 了 ， 贾珍 并 尤氏 接 了 进去 。,"Lady Xing , Lady Wang , Wang Xi-feng and Bao-yu arrived next and were welcomed and conducted inside by Cousin Zhen and You-shi ."
尤氏 的 母亲 已先 在 这里 ， 大家 见 过 了 ， 彼此 让 了 坐 。 贾珍尤 氏 二人 递 了 茶 ， 因 笑 道 ：,"You-shi 's mother was already there . She was introduced to the new arrivals , who were then invited to sit down and were served by Cousin Zhen and You-shi with tea ."
“ 老太太 原 是 个 老祖宗 ， 我 父亲 又 是 侄儿 ， 这样 年纪 ， 这个 日子 ， 原 不敢 请 他 老人家 来 ；,"' We realize , ' said Cousin Zhen , ' that Lady Jia is a generation older than Father . Father is only her nephew , of course , and strictly speaking it was not correct form to invite a person of her age at all ."
但是 这时候 ， 天气 又 凉爽 ， 满园 的 菊花 盛开 ， 请 老祖宗 过来 散 散闷 ， 看看 众 儿孙 热热闹闹 的 ， 是 这个 意思 。,"Nevertheless , since the weather is so fresh and nice just now and the chrysanthemums in the garden at their best , we had rather hoped that she might enjoy coming over for a bit and having all her children and grandchildren around her . That was our only motive in asking her ."
— — 谁知 老祖宗 又 不 赏脸 。 ”,I am sorry she decided not to honour us . '
凤姐儿 未 等 王夫人 开口 ， 先 说道 ： “ 老太太 昨日 还 说 要 来 呢 ， 因为 晚上 看见 宝兄弟 吃 桃儿 ， 他 老人家 又 嘴馋 ， 吃 了 有 大半个 ， 五更天 时候 就 一连 起来 两次 ， 今日 早晨 略 觉 身子 倦 些 ； 因 叫 我 回 大爷 ， 今日 断 不能 来 了 ， 说 有 好吃 的 要 几样 ， 还要 很烂 的 呢 。 ”,"' Up to yesterday , ' Xi-feng put in hurriedly , not waiting for Lady Wang to reply , ' Grandmother had been intending to come . Then yesterday evening she saw Bao-yu eating some peaches and the greedy old thing could not resist trying one herself . She only ate about two thirds of a peach , but she had to get up twice running in the early hours , and this morning she still felt rather poorly and told me to tell you that she definitely would not be able to come . But she said that if you have any specially nice things to eat she would like one or two kinds to try ; only they must be soft and easy to digest . '"
贾珍 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 我 说 老祖宗 是 爱 热闹 的 ， 今日 不 来 ， 必定 有个 缘故 。 — — 这 就是 了 。 ”,"Cousin Zhen smiled with pleasure . ' Well , that is all right then . Knowing how much Grandma enjoys a bit of fun , I thought it did not seem like her not to come today unless she had some good reason for not coming . '"
王夫人 说 ： “ 前日 听见 你 大 妹妹 说 ， 蓉 哥 媳妇 身上 有些 不大好 ， 到底 是 怎么样 ？ ”,"' The other day Xi-feng was telling us that Rong 's wife is not very well , ' said Lady Wang . ' What exactly is wrong with her ? '"
尤氏 道 ： “ 他 这个 病得 的 也 奇 。,"' It is a very puzzling illness , ' You-shi replied ."
上 月 中秋 还跟着 老太太 、 太太 玩 了 半夜 ， 回家 来 好好 的 。,"' At Mid-Autumn last month , when she got back from playing cards half the night with you and Lady Jia , she seemed perfectly all right ."
到 了 二十日 以后 ， 一日 比 一日 觉懒 了 ， 又 懒怠 吃 东西 ： 这 将近 有 半个 多月 。 经期 又 有 两个 月 没来 。 ”,"But from the twentieth onwards she seemed to get more and more tired and listless every day - too tired even to eat . She is been like that for more than a fortnight now , and it is two months since she had a period . '"
— — 邢夫人 接着 说道 ： “ 不要 是 喜 罢 ？ ”,' Could not she be expecting ? ' said Lady Xing .
正说 着 ， 外头 人 回道 ： “ 大老爷 、 二 老爷 并 一家 的 爷们 都 来 了 ， 在 厅 上 呢 。 ”,"They were interrupted by a servant from outside : ' Sir She and Sir Zheng and all the other gentlemen have arrived , sir . They are in the main reception room . '"
贾珍 连忙 出去 了 。,Cousin Zhen hurried out .
这里 尤氏复 说 ： “ 从前 大夫 也 有 说 是 喜 的 ， 昨日 冯紫英 荐 了 他 幼时 从 学过 的 一个 先生 ， 医道 很 好 ， 瞧 了 说 不是 喜 ， 是 一个 大 症候 。,"' To begin with that is what some of the doctors told us , ' said You-shi , resuming the conversation ; ' but yesterday Feng Zi-ying introduced a doctor friend of his to us who is terribly good , someone he studied with , and he said that she was not expecting at all . He said she was suffering from a serious illness ."
昨日 开 了 方子 ， 吃 了 一剂 药 ， 今日 头晕 的 略 好些 ， 别的 仍 不见 大 效 。 ”,"He wrote a prescription for her yesterday and she has already had one dose of the medicine . Today her giddiness is a bit better , but everything else is still pretty much the same . '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 我 说 他 不是 十分 支持不住 ， 今日 这样 日子 ， 再也 不肯 不 挣扎 着 上来 。 ”,"' There ! ' said Xi-feng . ' I thought it must be something quite serious to keep her away , especially on a day like this . I know she would have forced herself to come if she could have done . '"
尤氏 道 ： “ 你 是 初三 日 在 这里 见 他 的 ， 他 强 扎挣 了 半天 ， 也 是 因 你们 娘儿 两个 好 的 上头 ， 还 恋恋 的 舍不得 去 。 ”,"' You remember you saw her here on the third , ' said You-shi . ' She had a terrible struggle to keep going on that occasion . It was only because the two of you have always been so close and she did not want to miss you that she made the effort . '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 眼圈儿 红 了 一会 子 ， 方 说道 ： “ ‘ 天有不测风云 ， 人有旦夕祸福 。 ’ 这点 年纪 ， 倘或 因 这 病 上 有个 长短 ， 人生在世 ， 还有 什么 趣儿 呢 ！ ”,"Xi-feng 's eyes became moist and for a moment she was too overcome to speak . ' I know "" the weather and human life are both unpredictable "" , ' she said at last , ' but she is only a child still . If anything should happen to her as a result of this illness , I think all the fun would go out of life ! '"
正说 着 ， 贾蓉 进来 ， 给 邢夫人 、 王夫人 、 凤姐儿 都 请 了 安 ， 方 回 尤氏 道 ：,"While she was speaking Jia Rong came in , and having greeted in turn first Lady Xing , then Lady Wang , and then Xi-feng , he turned to his mother :"
“ 方才 我 给 太爷 送 吃食 去 ， 并说 我 父亲 在家 伺候 老爷 们 ， 款待 一家子 爷们 ， 遵 太爷 话 ， 并 不敢 来 。,"' I have just delivered the food to Grandfather , and I told him that Father was entertaining all the men of the family at home and had not presumed to visit him because of what he said ."
太爷 听 了 很 喜欢 ， 说 ： ‘ 这 才 是 。 ’,"Grandfather was very pleased . He said "" That is exactly as it should be . """
叫 告诉 父亲 母亲 ， 好生 伺候 太爷 太太 们 。 叫 我 好生 伺候 叔叔 婶子 并 哥哥 们 。,"He said I was to tell you and Father to see that my great-uncles and great-aunts are properly looked after , and he told me that I was to look after my uncles and aunts and cousins ."
还 说 ： ‘ 那 《 阴鹭 文 》 叫 他们 急急 刻 出来 ， 印 一万张 散人 。 ’,He also said he wanted the blocks for Divine Rewards to be cut as quickly as possible and ten thousand copies printed for free distribution . I have already given this message to Father .
我 将 这话 都 回 了 我 父亲 了 。 我 这 会子 还 得 快 出去 打发 太爷 们 并 合家 爷们 吃饭 。 ”,Now I have got to hurry off again to look after the gentlemen while they have their dinner . '
凤姐儿 说 ： “ 蓉 哥儿 ， 你 且 站 着 。,"' Rong , just a moment ! ' said Xi-feng as he was going ."
你 媳妇 今日 到底 是 怎么着 ？ ”,' How is it really with your wife ? '
贾蓉皱 皱眉 儿 说道 ： “ 不好 呢 ！ 婶子 回来 瞧瞧 去 就 知道 了 。 ”,"Jia Rong is brows contracted in a worried frown . ' She is not at all well , Auntie . You will know what I mean when you see her presently . '"
于是 贾蓉 出去 了 。,He left without saying any more .
这里 尤氏 向 邢夫人 王夫人 道 ： “ 太太 们 在 这里 吃饭 ， 还是 在 园子 里 吃 去 ？,"' Well , ladies ! ' said You-shi . ' Will you have dinner in here , or shall we eat in the garden ?"
有 小戏 儿 现在 园子 里 预备 着 呢 。 ”,There are some actors in the garden preparing an entertainment . '
王夫人 向 邢夫人 道 ： “ 这里 很 好 。 ”,"' In here would be all right , would not it ? ' said Lady Wang with a glance in Lady Xing 's direction ."
尤氏 就 吩咐 媳妇 婆子 们 ： “ 快 摆 饭 来 。 ”,You-shi at once gave orders to her women to serve .
门外 一齐 答应 了 一声 ， 都 各人 端 各人 的 去 了 。,There was an answering cry from outside the door and a great flurry of domestics each bustling about her own contribution to the meal .
不多时 ， 摆上 了 饭 。,In no time at all the table was laid and dinner ready .
尤氏 让 邢夫人 王夫人 并 他 母亲 都 上坐 了 ， 他 与 凤姐儿 宝玉 侧席 坐 了 。,"You-shi made Lady Xing and Lady Wang sit at the head with her mother , while she , Xi-feng and Bao-yu sat at the two sides ."
邢夫人 王夫人 道 ： “ 我们 来 原为 给 大老爷 拜寿 ， 这 岂不是 我们 来 过生日 来 了 么 ？ ”,"Lady Xing and Lady Wang politely protested that they had come to offer birthday felicitations , not to eat a birthday feast ."
凤姐儿 说 ： “ 大老爷 原是 好 养静 的 ， 已 修炼 成 了 ， 也 算 得 是 神仙 了 。,"' Yes , ' said Xi-feng . ' After all these years of spiritual self-improvement , Uncle must by now be practically an Immortal ."
太太 们 这么 一 说 ， 就 叫作 ‘ 心到神知 ’ 了 。 ”,"And with Immortals , as we all know , "" it is the thought that counts and not the ceremony "" . '"
一句 话 说 得 满屋子 里 笑 起来 。,The others all laughed .
尤氏 的 母亲 并 邢夫人 、 王夫人 、 凤姐儿 都 吃了饭 ， 漱 了 口 、 净 了 手 ； 才 说 要 往 园子 里 去 ， 贾蓉 进来 向 尤氏 道 ： “ 老爷 们 并 各位 叔叔 哥哥 们 都 吃了饭 了 。,"You-shi 's mother , Lady Xing , Lady Wang and Xi-feng , having finished their meal , rinsed out their mouths and washed their hands , had just announced their intention of going into the garden , when Jia Rong came in with a message for his mother . ' My great-uncles and all the other gentlemen have just finished their dinner ."
大老爷 说 家里 有事 ， 二 老爷 是 不 爱 听戏 又 怕人 闹 的 慌 ， 都 去 了 。 别的 一家子 爷们 被 琏 二叔 并 蔷 大爷 都 让 过去 听戏 去 了 。,"Greatuncle She says he has business at home , and Great-uncle Zheng does not like plays because he says he can not stand the noise ; but all the others have gone with Uncle Lian and Cousin Qiang to watch the players ."
方才 南 安郡王 、 东 平郡王 、 西宁 郡王 、 北静郡王 四家 王爷 ， 并 镇国 公牛 府 等 六家 ， 忠 靖侯史 府 等 八家 ， 都 差 人 持 名帖 送 寿礼 来 ， 俱 回 了 我 父亲 ， 收 在 账房 里 ， 礼单 都 上 了 档子 了 ， 领谢 名帖 都 交给 各家 的 来 人 了 ， 来 人 也 各 照例 赏 过 ， 都 让 吃了饭 去 了 。,"' People have come with cards and birthday presents from the Prince of Nan-an , the Prince of Dong-ping , the Prince of Xi-ning , the Prince of Bei-jing , Duke Niu of Zhenguo and five other dukes , and Marquis of Zhong-jing and seven other marquises . The presents have all been received at the counting-house . They have been entered in the giftbook , and the people who brought them have been issued with thank-you cards . They have also been tipped the usual amounts and given a meal before leaving ."
母亲 该 请 二位 太太 、 老娘 、 婶子 都 过 园子 里 去 坐 着 罢 。 ”,' And Father says will you please bring the great-aunts and Grandmother You and Auntie Feng to the garden now . '
尤氏 道 ： “ 这里 也 是 才 吃 完 了 饭 ， 就要 过去 了 。 ”,"' Yes , we have finished too , ' said You-shi . ' We were about to come over when you arrived . '"
凤姐儿 说道 ： “ 我 回 太太 ： 我 先 瞧瞧 蓉 哥 媳妇儿 去 ， 我 再 过去 罢 。 ”,"' Aunt Wang , ' said Xi-feng , ' may I go and see Rong 's wife first ? I can go on to the garden from there ."
王夫人 道 ： “ 很 是 。,"' Certainly . You ought to go , ' said Lady Wang ."
我们 都 要 去 瞧瞧 ， 倒 怕 他 嫌 我们 闹 的 慌 。,"' In fact , we should all like to go with you , but I am afraid it would be too much excitement for her ."
说 我们 问 他 好 罢 。 ”,Please give her our love . '
尤氏 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 媳妇 听 你 的话 ， 你 去 开导 开导 他 ， 我 也 放心 。,"' My dear , said You-shi , ' I know she will always do anything you ask her to . See if you can talk her into a more cheerful frame of mind . It would be such a relief to me if you could ."
你 就 快 些 过 园子 里来 罢 。 ”,But join us in the garden as soon as you can ! '
宝玉 也 要 跟着 凤姐儿 去 瞧 秦氏 ， 王夫人 道 ： “ 你 看看 就 过来 罢 ， 那 是 侄儿 媳妇 呢 。 ”,"Bao-yu asked if he could go with Xi-feng to see Qin-shi . ' Yes , ' said Lady Wang . ' She is your nephew is wife . I think you should . Just look in for a moment , though , and then join the rest of us . '"
于是 尤氏 请 了 王夫人 邢夫人 并 他 母亲 都 过会芳 园 去 了 。 凤姐儿 宝玉 方 和 贾蓉 到 秦氏 这边 来 。,"Thereupon You-shi invited Lady Wang , Lady Xing and old Mrs You to accompany her to the All-scents Garden , while Xi-feng and Bao-yu accompanied Jia Rong to Qin-shi 's room ."
进 了 房门 ， 悄悄的 走 到 里间 房内 ， 秦氏 见 了 要 站 起来 ， 凤姐儿 说 ： “ 快 别 起来 ， 看 头晕 。 ”,"Entering the door of the apartment , they tiptoed softly into the inner room . As soon as she saw them , Qin-shi attempted to rise , but Xi-feng would not let her . ' No , no , do not get up ! ' she said . ' You will make yourself giddy . '"
于是 凤姐儿 紧行 了 两步 ， 拉住 了 秦氏 的 手 ， 说道 ： “ 我 的 奶奶 ！,In two rapid strides she was at her side and holding her by the hand . ' My dearest child !
怎么 几日 不见 ， 就 瘦 的 这样 了 ！ ”,"It is only a few days since last I saw you , but look how thin you have grown ! '"
于是 就 坐在 秦氏 坐 的 褥子 上 。,She sat down beside her on the quilt on which she sat propped .
宝玉 也 问 了 好 ， 在 对面 椅子 上 坐 了 。,"Bao-yu , after greeting her , sat in a chair opposite ."
贾蓉 叫 ： “ 快 倒 茶 来 ， 婶子 和 二叔 在 上房 还 未 吃 茶 呢 。 ”,"' Pour out some tea , ' said Jia Rong . ' Auntie Feng and Uncle Bao did not get any after their dinner . '"
秦氏 拉 着 凤姐儿 的 手 ， 强笑道 ： “ 这 都 是 我 没福 ：,"Qin-shi grasped Xi-feng 's hand and forced a smile to her wan face . ' It looks as though I was not meant to be happy , Auntie ! ' she said ."
这样 人家 ， 公公 婆婆 当 自家 的 女孩儿 似的 待 。,' This is such a lovely family to have married into . Rong 's parents treat me as if I were their own daughter .
婶娘 ， 你 侄儿 虽说 年轻 ， 却是 他 敬 我 ， 我 敬 他 ， 从来 没有 红 过 脸儿 。,"Rong may be young , but he respects me , and I respect him ; there has never been a cross word between us ."
就是 一家子 的 长辈 同辈 之中 ， 除了 婶子 不用说 了 ， 别人 也 从 无不 疼 我 的 ， 也 从 无不 和 我 好 的 。,"You , it goes without saying - but not only you , all the older members of the family - have always been goodness itself to me ."
如今 得 了 这个 病 ， 把 我 那 要 强心 一分 也 没有 。,I did so want to be worthy of all this kindness . But now this wretched illness has come along and taken away the chance .
公婆 面前 未 得 孝顺 一天 ； 婶娘 这样 疼 我 ， 我 就 有 十分 孝顺 的 心 ， 如今 也 不 能够 了 ！,"Now I shall never be able to be a good daughter to Rong 's parents ; and however badly I want to , I shall never be able to repay any of the love you have shown me ."
我 自 想着 ， 未必 熬 得 过年 去 。 ”,"I have a feeling inside me , Auntie : I do not think I am going to last the year out . '"
宝玉 正 把 眼瞅 着 那 “ 海棠 春 睡 图 ” 并 那 秦太虚 写 的 “ 嫩寒 锁 梦 因 春 冷 ， 芳气 袭 人 是 酒香 ” 的 对联 ， 不觉 想起 在 这里 睡 晌 觉 时 梦 到 “ 太虚幻境 ” 的 事 来 。,"Bao-yu had been studying the ' Spring Slumber ' painting on Qin-shi 's wall all this time and re-reading the couplet by Qin Guan on the scrolls at each side of it : The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in Q wintry dream ; The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents . As he did so , the memory returned of that earlier afternoon when he had slept in that very same room and dreamed about the Land of Illusion ."
正在 出神 ， 听 得 秦氏 说 了 这些 话 ， 如 万箭攒心 ， 那 眼泪 不觉 流下来 了 。,He was musing on the contents of that dream when he suddenly became aware of the words that Qin-shi was saying . They pierced his heart like the points of a thousand arrows . Great tears welled up in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks .
凤姐儿 见 了 ， 心中 十分 难过 ； 但 恐 病人 见 了 这个 样子 反添 心酸 ， 倒 不是 来 开导 他 的 意思 了 ， 因说 ： “ 宝玉 ， 你 忒 婆婆妈妈 的 了 。,"Xi-feng , seeing him , was herself deeply affected ; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make Qin-shi even more distressed , whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up , she rallied him lightly on his tears . ' Do not be such a baby , Bao-yu !"
他 病人 不过 是 这样 说 ， 那里 就 到 这个 田地 ？,It is not really that serious : sick people always say things like that .
况且 年纪 又 不大 ， 略病 病儿 就 好 了 。 ”,"Besides , she is still young , and when you are young you can shake an illness off in no time at all ."
又 回向 秦氏 道 ： “ 你 别 胡思乱想 ， 岂不是 自己 添病 了 么 ？ ”,"- You must not let yourself think such stupid things , ' she said , turning to Qin-shi . ' You will make yourself worse . '"
贾蓉 道 ： “ 他 这病 也 不用 别的 ， 只 吃得下 些 饭食 就 不怕 了 。 ”,' If only she could get a bit of food inside her . ' said Jia Rong . ' That is her real trouble : she will not eat anything . '
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 宝兄弟 ， 太太 叫 你 快些 过去 呢 。 你 倒别 在 这里 只管 这么着 ， 倒 招得 媳妇 也 心里 不好过 ； 太太 那里 又 惦着 你 。 ”,"' Bao , said Xi-feng , your mother told you not to stay long . If you are going to be like this , you will only upset her , and in any case I expect your mother is beginning to wonder about you ."
因 向 贾蓉 说道 ： “ 你 先 同 你 宝 叔叔 过去 罢 ； 我 还 略 坐坐 呢 。 ”,"- You go on ahead with Uncle Bao , ' she said to Jia Rong . ' I am going to sit a little longer with your wife . '"
贾蓉 听说 ， 即同 宝玉 过会芳 园 去 。 这里 凤姐儿 又 劝解 了 一番 ， 又 低 低 说 许多 衷肠 话儿 。 尤氏 打发 人 来 两三遍 ， 凤姐儿 才 向 秦氏 说道 ： “ 你好 生养 着 ， 我 再 来看 你 罢 。,"Jia Rong at once led Bao-yu away to join the others in the All-scents Garden , while Xi-feng addressed some words of encouragement to Qin-shi , after which , dropping her voice to a murmur , she engaged in a long and intimate conversation with her , ignoring two or three messages from You-shi urging her to join the party . At last she felt unable to stay any longer . ' Look after yourself ! ' she said . ' I shall come again ."
合该 你 这病 要 好 了 ， 所以 前日 遇 着 这个 好 大夫 ， 再也 是 不怕 的 了 。 ”,"I feel sure that you are meant to get better . It can not have been an accident that they found that doctor the other day ; and now that you have got him , there is really nothing to worry about . '"
秦氏笑 道 ： “ 任凭 他 是 神仙 ， ‘ 治 了 病治 不了 命 ’ 。 婶子 ， 我 知道 这 病 不过 是 挨 日子 的 。 ”,"Qin-shi smiled . ' Even if he is a miracle-man , Auntie , "" death 's a sickness none can cure "" , and I know that its just a question of time now . '"
凤姐 说道 ： “ 你 只管 这么 想 ， 这 那里 能 好 呢 ？,"' If you will go on talking like that , how can you possibly get better ? ' said Xi-feng ."
总 要 想开 了 才 好 。,' If only you would try to look on the bright side .
况且 听 得 大夫 说 ： 若是 不治 ， 怕 的 是 春天 不好 。,"Remember what the doctor said . He said that if you were not being properly treated , next spring would be dangerous for you ."
咱们 若 是 不能 吃 人参 的 人家 ， 也 难说 了 ；,"If this were a household which could not afford things like ginseng for your treatment , you might have something to worry about ."
你 公公 婆婆 听见 治 得 好 ， 别说 一日 二 钱 人参 ， 就是 二斤 也 吃得起 。,"But now they know that you can be cured , there is nothing Rong 's parents would not do and nothing they could not afford to do for you . Never mind two drams of ginseng a day ; if you needed two pounds a day , they would get it for you gladly ."
好 生养 着罢 ， 我 就 过 园子 里 去 了 。 ”,So do try and get better ! I must go over to the garden now . '
秦氏 又 道 ： “ 婶子 ， 恕 我 不能 跟 过去 了 。,"' Forgive me for not being able to see you out , Auntie , ' said Qin-shi ."
闲 了 的 时候 还求 过来 瞧瞧 我 呢 ， 咱们 娘儿们 坐坐 ， 多 说 几句 闲话 儿 。 ”,"' Please come again when you are free . We will have a nice talk together , just the two of us . '"
凤姐儿 听 了 ， 不觉 的 眼圈儿 又 红 了 ， 道 ： “ 我 得 了 闲儿 必常 来看 你 。 ”,"There were tears in Xi-feng 's eyes as she promised to come often , whenever she was free ."
于是 带 着 跟来 的 婆子 媳妇 们 ， 并 宁府 的 媳妇 婆子 们 ， 从 里头 绕进 园子 的 便门 来 。,"Then , followed by the women who had accompanied her from the Rong mansion and a number of female domestics belonging to the Ning household , she made her way round to one of the side gates leading into the gardens ."
只见 ：,
黄花 满地 ， 白柳横 坡 。,Golden chrysanthemums covered the open spaces ; Silvery willow-trees bordered the water 's margins .
小桥 通若耶 之 溪 ， 曲径 接 天台 之 路 。,The little bridge arched its span over a storied stream ; The winding path made its way into a fairy hill .
石中 清流 滴滴 ， 篱落 飘香 ；,Crystal rills tinkled amidst the rocks . A quickset hedge recalled preautumnal fragrances .
树头 红叶 翩翩 ， 疏林 如 画 。,Crimson leaves fluttered upon the boughs . A wintry copse described calligraphic traceries .
西风 乍 紧 ， 犹 听 莺啼 ；,In the cold wind 's more insistent blast The oriole 's cry could still be heard .
暖 日常 喧 ， 又 添 蛩 语 。,In the late sun 's more infrequent warmth The cricket 's chirp a while revived .
遥望 东南 ， 建 几处 依山 之 榭 ；,At the far south-east end Pavilions nestled in artificial mountains .
近观 西北 ， 结 三间 临水 之轩 。,On the near north-west side Verandahs brooded on circumjacent waters .
笙簧 盈座 ， 别 有 幽情 ；,Music g little organs playing in the summer-house Increased the melancholy in the air .
罗绮 穿林 ， 倍 添 韵致 。,Glimpses of women 's dresses flitting through the little wood Enhanced the delicacy of the scene .
凤姐儿 看着 园中 景致 ， 一步步 行来 ， 正 赞赏 时 ， 猛然 从 假 山石 后 走出 一个 人 来 ， 向前 对 凤姐 说道 ： “ 请 嫂子 安 。 ”,"Xi-feng was making her way through the garden , admiring the view as she went , when a figure suddenly stepped out from behind an artificial hill of rock and made its way towards her : ' How are you cousin ? '"
凤姐 猛吃 一 惊 ， 将身 往后 一 退 ， 说道 ： “ 这 是 瑞 大爷 不是 ？ ”,Xi-feng gave a start of surprise and retreated a step . ' Is not it Cousin Rui ? '
贾瑞 说道 ： “ 嫂子 连 我 也 不 认得 了 ？ ”,"' Do not you even know who I am , cousin ? '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 不是 不 认得 ： 猛然 一 见 ， 想不到 是 大爷 在 这里 。 ”,"' It is not that I do not know you , ' said Xi-feng , ' but you did come up rather suddenly and I was not expecting to see you here . '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 也 是 合该 我 与 嫂子 有缘 。,"' We must have been fated to meet , cousin , ' said Jia Rui ."
我 方才 偷出 了席 ， 在 这里 清净 地方 ， 略散 一散 ， 不想 就 遇见 嫂子 ： 这 不是 有缘 么 ？ ”,"' I had just slipped away from the party to take a little stroll in these peaceful surroundings . I never expected to meet my fair cousin here , but lo ! So there must be a bond . '"
一面 说 着 ， 一面 拿 眼睛 不住 的 观看 凤姐 。,He ogled her as he spoke with a fixed and meaningful stare .
凤姐 是 个 聪明人 ， 见 他 这个 光景 ， 如何 不 猜 八九分 呢 ， 因 向 贾瑞 假意 含笑 道 ： “ 怪不得 你 哥哥 常 提 你 ， 说 你好 。,"Xi-feng 's sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little game he was playing , and feigning an interest she did not feel , she answered him with a smile . ' I can see why Lian is always speaking so highly of you ."
今日 见 了 ， 听 你 这 几句 话儿 ， 就 知道 你 是 个 聪明 和 气 的 人 了 。,"From seeing you today and just hearing you speak those few words I can tell at once that you are an intelligent , good-natured sort of person ."
这 会子 我 要 到 太太 们 那边 去 呢 ， 不得 合 你 说话 ， 等闲 了 再 会 罢 。 ”,"At the moment I am on my way to join my aunts , and I am afraid that I can not stay and talk to you . Perhaps we could meet some other time when we are both free ? '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 我 要 到 嫂子 家里 去 请安 ， 又 怕 嫂子 年轻 ， 不肯 轻易 见 人 。 ”,"' I should like to call on you when you are at home , ' said Jia Rui , ' but I suppose a young person like your good self is not in a position to receive visitors of the other sex . '"
凤姐 又 假笑 道 ： “ 一家 骨肉 ， 说 什么 年轻 不 年轻 的话 。 ”,Xi-feng feigned a laugh . ' We are all one family - all one flesh and blood . I do not see that age comes into it . '
贾瑞 听 了 这话 ， 心中 暗喜 ， 因 想道 ： “ 再 不想 今日 得 此 奇遇 ！ ” 〈 那 神情 光景 亦 发 不堪 难看 了 。 〉,"Jia Rui was secretly delighted by this encouragement . ' I never dreamed today would bring a chance like this my way , ' he thought , and the goatish eagerness of his expression grew even more repellent ."
凤姐儿 说道 ： “ 你 快 去 入席 去 罢 ， 看 他们 拿住 了 ， 罚 你 的 酒 。 ”,"' You had better hurry back to the party , ' said Xi-feng . ' If they catch you playing truant , you will find yourself being sconced ! '"
贾瑞 听 了 ， 身上 已木 了 半边 ， 慢慢 的 走 着 ， 一面 回过头来 看 。,"Jia Rui was by now scarcely in command of his own person . Slowly , very slowly he walked away , frequently turning back to gaze at Xi-feng as he did so ."
凤姐儿 故意 的 把 脚 放迟 了 ， 见 他 去 远 了 ， 心里 暗 忖道 ： “ 这 才 是 ‘ 知人知面不知心 ’ 呢 。,Xi-feng mischievously provoked him by deliberately slowing down the pace of her own progress through the garden .
那里 有 这样 禽兽 的 人 ？,' What an odious creature ! ' she thought to herself when there was some distance between them . ' Appearances certainly are deceptive !
他 果 如此 ， 几时 叫 他 死 在 我 手里 ， 他 才 知道 我 的 手段 ！ ”,Who would have guessed he was that sort of person ?
于是 凤姐儿 方 移步 前来 。,"Well , if he is , he had better look out ! One of these days I will settle his hash for him ; then perhaps he will realize what sort of person he is up against ! '"
将 转过 了 一重 山坡 儿 ， 见 两三个 婆子 慌慌张张 的 走来 ， 见 凤姐儿 ， 笑 道 ： “ 我们 奶奶 见 二 奶奶 不 来 ， 急 的 了不得 ， 叫 奴才 们 又 来 请 奶奶 来 了 。 ”,"Xi-feng had resumed a normal pace and had just skirted the foot of a little hill , when she saw two or three old servingwomen hurrying towards her in a state of great agitation . ' Oh , Mrs Lian , said one of the old women with a smile , when they caught sight of her , ' our mistress has been getting into such a state because you did not come ! She is sent us to fetch you . '"
凤姐儿 说 ： “ 你们 奶奶 就是 这样 ‘ 急 脚 鬼 ’ 似的 。 ” 凤姐儿 慢慢 的 走 着 ， 问 ： “ 戏文 唱 了 几出 了 ？ ”,"' Just like your mistress ! ' said Xi-feng . ' Always in a lather about something or other ! ' and she sauntered on quite unconcernedly , talking to the old woman as she went . ' How many pieces have they done so far ? '"
那婆子 回 道 ： “ 唱 了 八九出 了 。 ”,"' Eight or nine , ' the old woman replied ."
说话 之间 ， 已 到 天香楼 后门 ， 见 宝玉 和 一群 丫头 小子 们 那里 玩 呢 ， 凤姐儿 说 ： “ 宝兄弟 ， 别忒 淘气 了 。 ”,"By this time they had arrived at the rear entrance of the two-storey Celestial Fragrance Pavilion , where they found Bao-yu playing with a group of maids . ' Mind you do not make a nuisance of yourself , Bao , ' said Xi-feng ."
一个 丫头 说道 ： “ 太太 们 都 在 楼上 坐 着 呢 。,"' Lady Xing and Lady Wang are sitting upstairs watching , ' said one of the maids ."
请 奶奶 就 从 这边 上去 罢 。 ”,"' You can get up there from this side , madam . '"
凤姐儿 听 了 ， 款步 提衣 上 了 楼 。,"Lifting up her skirts , Xi-feng climbed slowly up the stairs ."
尤氏 已 在 楼梯口 等 着 。,She found You-shi standing at the top waiting for her .
尤氏笑 道 ： “ 你们 娘儿 两个 忒 好 了 ， 见了面 总 舍不得 来 了 。,"' You are an affectionate pair ! ' said You-shi with a smile . ' Once the two of you meet , there is no separating you ."
你 明日 搬来 和 他 同住 罢 。,Tomorrow you had better move in with her and set up house together !
— — 你 坐下 ， 我 先 敬 你 一钟 。 ”,"Come on , sit down ! I am going to drink a cup of wine with you ! '"
于是 凤姐儿 至 邢夫人 王夫人 前告 坐 。,Xi-feng asked her two aunts for permission to sit .
尤氏 拿 戏单 来 让 凤姐儿 点戏 ， 凤姐儿 说 ： “ 太太 们 在 这里 ， 我 怎么 敢点 。 ”,"When she had done so You-shi held out the playbill and invited her to make a choice . ' It is not for me to choose when Mother and Aunt Wang are here , ' said Xi-feng ."
邢夫人 王夫人 道 ： “ 我们 和 亲家 太太 点 了 好几 出 了 。,' Go ahead and choose ! ' said Lady Xing . ' Mrs You and your aunt and I have already chosen a number of plays .
你 点 几出 好 的 我们 听 。 ”,Now you pick out one or two good ones for us ! '
凤姐儿 立 起身 来 答应 了 ， 接过 戏单 ， 从头 一 看 ， 点 了 一出 “ 还魂 ” ， 一出 “ 弹词 ” ， 递过 戏单 来 ， 说 ： “ 现在 唱 的 这 “ 双官 诰 ” 完 了 ， 再 唱 这 两出 ， 也 就是 时候 了 。 ”,"Xi-feng politely rose to thank her , and taking the playbill from You-shi , scanned it through and picked out two of the items listed : one a scene from The Return of the Soul and the other ' Gui-nian Plays His Guitar ' from The Palace of Eternal Youth . ' If they do these two after they have finished singing this scene from Faithful Bi-lian , ' she said , handing the playbill back to You-shi , ' I think that will be just about enough for the day . '"
王夫人 道 ： “ 可不是 呢 ， 也 该 趁早 叫 你 哥哥 嫂子 歇歇 。,"' I am sure it will , ' said Lady Wang . ' We ought in any case to break up early , so that our hosts can get a good night 's rest ."
他们 心里 又 不静 。 ”,They have had a lot on their minds lately . '
尤氏 道 ： “ 太太 们 又 不是 常来 的 ， 娘儿们 多 坐 一会 子 去 ， 才 有趣儿 。,"' It is not often that you both come to see us , ' said You-shi . ' Please stay as long as you can . It will be so much more fun ."
天气 还 早 呢 。 ”,Its really quite early yet . '
凤姐儿 立 起身 来望 楼下 一 看 ， 说 ： “ 爷们 都 往 那里 去 了 ？ ”,"' Where have all the gentlemen gone to ? ' inquired Xi-feng , who had got up from her seat and was peering down into the lower storey ."
傍边 一个 婆子 道 ： “ 爷们 才 到 凝曦轩 ， 带 了 十番 那里 吃酒 去 了 。 ”,"' They have gone off to the Frozen Sunlight Gallery to drink , said one of the old women in attendance . ' They left only a moment ago . They have taken the band with them . '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 在 这里 不 便宜 ， 背地里 又 不知 干什么 去 了 ！ ”,"' What was wrong with this place ? ' said Xi-feng , ' Heaven knows what they can be getting up to behind our backs ! '"
尤氏笑 道 ： “ 那里 都象 你 这么 正经人 呢 ！ ”,"' We can not all be as strait-laced as you are , ' said You-shi with a laugh ."
于是 说说笑笑 ， 点 的 戏 都 唱 完 了 ， 方才 撤下 酒席 ， 摆上 饭来 。,"As they laughed and chattered together , the actors eventually finished performing the second of the two pieces Xi-feng had selected , whereupon the wine was removed from the tables and rice served ."
吃 毕 ， 大家 才 出 园子 来 ， 到 上房 坐下 ， 吃 了 茶 ， 才 叫 预备 车 ， 向 尤氏 的 母亲 告 了 辞 。,"When they had finished their meal , the company retired to the main reception room indoors and took tea there , after which carriages were called for and the other ladies took their leave of old Mrs You ."
尤氏 率 同 众 姬 妾 并 家人 媳妇 们 送 出来 ， 贾珍 率领 众 子侄 在 车旁 侍立 ， 都 等候 着 ；,"You-shi stood at the head of all the concubines and female domestics of the Ning household to see them outside , while Cousin Zhen at the head of the junior male members of his family stood beside the waiting carriages ."
见 了 邢王二 夫人 ， 说道 ： “ 二位 婶子 明日 还 过来 逛逛 。 ”,"' You must come again tomorrow , ladies , ' said Cousin Zhen to Lady Xing and Lady Wang as they emerged from the house ."
王夫人 道 ： “ 罢了 ， 我们 今儿 整坐 了 一日 ， 也 乏 了 ， 明日 也 要 歇歇 。 ”,"' I think not , ' said Lady Wang . ' We have sat here the whole day being entertained and we are all rather tired now . I think tomorrow we should like a rest . '"
［ 于是 都 上车 去 了 。 ］,
贾瑞犹 不住 拿 眼看 着 凤姐儿 。,Jia Rui was staring fixedly at Xi-feng throughout this exchange .
贾珍 进去 后 ， 李贵才 拉 过 马来 ， 宝玉 骑 上 ， 随了 王夫人 去 了 。,"After Cousin Zhen had gone indoors again , Li Gui led out a horse and Bao-yu mounted on its back and rode off behind Lady Wang 's carriage ."
这里 贾珍 同 一家子 的 弟兄 子侄 吃过饭 ， 方 大家 散 了 。,"Cousin Zhen and the other males then sat down to supper and , when it was over , the party broke up ."
次日 ， 仍 是 众 族人 等 闹 了 一日 ， 不必 细说 。,"Next day there was another day of feasting for the members of the clan , particulars of which , however , we omit from our record ."
此后 凤姐 不时 亲自 来看 秦氏 。,We shall confine ourselves to observing that from that day on Xi-feng paid frequent calls on Qin-shi .
秦氏 也 有 几日 好些 ， 也 有 几日 歹 些 。,"Sometimes her illness seemed slightly better for a day or two , sometimes it seemed slightly worse ."
贾珍 、 尤氏 、 贾蓉 甚是 焦心 。,"Cousin Zhen , You-shi and Jia Rong were acutely worried ."
且说 贾瑞 到 荣府 来 了 几次 ， 偏 都 值 凤姐儿 往 宁府 去 了 。,"Jia Rui made several visits to the Rong mansion , but all his calls seemed to coincide with Xi-feng 's visits to the Ning mansion to see Qin-shi ."
这年 正是 十一月 三十日 冬至 。,"The thirtieth day of the eleventh month , the day of the winter solstice , arrived ."
到 交节 的 那 几日 ， 贾母 、 王夫人 、 凤姐儿 日日 差 人 去 看 秦氏 。,"It was the turn of the season , and for several days before it Grandmother Jia , Lady Wang and Xi-feng had been sending messengers daily to inquire after Qin-shi ."
回来 的 人 都 说 ： “ 这 几日 没见 添病 ， 也 没见 大好 。 ”,"Each time the report they brought back was the same : ' She hasn ' t got any worse these last few days , but she does not seem to be very much better . '"
王夫人 向 贾母 说 ： “ 这个 症候 遇 着 这样 节气 ， 不 添 病 就 有 指望 了 。 ”,"' At this time of year , ' said Lady Wang , its a hopeful sign if an illness like hers does not get any worse . '"
贾母 说 ： “ 可是 呢 ！,' Oh I do hope so ! ' said Grandmother Jia .
好 个 孩子 ， 要 有个 长短 ， 岂 不 叫 人 疼 死 。 ”,"' That sweet child ! If anything should happen to her , it would break my heart . '"
说 着 ， 一阵 心酸 ， 向 凤姐儿 说道 ： “ 你们 娘儿们 好 了 一场 ， 明日 大 初一 ， 过 了 明日 ， 你 再 看看 他 去 。,"A wave of bitterness passed over her . ' You and she have always been good friends , ' she said , turning to Xi-feng . ' Tomorrow is the ' First of the Last ' . Go and see her again some time after tomorrow ."
你 细细的 瞧瞧 他 的 光景 ， 倘或 好些 儿 ， 你 回来 告诉 我 。,"Have a very careful look and try to find out exactly how she is . If she seems a bit better , come and tell me when you get back ."
那 孩子 素日 爱 吃 什么 ， 你 也 常 叫 人 送 些 给 他 。 ”,"And if there is anything the dear child has ever fancied eating in the past , see that she is kept constantly supplied with it . '"
凤姐儿 一一 答应 了 。 到 初二 日 ， 吃 了 早饭 ， 来到 宁府 里 ， 看见 秦氏 光景 ， 虽 未 添 什么 病 ， 但 那 脸上 身上 的 肉 都 瘦干 了 。,"Xi-feng promised to do as she had said , and on the second day of the next month she went over to the Ning-guo mansion as soon as she had finished her breakfast . Qin-shi 's sickness appeared to be no worse than previously , but the flesh on her face and body was pitifully wasted ."
于是 和 秦氏 坐 了 半日 ， 说 了 些 闲话 ， 又 将 这病 无妨 的话 开导 了 一番 。,"Xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her , and once more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness ."
秦氏 道 ： “ 好不好 ， 春天 就 知道 了 。,"' We shall know the worst when the spring comes , ' said Qin-shi ."
如今 现过 了 冬至 ， 又 没 怎么样 ， 或者 好 的 了 也 未可知 。,"' At least I have got past the solstice without anything happening , so perhaps I shall get better ."
婶子 回 老太太 、 太太 放心 罢 。 昨日 老太太 赏 的 那 枣泥 馅 的 山药 糕 ， 我 吃 了 两块 ， 倒象 克化 的 动 的 似的 。 ”,"Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my regards , will not you . I have eaten one or two bits of that yam-cake with the date stuff inside that Grandma sent me yesterday . I found it quite easy to digest . '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 明日 再 给 你 送来 。,"' I will send you some more tomorrow , ' said Xi-feng ."
我 到 你 婆婆 那里 瞧瞧 ， 就要 赶着 回去 回 老太太 话 去 。 ”,"Now I must go and see your mother-in-law , and after that I have to hurry back and give my report on you to Grandma . '"
秦氏 道 ： “ 婶子 替 我 请 老太太 、 太太 的 安罢 。 ”,"' Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my love , Auntie . '"
凤姐儿 答应 着 就 出来 了 。,"' I will , ' said Xi-feng , and left her ."
到 了 尤氏 上房 坐下 。,She went into You-shi 's reception room and sat down .
尤氏 道 ： “ 你 冷眼 瞧 媳妇 是 怎么样 ？ ”,"' Tell me honestly , ' said You-shi . ' What did you think of her ? '"
凤姐儿 低 了 半日头 ， 说道 ： “ 这个 就 没法儿 了 。,"Xi-feng sat silent for some time with lowered head . ' There is no hope , is there ?"
你 也 该 将 一应 的 后事 给 他 料理 料理 ， — — 冲一 冲 也好 。 ”,"You will have to start getting things ready for the end . Of course , it is always possible that doing so may break the bad luck . '"
尤氏 道 ： “ 我 也 暗暗 的 叫 人 预备 了 。,"' I have already been quietly making a few preparations on the side , ' said You-shi ."
就是 那 件 东西 不得 好 木头 ， 且 慢慢 的 办 着 呢 。 ”,' The only thing we haven ' t yet got is the right timber for the you know what . But were looking round all the time . '
于是 凤姐儿 喝 了 茶 ， 说 了 一会 子话儿 ， 说道 ： “ 我 要 快 些 回去 回 老太太 的话 去 呢 。 ”,Xi-feng had some tea and chatted a while longer with You-shi . Then she said : ' I must hurry back to report to Grandma . '
尤氏 道 ： “ 你 可 慢慢儿 的 说 ， 别 吓 着 老人家 。 ”,"' Break it to her gently , ' said You-shi . ' You do not want to give her a shock , at her age . '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 我 知道 。 ” 于是 凤姐儿 起身 ， 回到 家中 ， 见 了 贾母 ， 说 ： “ 蓉 哥 媳妇 请 老太太 安 ， 给 老太太 磕头 ， 说 他 好些 了 。,"' Of course , ' said Xi-feng , and rising to her feet went straight back home and called on Grandmother Jia . ' Rong 's wife asked me to give you her regards , Grandma . She sends you a kotow and she says she feels somewhat better ."
求 老祖宗 放心 罢 。,She begs you not to worry about her .
他 再 略 好些 ， 还给 老太太 磕头 请安 来 呢 。 ”,And she says that when she is made a bit more progress she is going to come over to see you and make you a kotow in person . '
贾母 道 ： “ 你 瞧 他 是 怎么样 ？ ”,' How did you think she seemed ? ' said Grandmother Jia .
凤姐儿 说 ： “ 暂且 无妨 ； 精神 还好 呢 。 ”,"' For the time being there does not seem to be anything much to worry about , ' said Xi-feng . ' She seems to be in quite good spirits . '"
贾母 听 了 ， 沉吟 了 半日 ， 因 向凤姐 说 ： “ 你 换换 衣裳 歇歇 去 罢 。 ”,"For a long time the old lady brooded in silence . Then , remembering Xi-feng , she told her to change her clothes and rest a while ."
凤姐儿 答应 着 出来 ， 见 过 了 王夫人 ， 到 了 家中 ， 平儿 将 烘 的 家常 衣服 给 凤姐儿 换上 了 。,"Xi-feng said yes , she would , and after calling on Lady Wang , went back to her own apartment , where Patience had warmed her everyday clothes for her to change into ."
凤姐儿 坐下 ， 因 问 ： “ 家中 有 什么 事 没有 ？ ”,"When she had changed , she sat down and asked Patience if anything had happened during her absence ."
平儿方 端 了 茶 来 递过去 ， 说道 ： “ 没有 什么 事 。,"' Nothing , really , ' said Patience , handing her some tea ."
就是 那 三百两 银子 的 利银 ， 旺儿 嫂子 送进来 ， 我 收 了 。,' Brightie 's wife came with the interest on the three hundred taels of silver and I received it for you .
还有 瑞 大爷 使 人 来 打听 奶奶 在家 没有 ， 他 要 来 请安 说话 。 ”,"Oh , and Mr Rui sent someone to ask if you were in . He wants to pay you a call and talk about something . '"
凤姐儿 听 了 ， 哼 了 一声 ， 说道 ： “ 这 畜生 合该 作 死 ， 看 他 来 了 怎么样 ！ ”,"Xi-feng snorted . ' Horrible creature ! he seems to be looking for trouble . Just let him come , then ! '"
平儿 回 道 ： “ 这 瑞 大爷 是 为什么 ， 只管 来 ？ ”,' What does Mr Rui want ? ' asked Patience . ' Why does he keep coming like this ? '
凤姐儿 遂 将 九月 里 在 宁府 园子 里 遇见 他 的 光景 、 他 说 的话 ， 都 告诉 了 平儿 。,In reply Xi-feng gave her a full account of her encounter with him in the garden of the Ning-guo mansion and of the things he had said to her on that occasion .
平儿 说道 ： “ ‘ 癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉 ’ ， 没 人伦 的 混账 东西 ， 起 这样 念头 ， 叫 他 不得好死 ！ ”,"' What a nasty , disgusting man ! ' said Patience . ' A case of "" the toad on the ground wanting to eat the goose in the sky "" . He will come to no good end , getting ideas like that ! '"
凤姐儿 道 ： “ 等 他 来 了 ， 我 自有 道理 。 ”,' Just wait till he comes ! ' said Xi-feng . ' I know how to deal with him . '
不知 贾瑞 来时 作 何光景 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"But if you wish to know the outcome of Jia Rui 's visit , you will have to read the next chapter ."
第十二回,Chapter 12
王熙凤 毒 设 相思 局,Wang Xi-feng sets a trap for her admirer
贾天祥 正 照 风月 鉴,And Jia Rui looks into the wrong side of the mirror
话 说 凤姐正 与 平儿 说话 ， 只见 有人 回说 ： “ 瑞 大爷 来 了 。 ”,Jia Rui is arrival was announced while Xi-feng and Patience were still talking about him .
凤姐命 ： “ 请进来 罢 。 ”,"' Ask him in , ' said Xi-feng ."
贾瑞见 请 ， 心中 暗喜 。,"Hearing that he was to be received , Jia Rui rejoiced inwardly ."
见 了 凤姐 ， 满面 陪笑 ， 连连 问好 。,He came into the room wreathed in smiles and overwhelmed Xi-feng with civilities .
凤姐儿 也 假意 殷勤 让 坐 让茶 。,With feigned solicitude she pressed him to be seated and to take tea .
贾瑞见 凤姐 如此 打扮 ， 越发 酥 倒 ， 因 伤 了 眼 问道 ： “ 二 哥哥 怎么 还 不 回来 ？ ”,"He became quite ecstatic at the sight of her informal dress . ' Why is not Cousin Lian back yet ? ' he asked , staring with fascinated eyes ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 不知 什么 缘故 。 ”,"' I do not know what the reason can be , said Xi-feng ."
贾瑞笑 道 ： “ 别 是 路上 有人 绊住 了 脚 ， 舍不得 回来 了 罢 ？ ”,"' Could it be , ' Jia Rui inquired archly , ' that Someone has detained him on his way home and that he can not tear himself away ? '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 可知 男人家 见 一个 爱 一个 也 是 有 的 。 ”,' Men are all the same ! ' said Xi-feng . ' They have only to set eyes on a woman to begin another affair . '
贾瑞笑 道 ： “ 嫂子 这话 错 了 ， 我 就 不是 这样 人 。 ”,"' Ah , there you are wrong ! ' said Jia Rui . ' I am not that sort of man . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 象 你 这样 的 人 能 有 几个 呢 ， 十个 里 也 挑不出 一个 来 ！ ”,' But how many men are there like you ? ' said Xi-feng . ' I doubt you could find one in ten .
贾瑞 听 了 ， 喜 的 抓耳挠腮 。,At this last remark Jia Rui positively scratched his ears with pleasure .
又 道 ： “ 嫂子 天天 也 闷 的 很 。 ”,"' You must find it very dull here on your own every day , ' he said ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 正是 呢 。,"' Yes , indeed ! ' said Xi-feng ."
只 盼 个人 来 说话 解解闷 儿 。 ”,' If only there were someone who could come and talk to me and help me to pass the time ! '
贾瑞笑 道 ： “ 我 倒 天天 闲着 。,"' Well , ' said Jia Rui , ' I am always free ."
若 天天 过来 替 嫂子 解解闷 儿 ， 可好 么 ？ ”,How would it be if I were to come every day to help you pass the time ? '
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 哄 我 呢 ！,' You must be joking ! ' said Xi-feng .
你 那里 肯往 我 这里 来 ？ ”,' What would you want to come here for ? '
贾瑞道 ： “ 我 在 嫂子 面前 ， 若 有 一句 谎话 ， 天打雷劈 ！,"' I mean every word I say , ' said Jia Rui . ' May I be struck by lightning if I do not !"
只 因素 日 闻 得 人 说 ， 嫂子 是 个 利害 人 ， 在 你 跟前 一点 也 错 不得 ， 所以 唬住 我 了 。 我 如今 见 嫂子 是 个 有说有笑 极 疼 人 的 ， 我 怎么 不 来 ？,"True , there was a time when I should have been scared to come , because people always told me what a holy terror you were and how dangerous it was to cross you ; but now I know that in reality you are all gentleness and fun , there is nothing that could stop me coming ."
— — 死 了 也 情愿 。 ”,I would come now if it cost me my life . '
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 果然 你 是 个 明白人 ， 比蓉儿 兄弟 两个 强远 了 。,"' It is true then , ' said Xi-feng , smiling delightedly . ' You really are an understanding sort of person - so much more so than Rong or Qiang !"
我 看 他 那样 清秀 ， 只当 他们 心里 明白 ， 谁知 竟是 两个 糊涂虫 ， 一点 不知 人心 。 ”,"I used to think that since they were such handsome and cultured-looking young men they must be understanding as well , but they turned out to be stupid brutes without the least consideration for other people 's feelings . '"
贾瑞 听 这话 ， 越发 撞 在 心坎 上 ， 由不得 又 往前 凑 一凑 ， 觑 着 眼看 凤姐 的 荷包 ， 又 问 ： “ 戴 着 什么 戒指 ？ ”,"This little speech went straight to Jia Rui 's heart , and unconsciously he began edging his seat nearer to Xi-feng 's . He peered closely at an embroidered purse that she was wearing and expressed a strong interest in one of her rings ."
凤姐 悄悄的 道 ： “ 放 尊重 些 ， 别 叫 丫头 们 看见 了 。 ”,' Take care ! ' said Xi-feng in a low tone . ' The servants might see you ! '
贾瑞如 听 纶音佛语 一般 ， 忙 往 后退 ， 凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 该 去 了 。 ”,"Obedient to his goddess 's command , Jia Rui quickly drew back again . Xi-feng laughed . ' You had better go ! '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 我 再 坐 一 坐 儿 ， — — 好 狠心 的 嫂子 ！ ”,"' Ah no , cruel cousin ! Let me stay a little longer ! '"
凤姐儿 又悄俏 的 道 ： “ 大天白日 人来人往 ， 你 就 在 这里 也 不 方便 。,"' Even if you stay , its not very convenient here in broad daylight , with people coming and going all the time ."
你 且 去 ， 等到 晚上 起 了 更 你 来 ， 悄悄的 在 西边 穿堂 儿 等 我 。 ”,"Go away now and come back later when it is dark , at the beginning of the first watch . You can slip into the gallery west of this apartment and wait for me there . '"
贾瑞 听 了 ， 如 得 珍宝 ， 忙 问道 ： “ 你 别 哄 我 。,Jia Rui received these words like someone being presented with a rare and costly jewel . ' Are you sure you are not joking ? ' he asked hurriedly .
但是 那里 人 过 的 多 ， 怎么 好 躲 呢 ？ ”,' A lot of people must go through that way . How should we avoid being seen ? '
凤姐 道 ： “ 你 只 放心 ， 我 把 上夜 的 小厮 们 都 放 了 假 ， 两边 门 一 关 ， 再 没 别人 了 。 ”,"' Do not worry ! said Xi-feng . ' I will give the watchmen a night off . When the side gates are closed , no one else can get through . '"
贾瑞 听 了 ， 喜之 不尽 ， 忙忙 的 告辞 而 去 ， 心 内 以为 得手 。,"Jia Rui was beside himself with delight and hurriedly took his leave , confident that the fulfilment of all he wished for was now in sight ."
盼 到 晚上 ， 果然 黑 地里 摸入 荣府 ， 趁 掩门 时 ， 钻入 穿堂 。 果见 漆黑 无一 人 来往 ， 贾母 那边 去 的 门 已 倒锁 了 ， 只有 向东 的 门 未 关 。,"Having waited impatiently for nightfall , he groped his way into the Rong-guo mansion just before they closed the gates and slipped into the gallery , now totally deserted - as Xi-feng had promised it would be - and black as pitch . The gate at the end of the alley-way opening on to Grandmother Jia 's quarters had already been barred on the outer side ; only the gate at the east end remained open ."
贾瑞 侧耳 听 着 ， 半日 不见 人 来 。,"For a long time Jia Rui listened intently , but no one came ."
忽 听 “ 咯 噫 ” 一声 ， 东边 的 门 也 关上 了 。,"Suddenly there was a loud slam and the gate at the east end , too , banged shut ."
贾瑞 急 的 也 不敢 则 声 ， 只得 悄悄 出来 ， 将门 撼 了 撼 ， 关 得 铁桶 一般 。,"Alarmed , but not daring to make a sound , Jia Rui stealthily crept out and tried it . It was locked - as tight as a bucket ."
此时 要 出去 ， 亦 不能 了 ： 南北 俱 是 大墙 ， 要 跳 也 无 攀援 。,"Now even if he wanted to get out he could not , for the walls on either side of the alley-way were too high to scale ."
这 屋内 又 是 过堂风 ， 空落落 的 ； 现 是 腊月 天气 ， 夜 又 长 ， 朔风 凛凛 ， 侵 肌 裂骨 ， 一夜 几乎 不曾 冻死 ！,Moreover the gallery was bare and draughty and this was the midwinter season when the nights are long and the bitter north wind seems to pierce into the very marrow of the bones . By the end of the night he was almost dead with cold .
好容易 盼 到 早晨 ， 只见 一个 老婆子 先 将 东门 开 了 进来 ， 去 叫 西门 ， 贾瑞 瞅 他 背着 脸 ， 一溜烟 抱 了 肩 跑 出来 。,"When at last morning came , Jia Rui saw the gate at the east end open and an old woman pass through to the gate opposite and call for someone to open up . Still hugging himself against the cold , he sprinted out of the other gate while her back was towards him ."
幸而 天气 尚早 ， 人 都 未 起 ， 从 后门 一 径 跑 回家 去 。,"Fortunately no one was about at that early hour , and he was able to slip out of the rear entrance of the mansion and run back home unseen ."
原来 贾瑞 父母 早 亡 ， 只有 他 祖父 代 儒教 养 。,Jia Rui had lost both of his parents in infancy and had been brought up under the sole guardianship of his grandfather Jia Dai-ru .
那代儒 素日 教训 最严 ， 不许 贾瑞 多 走 一步 ， 生怕 他 在外 吃酒 赌钱 ， 有 悮 学业 。,"Obsessed by the fear that once outside the house his grandson might indulge in drinking and gambling to the detriment of his studies , Dai-ru had subjected him since early youth to an iron discipline from which not the slightest deviation was tolerated ."
今 忽 见 他 一夜 不 归 ， 只 料定 他 在外 非 饮 即 赌 ， 嫖娼 宿妓 ， 那里 想到 这 段 公案 ？ 因此 也 气 了 一夜 。,"Seeing him now suddenly absent himself a whole night from home , and being incapable , in his wildest imaginings , of guessing what had really happened , he took it as a foregone conclusion that he had been either drinking or gaming and had probably passed the night in some house of prostitution - a supposition which caused the old gentleman to spend the whole night in a state of extreme choler ."
贾瑞 也 捻 着 一把汗 ， 少不得 回来 撒谎 ， 只 说 ： “ 往 舅舅家 去 了 ， 天黑 了 ， 留 我 住 了 一夜 。 ”,"The prospect of facing his grandfather on arrival made Jia Rui sweat . A lie of some sort was indispensable . ' I went to see Uncle yesterday , ' he managed to say , ' and as it was getting dark , he asked me to stay the night . '"
代 儒道 ： “ 自来 出门 非禀 我 不敢 擅出 ， 如何 昨日 私自 去 了 ！,"' I have always told you that you are not to go out of that gate without first informing me , ' said his grandfather . ' Why then did you presume to go off on your own yesterday without saying a word to anybody ?"
据此 也 该 打 ， 何况 是 撒谎 ！ ”,That in itself would constitute sufficient grounds for chastisement . But in addition to that you are lying ! '
因此 发狠 按倒 打 了 三四十 板 ， 还 不许 他 吃饭 ， 叫 他 跪 在 院内 读 文章 ， 定要 补出 十天 工课 来方 罢 。,"Thereupon he forced him to the ground , and , with the utmost savagery , dealt him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo , after which he forbade him to eat and made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared the equivalent of ten day 's homework ."
贾瑞先 冻 了 一夜 ， 又 挨 了 打 ， 又 饿着肚子 ， 跪 在 风 地里 念 文章 ： 其 苦 万状 。,"The exquisite torments suffered by Jia Rui , as he knelt with an empty stomach in the draughty courtyard reciting his homework after having already been frozen all night long and then beaten , can be imagined ."
此时 贾瑞 邪心 未改 ， 再 不 想到 凤姐 捉弄 他 。,Yet even now his infatuation remained unaltered . It never entered his mind that he had been made a fool of .
过 了 两日 ， 得 了 空儿 ， 仍 找寻 凤姐 。,"And so two days later , as soon as he had some free time , he was back once more looking for Xi-feng ."
凤姐 故意 抱怨 他 失信 ， 贾瑞 急 的 起誓 。,"She deliberately reproached him for having failed her , thereby so exasperating him that he swore by the most terrible oaths that he had been faithful ."
凤姐 因 他 自投罗网 ， 少不的 再 寻别 计令 他 知改 ， 故 又 约 他 道 ： “ 今日 晚上 ， 你 别 在 那里 了 ， 你 在 我 这 房 后 小 过 道 儿 里头 那间 空 屋子里 等 我 。,"Seeing him hurl himself so willingly into the net , Xi-feng decided that a further lesson would be needed to cure him of his folly and proposed another assignation . ' Only tonight , ' she said , ' do not wait for me in that place again . Wait in the empty room in the little passage-way behind this apartment ."
— — 可别 冒 撞 了 ！ ”,But mind you do not run into anybody . '
贾瑞道 ： “ 果真 么 ？ ”,' Do you really mean this ? ' said Jia Rui .
凤姐 道 ： “ 你 不信 就别 来 ！ ”,"' If you do not believe me , do not come ! '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 必来 ， 必来 ！,' I will come ! I will come ! ' said Jia Rui .
死 也 要来 的 ！ ”,"' Whatever happens , I shall be there . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 这 会子 你 先 去 罢 。 ”,' Now I think you had better go . '
贾瑞 料定 晚间 必妥 ， 此时 先 去 了 。,"Confident of seeing her again in the evening , Jia Rui went off uncomplainingly , leaving Xi-feng time to muster her forces , brief her officers , and prepare the trap in which the luckless man was to be caught ."
凤姐 在 这里 便点 兵派 将 ， 设 下 圈套 。,Jia Rui waited for the evening with great impatience .
那 贾瑞 只 盼 不到 晚 ， 偏偏 家里 亲戚 又 来 了 ， 吃 了 晚饭 才 去 ， 那天 已有 掌灯 时候 ； 又 等 他 祖父 安歇 ， 方 溜进 荣府 ， 往 那 夹道 中 屋子里 来 等 着 ， 热锅 上 蚂蚁 一般 。,"By a stroke of bad luck some relations came on a visit and stayed to supper . It was already lamplight when they left , and Jia Rui then had to wait for his grandfather to settle down for the night before he could scuttle of to the Rong mansion and make his way to the room in the little passage-way where Xi-feng had told him to go . He waited there for her arrival with the frenzied agitation of an ant on a hot saucepan ."
只是 左等 不见 人影 ， 右 听 也 没 声响 ， 心中 害怕 ， 不住 猜疑 道 ： “ 别 是 不来 了 ， 又 冻 我 一夜 不成 … … ？ ”,"Yet , though he waited and waited , not a human shape appeared nor a human sound was heard , and he began to be frightened and a little suspicious : ' Surely she will not fail me ? Surely I shall not be made to spend another night in the cold . . . '"
正 自 胡 猜 ， 只见 黑 魆 魆 的 进来 一个 人 。,"As he was in the midst of these gloomy imaginings , a dark figure glided into the room ."
贾瑞 便 打定 是 凤姐 ， 不管 青红皂白 ， 那人 刚 到 面前 ， 便 如 饿虎扑食 、 猫儿 捕鼠 的 一般 ， 抱住 叫 道 ： “ 亲 嫂子 ， 等 死 我 了 ！ ” 说 着 ， 抱到 屋里 炕上 就 亲嘴 扯 裤子 ， 满口 里 “ 亲爹 ” “ 亲娘 ” 的 乱叫 起来 。,"Certain that it must be Xi-feng , Jia Rui cast all caution to the winds and , when the figure approached him , threw himself upon it like a hungry tiger seizing its prey or a cat pouncing on a harmless mouse . ' My darling , how I have waited for you ! ' he exclaimed , enfolding his beloved in his arms ; and carrying her to the kang , he laid her down and began kissing her and tugging at her trousers , murmuring ' my sweetest darling ' and ' my honey love ' and other such endearments in between kisses ."
那人 只 不做声 ， 贾瑞 便 扯 下 自己 的 裤子 来 ， 硬帮帮 就 想 顶入 。,Throughout all of this not a single sound was uttered by his partner . Jia Rui now tore down his own trousers and prepared to thrust home his hard and throbbing member .
忽然 灯光 一 闪 ， 只见 贾蔷举 着 个 蜡台 ， 照道 ： “ 谁 在 这 屋里 呢 ？ ”,Suddenly a light flashed - and there was Jia Qiang holding aloft a candle in a candlestick which he shone around : ' Who is in this room ? '
只见 炕上 那人 笑 道 ： “ 瑞 大叔 要 肏 我 呢 ！ ”,At this the person on the kang gave a giggle : ' Uncle Rui is trying to bugger me ! '
贾瑞 不 看 则 已 ， 看 了 时 真臊 的 无地 可入 ， — — 你 道 是 谁 ？,Horrors ! The sight he saw when he looked down made Jia Rui want to sink into the ground .
却是 贾蓉 。,It was Jia Rong !
贾瑞 回身 要 跑 ， 被 贾蔷 一把 揪住 ， 道 ： “ 别 走 ！,"He turned to bolt , but Jia Qiang held him fast . ' Oh no you do not !"
如今 琏 二 婶子 已经 告到 太太 眼前 ， 说 你 调戏 他 ， 他 暂时 稳住 你 在 这里 。,Auntie Lian has already told Lady Wang that you have been pestering her . She asked us to keep you here while she went to tell .
太太 听见 气死 过去 了 ， 这 会子 叫 我 来 拿 你 。,"When Lady Wang first heard , she was so angry that she fainted , but now she is come round again and is asking for you to be brought to her ."
快 跟我走 罢 ！ ”,"Come along , then ! Off we go ! '"
贾瑞 听 了 ， 魂不附体 ， 只 说 ： “ 好 侄儿 ！ 你 只 说 没有 我 ， 我 明日 重重的 谢 你 ！ ”,"At these words Jia Rui 's soul almost left its seat in his body . ' My dear nephew , just tell her that you did not find me here ! ' he said . ' Tomorrow I will reward you handsomely . '"
贾蔷道 ： “ 放 你 不值 什么 ， 只 不知 你 谢 我 多少 ？,"' I suppose I could let you go easily enough , said Jia Qiang . ' The question is , how big would this reward be ?"
况且 口说无凭 ， 写 一张 文契 才 算 。 ”,"In any case , just saying that you will give me a reward is no good . I should want a written guarantee . '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 这 怎么 落纸 呢 ？ ”,' But I can not put a thing like this down in writing ! '
贾蔷道 ： “ 这 也 不妨 ， 写 个 赌钱 输 了 ， 借 银 若干 两 ， 就 完 了 。 ”,"' No problem there , ' said Jia Qiang . ' Just say that you have lost money gambling and have borrowed such and such an amount to cover your losses . That is all you need do . '"
贾瑞道 ： “ 这 也 容易 。 ”,"' I could do that , certainly , ' said Jia Rui ."
贾蔷 翻身 出来 ， 纸笔 现成 ， 拿来 叫 贾瑞 写 。,Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance .
他 两个 做好做歹 ， 只 写 了 五十两 银子 ， 画 了 押 ， 贾蔷收 起来 。 然后 撕 掳 贾蓉 。,"Writing at his dictation Jia Rui was compelled , in spite of protests , to put down fifty taels of silver as the amount on the IOU . The document , having been duly signed , was at once pocketed by Jia Qiang , who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong ."
贾蓉先 咬定 牙 不依 ， 只 说 ： “ 明日 告诉 族 中 的 人 评评理 。 ”,But Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and insisted that he would lay the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done .
贾瑞 急 的 至于 磕头 。,Jia Rui became quite frantic and kotowed to him .
贾蔷 做好做歹 的 ， 也 写 了 一张 五十两 欠 契 才 罢 。,"Finally , under pressure from Jia Qiang and in return for another IOU for fifty taels of silver made out in his favour , he allowed his scruples to be overcome ."
贾蔷又 道 ： “ 如今 要放 你 ， 我 就 担着 不是 。,"' You realize , do not you , ' said Jia Qiang , ' that I am going to get into trouble for this ?"
,Now let is see .
老太太 那边 的 门 早已 关 了 。 老爷 正在 厅 上 看 南京 来 的 东西 ， 那 一条 路定 难 过去 。,"The gate leading to Lady Jia is courtyard was bolted some time ago , and Sir Zheng is at the moment in the main reception room looking at some stuff that has just arrived from Nanking , so you can not go through that way ."
如今 只好 走后门 。,The only way left would be through the back gate .
要 这一 走 ， 倘或 遇见 了 人 ， 连 我 也 不好 。,"The trouble is , though , that if you leave now , you might run into someone on the way , and then I should get into even worse trouble ."
等 我 先 去 探探 ， 再来 领 你 。,You would better let me scout around a bit first and come for you when the coast is clear .
这 屋里 你 还 藏不住 ， 少时 就 来 堆 东西 ， 等 我 寻 个 地方 。 ”,"In the meantime you can not hide here , though , because they will shortly be coming in to store the stuff from Nanking here . I will find somewhere else for you . '"
说 毕 ， 拉 着 贾瑞 ， 仍 息 了 灯 ， 出至 院外 ， 摸 着 大 台阶 底下 ， 说道 ： “ 这 窝 儿 里 好 。,"He took Jia Rui by the arm and having first blown the candle out , led him into the courtyard and groped his way round to the underside of the steps which led up to the terrace of the central building . ' This hollow under the steps will do ."
只 蹲 着 ， 别 哼 一声 。,"Crouch down there , and do not make a sound !"
等 我 来 再 走 。 ”,You can go when I come for you . '
说 毕 ， 二人 去 了 。,Jia Qiang and Jia Rong then went off leaving him to himself .
贾瑞 此时 身不由己 ， 只得 蹲 在 那 台阶 下 。 正要 盘算 ， 只 听 头顶 上 一 声响 ， 哗喇喇 一 净桶 尿 粪 从 上面 直 泼下来 ， 可巧 浇 了 他 一身 一头 。 贾瑞掌 不住 “ 暧哟 ” 一声 ， 忙 又 掩 住口 ， 不敢 声张 ， 满头 满脸 皆 是 尿 屎 ， 浑身 冰冷 打战 。,"Jia Rui , by now a mere automaton in the hands of his captors , obediently crouched down beneath the steps and was just beginning a series of calculations respecting his present financial predicament when a sudden slosh ! signalled the discharge of a slop-pail 's stinking contents immediately above his head , drenching him from top to toe with liquid filth and causing him to cry out in dismay - but only momentarily , for the excrement covered his face and head and caused him to close his mouth again in a hurry and crouch silent and shivering in the icy cold ."
只见 贾 蔷跑 来 叫 ： “ 快 走 ， 快 走 ！ ”,Just then Jia Qiang came running up : ' Hurry ! hurry ! You can go now . '
贾瑞方 得 了 命 ， 三步 两步 从 后门 跑 到 家中 ， 天 已三 更 ， 只得 叫 开了门 。,"At the word of command Jia Rui bounded out of his hole and sprinted for dear life through the rear gate and back to his own home . It was now past midnight , and he had to shout for someone to let him in ."
家人 见 他 这般光景 ， 问 ： “ 是 怎么 了 ？ ” 少不得 撒谎 说 ： “ 天黑 了 ， 失脚 掉 在 茅厕 里 了 。 ”,"When the servant who answered the gate saw the state he was in and asked him how it had happened , he had to pretend that he had been out in the darkness to ease himself and had fallen into the jakes ."
一面 即 到 自己 房中 更衣 洗濯 ， 心 下方 想到 凤姐 玩 他 ， 因此 发 一回 狠 ； 再 想想 凤姐 的 模样儿 标致 ， 又 恨不得 一时 搂 在 怀里 ：,"Then rushing into his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed , his mind running all the time on how Xi-feng had tricked him . The thought of her trickery provoked a surge of hatred in his soul ; yet even as he hated her , the vision of her loveliness made him long to clasp her to his breast ."
胡思乱想 ， 一夜 也 不曾 合眼 。,"Torn by these violent and conflicting emotions , he passed the whole night without a single wink of sleep ."
自此 虽 想 凤姐 ， 只 不敢 往 荣府 去 了 。,"From that time on , though he longed for Xi-feng with unabated passion , he never dared to visit the Rong-guo mansion again ."
贾蓉 等 两个 常常 来 要 银子 ， 他 又 怕 祖父 知道 。,"Jia Rong and Jia Qiang , on the other hand , came frequently to his house to ask for their money , so that he was in constant dread of his grandfather finding out about the IOUs ."
正是 相思 尚且 难禁 ， 况 又 添 了 债务 ， 日间 工课 又 紧 ；,"Unable , even now , to overcome his longing for Xi-feng , saddled with a heavy burden of debt , harassed during the daytime by the schoolwork set him by his exacting grandfather , worn-out during the nights by the excessive hand-pumping inevitable in an unmarried man of twenty whose mistress was both unattainable and constantly in his thoughts , twice frozen , tormented and forced to flee - what constitution could withstand so many shocks and strains without succumbing in the end to illness ?"
他 二十 来 岁 的 人 ， 尚未 娶亲 ， 想着 凤姐 不 得到 手 ， 自 不免有些 “ 指 头儿 告 了 消乏 ” ； 更 兼 两回 冻恼 奔波 ： 因此 三五下 里 夹攻 ， 不觉 就 得 了 一 病 ， — — 心内 发 膨胀 ， 口内 无 滋味 ， 脚下 如绵 ， 眼中 似 醋 ， 黑夜 作烧 ， 白 日常 倦 ， 下溺 遗精 ， 嗽 痰 带 血 ， 诸 如此 症 ， 不 上一年 ， 都 添 全 了 。,"The symptoms of Jia Rui is illness - a palpitation in the heart , a loss of taste in the mouth , a weakness in the hams , a smarting in the eyes , feverishness by night and lassitude by day , albumen in the urine and blood-flecks in the phlegm - had all manifested themselves within less than a year ."
于是 不能 支持 ， 一头 躺倒 ， 合上 眼 还 只 梦魂颠倒 ， 满口胡 话 ， 惊怖 异常 。,"By that time they had produced a complete breakdown and driven him to his bed , where he lay , with eyes tight shut , babbling deliriously and inspiring terror in all who saw him ."
百般 请 医疗 治 ， 诸如 肉桂 、 附子 、 鳖甲 、 麦冬 、 玉竹 等 药 ， 吃 了 有 几十斤 下去 ， 也 不见 个 动静 。,"Physicians were called in to treat him and some bushels of cinnamon bark , autumn root , turtle-shell , black leek and Solomon 's seal must at one time and another have been infused and taken without the least observable effect ."
倏 又 腊尽春回 ， 这 病 更加 沉重 。,Winter went and spring came and Jia Rui is sickness grew even worse .
代儒 也 着 了 忙 ， 各处 请 医疗 治 ， 皆 不 见效 。,His grandfather Dai-ru was in despair . Medical advice from every quarter had been taken and none of it had proved effective .
因 后来 吃 “ 独 参汤 ” ， 代儒 如何 有 这 力量 ， 只得 往 荣府 里来 寻 。,The most recent advice was that the patient should be given a pure decoction of ginseng without admixture of other ingredients . So costly a remedy was far beyond Dai-ru 's resources and he was obliged to go to the Rong-guo mansion to beg .
王夫人 命 凤姐 秤 二两 给 他 。,Lady Wang ordered Wang Xi-feng to weigh out two ounces for him from their own supplies .
凤姐 回说 ： “ 前儿 新近 替 老太太 配 了 药 ， 那 整 的 太太 又 说 留 着 送 杨 提督 的 太太 配药 ， 偏偏 昨儿 我 已经 叫 人 送 了 去 了 。 ”,"' The other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for Grandmother , ' said Xi-feng , ' you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you were sending to General Yang 's wife . I sent her the medicine yesterday , so I am afraid we haven t any left ."
王夫人 道 ： “ 就是 咱们 这边 没 了 ， 你 叫 个人 往 你 婆婆 那里 问问 ， 或是 你 珍大 哥哥 那里 有 ， 寻 些 来 ， 凑 着 给 人家 ， 吃 好 了 ， 救人一命 ， 也 是 你们 的 好处 。 ”,"' Well , even if we haven ' t got any , said Lady Wang , ' you can send to your mother-in-law 's for some ; and probably they will have some at your Cousin Zhen 's . Between you you ought somehow or other to be able to raise enough to give him . If you can save a man 's life by doing so , you will have performed a work of merit . '"
凤姐 应 了 ， 也 不 遣 人 去 寻 ， 只 将 些 渣 末 凑 了 几 钱 ， 命人 送去 ， 只 说 ： “ 太太 叫 送来 的 ， 再也 没 了 。 ”,"But though Xi-feng pretended to do as Lady Wang suggested , in fact she made no such inquiries . She merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent them to Dai-ru with a message that ' Lady Wang had instructed her to send this , and it was all they had . '"
然后 向 王夫人 说 ： “ 都 寻 了 来 了 ， 共 凑 了 二两 多 ， 送去 了 。 ”,"To Lady Wang , however , she reported that she had asked the others and altogether obtained more than two ounces of ginseng which she had sent to Dai-ru ."
那 贾瑞 此时 要命 心急 ， 无药 不吃 ， 只是 白花钱 ， 不 见效 。,"Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swallowed every medicine that they offered him ; but all was a waste of money , for nothing seemed to do him any good ."
忽然 这日 有个 跛足 道人 来 化斋 ， 口称 专治 冤孽 之症 。,One day a lame Taoist appeared at the door asking for alms and claiming to be able to cure retributory illnesses .
贾瑞 偏偏 在内 听见 了 ， 直着 声 叫喊 ， 说 ： “ 快 去 请 进 那位 菩萨 来 救命 ！ ” 一面 在 枕头 上 磕头 。,"Jia Rui , who chanced to overhear him , called out from his bed : ' Quick , tell the holy man to come in and save me ! ' and as he called , he kotowed with his head on the pillow ."
众人 只得 带 进 那道士 来 。,The servants were obliged to bring the Taoist into the bedroom .
贾瑞 一把 拉 住 ， 连 叫 “ 菩萨 救 我 ！ ”,"Jia Rui clung to him tenaciously . ' Holy one , save me ! ' he cried out again and again ."
那道士 叹 道 ： “ 你 这病 非 药 可 医 。,The Taoist sighed . ' No medicine will cure your sickness .
我 有个 宝贝 与 你 ， 你 天天 看 时 ， 此 命 可保 矣 。 ”,"However , I have a precious thing here that I can lend you which , if you will look at it every day , can be guaranteed to save your life . '"
说 毕 ， 从 搭裢 中 取出 个 正面 反面 皆 可 照人 的 镜子 来 ， — — 背上 錾 着 “ 风月 宝鉴 ” 四 字 ， — — 递 与 贾瑞道 ： “ 这 物 出自 太虚幻境 空灵 殿上 ， 警幻 仙子 所制 ， 专治 邪 思 妄动 之症 ， 有 济世 保生 之 功 。 所以 带 他 到 世上 来 ， 单 与 那些 聪明 俊秀 、 风雅 王孙 等 照看 。,"So saying , he took from his satchel a mirror which had reflecting surfaces on both its sides . The words A MIRROR FOR THE ROMANTIC were inscribed on the back . He handed it to Jia Rui . ' This object comes from the Hall of Emptiness in the Land of Illusion . It was fashioned by the fairy Disenchantment as an antidote to the ill effects of impure mental activity . It has life-giving and restorative properties and has been brought into the world for the contemplation of those intelligent and handsome young gentlemen whose hearts are too susceptible to the charms of beauty ."
千万 不可 照 正面 ， 只 照 背面 ， 要紧 ， 要紧 ！,"I lend it to you on one important condition : you must only look into the back of the mirror . Never , never under any circumstances look into the front ."
三日 后 我 来 收取 ， 管 叫 你 病 好 。 ”,"Three days hence I shall come again to reclaim it , by which time I guarantee that your illness will have gone . '"
说 毕 ， 徉 长 而 去 。 众人 苦留 不住 。,"With that he left , at a surprising speed , ignoring the earnest entreaties of those present that he should stay longer ."
贾瑞 接 了 镜子 ， 想道 ： “ 这 道士 倒 有意思 ， 我 何不 照 一 照 试试 ？ ” 想毕 ， 拿起 那 “ 宝鉴 ” 来 ， 向 反面 一 照 ， 只见 一个 骷髅 儿 立 在 里面 。 贾瑞忙 掩 了 ， 骂 那道士 ：,"' This is intriguing ! ' Jia Rui thought to himself when the Taoist gave him the mirror . ' Let me try looking into it as he says , ' and holding it up to his face he looked into the back as instructed and saw a grinning skull , which he covered up hastily with a curse :"
“ 混账 ！ 如何 吓 我 ！,"' Silly old fool , to scare me like that !"
— — 我 倒 再 照照 正面 是 什么 ？ ”,- But let me see what happens when I look into the other side ! '
想着 ， 便 将 正面 一 照 ， 只见 凤姐 站 在 里面 点 手儿 叫 他 。,"He turned the mirror round and looked , and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to him to enter , and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her ."
贾瑞 心中 一 喜 ， 荡 悠悠 觉得 进 了 镜子 ， 与 凤姐 云雨 一番 ， 凤姐 仍 送 他 出来 。,"There they performed the act of love together , after which she saw him out again ."
到 了 床上 ， “ 暧哟 ” 了 一声 ， 一 睁眼 ， 镜子 从新 又 掉 过来 ， 仍 是 反面 立 着 一个 骷髅 。,"But when he found himself once more back in his bed he stared and cried out in horror : for the mirror , of its own accord , had turned itself round in his hand and the same grinning skull faced him that he had seen before ."
贾瑞 自觉 汗津津 的 ， 底下 已 遗 了 一 滩 精 。,He could feel the sweat trickling all over his body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated .
心中 到底 不足 ， 又 翻过 正面 来 ， 只见 凤姐 还 招手 叫 他 ， 他 又 进去 ： 如此 三四次 。,"Yet still he was not satisfied , and turned the face of the mirror once more towards him . Xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling , and again he went in after her . He did this three or four times ."
到 了 这次 ， 刚要 出 镜子 来 ， 只见 两个 人 走来 ， 拿 铁锁 把 他 套住 ， 拉 了 就 走 。,"But the last time , just as he was going to return from the mirror , two figures approached him holding iron chains which they fastened round him and by which they proceeded to drag him away ."
贾瑞 叫 道 ： “ 让我拿 了 镜子 再 走 … … ”,He cried out as they dragged him : ' Wait ! Let me take the mirror with me ...! '
只说 这 句 就 再 不能 说话 了 。,Those were the last words he ever uttered .
旁边 伏侍 的 人 ， 只见 他 先 还 拿 着 镜子 照 ， 落下来 ， 仍 睁开眼 拾 在手 内 ， 末后 镜子 掉下来 ， 便 不动 了 。,"To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it , then to let it drop ; then to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again ; then , as it once more fell from his grasp , he finally ceased to move ."
众人 上 来看 时 ， 已经 咽 了 气 了 ， 身子 底下 冰凉 精湿 遗下 了 一大 滩精 。,"When they examined him more closely they found that his breathing had already stopped and that underneath his body there was a large , wet , icy patch of recently ejaculated semen ."
这 才 忙 着 穿衣 抬床 ， 代儒 夫妇 哭 的 死去活来 ， 大 骂 道士 ： “ 是 何 妖道 ！ ” 遂 命 人 架起 火 来 烧 那 镜子 。,"At once they lifted him from the bed and busied themselves with the laying-out , while old Dai-ru and his wife abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of grief . They cursed the Taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and cast the mirror upon the flames ."
只 听 空中 叫 道 ： “ 谁 叫 他 自己 照 了 正面 呢 ！,"But just at that moment a voice was heard in the air saying , Who told him to look in the front ?"
你们 自己 以 假为 真 ， 为何 烧 我此 镜 ？ ”,"It is you who are to blame , for confusing the unreal with the real ! Why then should you burn my mirror ?"
忽 见 那 镜 从 房中 飞 出 。 代儒 出门 看 时 ， 却 还是 那个 跛足 道人 ， 喊道 ： “ 还 我 的 “ 风月 宝鉴 ” 来 ！ ”,"Suddenly the mirror was seen to rise up and fly out of the room , and when Dai-ru went outside to look , there was the lame Taoist asking for it back ."
说 着 ， 抢 了 镜子 ， 眼看 着 他 飘然 去 了 。,He snatched it as it flew towards him and disappeared before Dai-ru 's very eyes .
当下 代儒 没法 ， 只得 料理 丧事 ， 各处 去 报 。,"Seeing that there was to be no redress , Dai-yu was obliged to set about preparing for the funeral and began by announcing his grandson 's death to everybody concerned ."
三日 起经 ， 七日 发引 ， 寄灵 铁槛 寺 后 。,Reading of the sutras began on the third day and on the seventh the coffin was drawn in procession to temporary lodging in the Temple of the Iron Threshold to await future reburial .
一时 贾家 众人 齐 来 吊 问 。,The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to offer their condolences .
荣府贾 赦赠 银 二十两 ， 贾政 也 是 二十两 ， 宁府 贾珍 亦 有 二十两 ， 其余 族 中 人 贫富 不 一 ， 或 一二两 ， 三四 两 ， 不等 。 外 又 有 各 同窗 家中 分资 ， 也 凑 了 二三十两 ：,From the Rong-guo side Jia She and Jia Zheng each gave twenty taels of silver and from the Ning-guo side Cousin Zhen also gave twenty taels . The other members of the clan gave amounts varying from one to four taels according to their means . A collection made among the parents of the dead man 's fellow-students raised an additional twenty or thirty taels .
代 儒家 道 虽然 淡薄 ， 得 此 帮助 ， 倒 也 丰 丰富 富 完 了 此事 。,"Although Dai-ru 's means were slender , with so much monetary help coming in he was able to perform the whole business in considerable style ."
谁知 这 年 冬底 ， 林如海 因为 身染重 疾 ， 写 书 来 特接 黛玉 回去 。,Towards the end of the year in which Jia Rui is troubles started Lin Ru-hai fell seriously ill and wrote a letter asking to see Dai-yu again .
贾母 听 了 ， 未免 又 加 忧闷 ， 只得 忙忙 的 打点 黛玉 起身 。,"Though Grandmother Jia was plunged into deepest gloom by the letter , she was obliged to prepare with all possible expedition for her granddaughter 's departure ."
宝玉 大 不自在 ， 争奈 父女之情 ， 也 不好 拦阻 。,"And Bao-yu , though he too was distressed at the prospect of Dai-yu 's leaving him , could scarcely seek to interfere in a matter affecting the natural feelings of a father and his child ."
于是 贾母 定 要 贾琏 送 他 去 ， 仍 叫 带 回来 。,Grandmother Jia insisted that Jia Lian should accompany Dai-yu and see her safely there and back .
一应 土仪 盘费 ， 不消 絮说 ， 自然 要 妥贴 的 。,"The various gifts to be taken and the journey-money were , it goes without saying , duly prepared ."
作速 择 了 日期 ， 贾琏 同着 黛玉 辞别 了 众人 ， 带领 仆从 ， 登舟 往 扬州 去 了 。,"A suitable day on which to commence the journey was quickly determined and Jia Lian and Dai-yu took leave of all the rest and , embarking with their attendants , set sail for Yangchow ."
要知 端的 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"If you wish for further details , you may learn them in the following chapter ."
第十三回,Chapter 13
秦可卿 死 封 龙禁尉,Qin-shi posthumously acquires the status of a Noble Dame
王熙凤 协理 宁国府,And Xi-feng takes on the management of a neighbouring establishment
话 说 凤姐儿 自 贾琏 送 黛玉 往 扬州 去后 ， 心中 实在 无趣 ， 每 到 晚间 ， 不过 同 平儿 说 笑 一回 就 胡乱 睡 了 。,"After Jia Lian 's departure for Yangchow Xi-feng felt bored and unhappy , particularly in the evenings when , apart from chatting with Patience , there seemed little to do but sleep ."
这日 夜间 和 平儿 灯 下 拥炉 ， 早 命 浓 熏 绣 被 ， 二人 睡 下 ， 屈指 计算 行程 该 到 何处 ， 不知不觉 已 交 三 鼓 。,"On the occasion of which we write she had sat beside the lamp with Patience until late into the evening ; then , the bedding having been well warmed , the two women had gone to bed , where they lay until after midnight discussing the stages of Jia Lian 's journey and attempting to calculate what point he was likely to have reached in it ."
平儿 已 睡熟 了 。 凤姐 方觉 睡眼 微蒙 ， 恍惚 只见 秦氏 从外 走进 来 ， 含笑 说道 ： “ 婶娘 好 睡 ！,"By this time Patience was fast asleep and Xi-feng herself was on the point of dropping off when she became dimly aware that Qin-shi had just walked into the room from outside . ' So fond of sleep , Auntie ? ' said Qin-shi with a gentle smile ."
我 今日 回去 ， 你 也 不 送 我 一程 。,' I shall have to begin my journey today without you to see me off .
因 娘儿们 素日 相好 ， 我 舍不得 婶娘 ， 故来别 你 一别 。,"But never mind ! Since you can not come to me , I have come to you instead . We two have always been so close , I could not have borne to leave you without saying good-bye ."
还有 一件 心愿 未了 ， 非 告诉 婶娘 ， 别人 未必 中 用 。 ”,"Besides , I have a last wish that you alone must hear , because I can not trust anyone else with it . '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 恍惚 问道 ： “ 有何 心愿 ？,' What is your wish ? ' Xi-feng heard herself asking .
只管 托 我 就是 了 。 ”,' You can trust me to carry it out for you . '
秦氏 道 ： “ 婶娘 ， 你 是 个 脂粉 队里 的 英雄 ， 连 那些 束带 顶冠 的 男子 也 不能 过 你 ， 你 如何 连 两句 俗语 也 不 晓得 ？,"' Tell me , Auntie , ' said Qin-shi , ' how is it that you who are such a paragon among women that even strong men find more than their match in you can yet be ignorant of the simple truths expressed in homely proverbs ?"
常言 ： ‘ 月满则亏 ， 水满 则 溢 ’ ， 又 道 是 ： ‘ 登高 必跌 重 ’ 。,"Take this one : The full moon smaller grows , Full water overflows . Or this : The hugher the climb , the harder the fall ."
如今 我们 家 赫赫扬扬 ， 已 将 百载 ， 一日 倘或 ‘ 乐极生悲 ’ ， 若 应 了 那 句 ‘ 树倒猢狲散 ’ 的 俗语 ， 岂 不 虚 称 了 一世 诗书 旧族 了 ？ ”,"Our house has now enjoyed nearly a century of dazzling success . Suppose one day "" joy at its height engenders sorrow "" . And suppose that , in the words of another proverb , "" when the tree falls , the monkeys scatter "" . Will not our reputation as one of the great , cultured households of the age then turn into a hollow mockery ? '"
凤姐 听 了 此话 ， 心胸 不快 ， 十分 敬畏 ， 忙 问道 ： “ 这话 虑 的 极 是 ， 但 有何 法 可以 永 保无虞 ？ ”,"Qin-shi 's question made Xi-feng feel uneasy , though at the same time inspiring a deep respect in her for her niece 's foresight . ' You are quite right to show concern , ' she said . ' Is there any means by which we can keep permanently out of danger ? '"
秦氏 冷笑 道 ： “ 婶娘 好 痴 也 ！,"' Now you are being silly , Auntie ! ' said Qin-shi somewhat scornfully ."
‘ 否极泰来 ’ ， 荣辱 自古 周而复始 ， 岂 人力 所能 常保 的 ， 但 如今 能 于荣 时筹画 下 将来 衰 时 的 世业 ， 亦 可以 常远 保全 了 。,"' "" The extreme of adversity is the beginning of prosperity "" - and the reverse of that saying is also true . Honour and disgrace follow each other in an unending cycle . No human power can arrest that cycle and hold it permanently in one position . What you can do , however , is to plan while we are still prosperous for the kind of heritage that will stand up to the hard times when they come . '"
即 如今 日 诸事 俱 妥 ， 只有 两件 未妥 ， 若 把 此事 如此 一行 ， 则 后日 可保 无 患 了 。 ”,"' At the moment everything seems well looked after ; but in fact there are still two matters that have not been properly taken care of . If you will deal with them in the way that I shall presently suggest , you will be able to face the future without fear of calamity . '"
凤姐 便 问道 ： “ 什么 事 ？ ”,' What two matters ? ' Xi-feng asked her .
秦氏 道 ： “ 目今 祖茔 虽 四时 祭祀 ， 只是 无 一定 的 钱粮 ；,"' Though the seasonal offerings at the ancestral burial-ground are at present regularly attended to , ' said Qin-shi , no special income has been set aside to pay for them . That is the first matter ."
第二 ， 家塾 虽 立 ， 无 一定 的 供给 。,"The second matter concerns the clan school . There again , there is no fixed source of income ."
依 我 想来 ， 如今 盛时 固不缺 祭祀 供给 ， 但 将来 败落 之 时 ， 此 二项 有何 出处 ？,"Obviously there will be no lack of funds either for the seasonal offerings or for the school as long as we enjoy our present prosperity . But where is the money for them coming from in the future , when the family has fallen on hard times ?"
莫若 依 我 定见 ， 趁 今日 富贵 ， 将 祖茔 附近 多 置 田庄 、 房舍 、 地 亩 ， 以备 祭祀 、 供给 之 费 皆 出自 此处 ； 将 家塾 亦 设于 此 ； 合同 族 中 长幼 ， 大家 定 了 则例 ， 日后 按 房 掌管 这 一年 的 地亩 钱粮 、 祭祀 供给 之 事 。,"' I am convinced that the only way of dealing with these two matters is to invest now , while we are still rich and powerful , in as much property as possible - land , farms , and houses - in the area around the burial-ground , and to pay for the seasonal offerings and the running of the school entirely out of the income from this property . Moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it . The whole clan , old and young alike , should be convened and a set of regulations drawn up whereby each family is made to administer the estate and look after the financing of the seasonal offerings and the clan school for one year in turn ."
如此 周流 ， 又 无 争竞 ， 也 没有 典卖 诸 弊 。,By making the responsibility rotate in a fixed order you will remove the possibility of quarrels about it and also lessen the danger of the property getting mortgaged or sold .
便是 有罪 ， 己物 可以 入 官 ， 这 祭祀 产业 ， 连官 也 不入 的 。,"' Then even if the clan gets into trouble and its possessions are confiscated , this part of its property , as charitable estate , will escape confiscation ;"
便 败落 下来 ， 子孙 回家 读书 务农 ， 也 有 个 退步 ， 祭祀 又 可 永继 。,"and when the family 's fortunes are in decline , it will be a place where the young people can go to farm and study , as well as a means of maintaining the ancestral sacrifices in unbroken succession ."
若 目今 以为 荣华 不 绝 ， 不思 后日 ， 终非 长策 。,To refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our present prosperity is going to last for ever would be extremely short-sighted .
眼见 不日 又 有 一件 非常 的 喜事 ， 真是 烈火烹油 、 鲜花 着 锦之盛 。 一 要 知道 也 不过 是 瞬息 的 繁华 ， 一时 的 欢乐 ， 万 不可 忘 了 那 ‘ 盛筵必散 ’ 的 俗语 。,"' Quite soon a happy event is going to take place in this family , bringing it an even greater glory than it has enjoyed up to now . But it will be a glory as excessive and as transitory as a posy of fresh flowers pinned to an embroidered dress or the flare-up of spilt cooking-oil on a blazing fire . In the midst of that brief moment of happiness never forget that "" even the best party must have an end "" ."
若 不 早为 后虑 ， 只恐 后悔 无益 了 ！ ”,"For if you do , and if you fail to take precautions in good time , you will live to regret it bitterly when it is already too late . '"
凤姐 忙 问 ： “ 有何 喜事 ？ ”,' What is this happy event you speak of ? ' Xi-feng asked her eagerly .
秦氏 道 ： “ 天机不可 泄漏 。,' That is a secret which may not be revealed to mortal ears .
只是 我 与 婶娘 好 了 一场 ， 临别 赠 你 两句话 ， 须要 记 着 ！ ”,"However , for the sake of our brief friendship on this earth , I leave you these words as my parting gift . Be sure that you remember them well !"
因 念道 ：,
三 春去 后 诸芳 尽 ，,"When the Three Springs have gone , the flowering time will end ,"
各自 须 寻 各自 门 。,And each one for himself as best he may must fend . '
凤姐 还 欲 问 时 ， 只 听 二门 上 传出 云板 ， 连 叩 四下 ， 正是 丧音 ， 将 凤姐 惊醒 ， 人 回 ： “ 东府 蓉 大 奶奶 没 了 。 ”,"Xi-feng was about to ask her another question when she was interrupted by the sound of the iron chime-bar which hung in the inner gate . Four strokes . The signal of death ! She woke with a start to hear a servant announcing , ' Mrs Rong of the Ning-guo mansion is dead . '"
凤姐 吓 了 一身 冷汗 ， 出 了 一回 神 ， 只得 忙 穿衣服 往 王夫人 处来 。,A cold sweat broke out over her body and for a while she lay too stunned to move . Then forcing herself to get up she pulled on her clothes and went round to Lady Wang 's .
彼时 合家 皆知 ， 无不 纳闷 ， 都 有些 伤心 。,By this time the entire household had heard the news . All seemed bewildered by it and all were in one way or another deeply distressed .
那 长 一辈 的 ， 想 他 素日 孝顺 ； 平辈 的 ， 想 他 素日 和睦 亲密 ； 下一辈 的 ， 想 他 素日 慈爱 ； 以及 家中 仆从 老小 ， 想 他 素日 怜贫惜贱 、 爱老慈幼 之 恩 ， 莫不 悲号 痛哭 。,"Those older than Qin-shi thought of how dutiful she had always been ; those in her own generation thought of her warmth and friendliness ; her juniors remembered how kindly and lovingly she had treated them ; even the servants , irrespective of sex and age , remembering her compassion for the poor and humble and her gentle concern for the old and the very young , all wept and lamented as loud and bitterly as the rest ."
闲 言少叙 ， 却说 宝玉 因 近日 林黛玉 回去 ， 剩得 自己 落单 ， 也 不 和 人 玩耍 ， 每 到 晚间 ， 便 索然 睡 了 。,"But we digress . During the last few days , since Dai-yu 's return to her father had deprived him of her companionship , Bao-yu , far from seeking diversion in the company of the others , had kept to himself , going to bed early every night and sleeping disconsolately on his own ."
如今 从 梦 中 听见 说 秦氏 死 了 ， 连忙 翻身 爬起来 ， 只 觉 心中 似 戳 了 一刀 的 ， 不觉 的 “ 哇 ” 的 一声 ， 直 喷出 一口 血 来 。,"The news of Qin-shi 's death came to him in the midst of his dreams , causing him to start up in bed with a jerk . A sudden stabbing pain shot through his heart . He retched involuntarily and spat out a mouthful of blood ."
袭 人 等 慌慌忙忙 上来 扶 着 ， 问 ： “ 是 怎么样 的 ？ ”,"Aroma and the maids clung to him , terrified , and asked him what was the matter ."
又 要 回 贾母 去 请 大夫 。 宝玉 道 ： “ 不用 忙 ， 不相干 。,"They wanted to tell Grandmother Jia and ask her to send for a doctor ; but Bao-yu would not hear of it . ' Do not worry , its of no consequence ! ' he told them ."
这 是 急火攻心 ， 血不归 经 。 ”,' Something that happens when a sudden rush of fire to the heart prevents the blood from getting back into the right channels . '
说 着 便 爬起来 ， 要 衣服 换 了 ， 来 见 贾母 ， 即时 要 过去 。,"He climbed out of bed as he spoke and told them to bring him some clean clothes , so that he could see his grandmother and then go straight on to the other house ."
袭 人 见 他 如此 ， 心中 虽 放不下 ， 又 不敢 拦阻 ， 只得 由 他 罢了 。,"Aroma was still concerned for him , but seeing him so determined , allowed him to have his way ."
贾母 见 他 要 去 ， 因说 ： “ 才 咽气 的 人 ， 那里 不 干净 ； 二则 夜里 风 大 ， 等 明早 再 去 不迟 。 ”,"Grandmother Jia did not want him to go , either . ' It will not be clean there , ' she said , ' with her scarcely yet cold . And besides , there is a nasty wind at this time of night . It will be soon enough if you go there first thing tomorrow . '"
宝玉 那里 肯依 。 贾母命 人 备车 多派 跟 从 人役 ， 拥护 前来 。,"But Bao-yu would not be gainsaid , so she gave instructions for a carriage to be made ready for him and a numerous retinue of servants to attend him there ."
一直 到 了 宁国府 前 ， 只见 府 门 大 开 ， 两边 灯火 ， 照如 白昼 ， 乱烘烘 人来人往 ； 里面 哭声 摇 山振岳 。,"Arriving in haste at the entrance of the Ning-guo mansion , they found the gates flung wide open and lanterns on either side turning the night into noonday . Despite the hour , a multitude of people were hurrying through it in both directions , while from inside the house issued a sound of lamentation that seemed to shake the very buildings to their foundations ."
宝玉 下 了 车 ， 忙忙 奔至 停灵 之 室 ， 痛哭 一番 ， 然后 见 过 尤氏 。 — — 谁知 尤氏 正犯 了 胃气 疼 的 旧症 ， 睡 在 床上 。,"Alighting from his carriage , Bao-yu hurried through to the room in which Qin-shi lay and wept there for a while very bitterly . He then went to call on You-shi , whom he found ill in bed , struck down by a sudden attack of some gastric trouble from which she had occasionally suffered in the past ."
— — 然后 又 出来 见 贾珍 。,"After leaving You-shi , he went to look for Cousin Zhen ."
彼时 贾代儒 、 代修 、 贾敕 、 贾效 、 贾敦 、 贾 赦 、 贾政 、 贾琮 、 贾 㻞 、 贾珩 、 贾 珖 、 贾琛 、 贾琼 、 贾 璘 、 贾蔷 、 贾 菖 、 贾菱 、 贾芸 、 贾芹 、 贾 藁 、 贾萍 、 贾藻 、 贾蘅 、 贾芬 、 贾芳 、 贾蓝 、 贾菌 、 贾芝 等 都 来 了 。 贾珍 哭 的 泪人 一般 ， 正 和 贾代儒 等 说道 ： “ 合家 大小 ， 远近 亲友 ， 谁 不知 我 这 媳妇 比 儿子 还 强 十倍 。,"By now Jia Dai-ru , Jia Dai-xiu , Jia Chi , Jia Xiao , Jia Dun , Jia She , Jia Zheng , Jia Cong , Jia Bin , Jia Heng ( I ) , Jia Guang , Jia Chen , Jia Qiong , Jia Lin , Jia Qiang , Jia Chang , Jia Ling , Jia Yun , Jia Qin , Jia Jin , Jia Ping , Jia Zao , Jia Heng ( II ) , Jia Fen , Jia Fang , Jia Lan , Jia Jun and Jia Zhi had all arrived , and Bao-yu found Cousin Zhen in their midst addressing them , though well-nigh choked with tears : ' Everyone , young or old , kinsman or friend , knows that my daughter-in-law was ten times better than any son ."
如今 伸腿 去 了 ， 可见 这 长房 内 绝灭 无人 了 ！ ” 说 着 又 哭 起来 。,Now that she has been taken from us it is plain to see that this senior branch of the family is doomed to extinction ! ' and he broke down once more into incontrollable weeping .
众人 劝道 ： “ 人 已 辞世 ， 哭 也 无益 ， 且 商议 如何 料理 要紧 。 ”,"The men present tried to console him : ' Now that she is gone , crying is not going to bring her back again . The important thing now is to make your plans for the funeral . '"
贾珍 拍手 道 ： “ 如何 料理 ！,"' Plans ? What plans ? ' Cousin Zhen cried , somewhat theatrically ."
不过 尽 我 所有 罢了 ！ ”,Just take everything I have - everything ! '
正说 着 ， 只见 秦邦业 、 秦钟 、 尤氏 几个 眷属 尤氏姊妹 也 都 来 了 。,"As he was speaking Qin Bang-ye and Qin Zhong arrived , and various members of You-shi 's family , including her two younger sisters ."
贾珍便 命 贾琼 、 贾琛 、 贾 璘 、 贾蔷 四个 人 去 陪客 ， 一面 吩咐 去 请 钦 天监 阴阳 司来 择日 。,"Cousin Zhen deputed Jia Qiong , Jia Chen , Jia Lin and Jia Qiang from among the younger men present to look after them and any other guests who might arrive . He also instructed someone to invite an expert from the Board of Astronomy to select dates for the funeral and the ceremonies preceding it ."
择准 停灵 七七四十九日 ， 三日 后 开 丧送 讣闻 。,With the approval of this official it was decided that the lying in state should be for forty-nine days and that the notification of bereavement indicating the family 's readiness to receive official visits of condolence should be made in three days ' time .
这 四十九日 ， 单 请 一百零八 众 僧人 在 大厅 上拜 “ 大悲 忏 ” ， 超度 前亡 后 死 鬼魂 ； 另 设 一坛 于 天香楼 ， 是 九十九 位 全真道 土 ， 打 十九日 解冤 洗业 醮 。,"A hundred and eight Buddhist monks were engaged to perform a Grand Misericordia for the salvation of all departed souls in the main reception hall of the mansion during these forty-nine days , while at the same time ninety-nine Taoist priests of the Quanzhen sect were to perform ceremonies of purification and absolution at a separate altar in the Celestial Fragrance pavilion . These arrangements having been made , the body was moved to a temporary shrine in another pavilion of the All-scents Garden ."
然后 停灵 于会芳 园中 ， 灵前 另外 五十 众 高僧 ， 五十 位 高 道 ， 对坛 按 七 作 好事 。,Fifty high-ranking Buddhist monks and fifty high-ranking Taoist priests took turns in chanting and intoning before it on every seventh day .
那 贾敬闻 得长 孙媳妇 死 了 ， 因 自为 早晚 就要 飞升 ， 如何 肯 又 回家 染 了 红尘 ， 将 前功尽弃 呢 ， 故此 并 不在意 ， 只 凭 贾珍 料理 。,Nothing would induce old Jia Jing to return home when he learned of the death of his grandson 's wife . Immortality was within his grasp and he was not going to impair his hard-won sanctity with the taint of earthly pollution . Accordingly he left all these matters to Cousin Zhen to order as he wished .
且说 贾珍 恣意 奢华 ， 看 板 时 ， 几副 杉木 板 皆 不中意 。,"Free to indulge his own extravagant tastes , Cousin Zhen had inspected several sets of deal coffin-boards without finding any to his liking ."
可巧 薛蟠 来 吊 ， 因见 贾珍 寻好 板 ， 便 说 ： “ 我们 木 店里 有 一副 板 ， 说 是 铁网 山上 出 的 ， 作 了 棺材 ， 万年 不坏 的 。,"Xue Pan heard of his problem when he came round to condole . ' We have got a set in our timber-yard , he told Cousin Zhen . ' It is in a wood supposed to have come from the Iron Net Mountains . They say that a coffin made from it will last for ever without rotting ."
这 还是 当年 先父 带来 的 ， 原系 忠义 亲王 老 千岁 要 的 ， 因 他 坏 了 事 ， 就 不曾 用 。,"It was brought here years ago by my father . Prince Zhong-yi was going to have it , but when he came unstuck it did not get used ."
现在 还封 在 店里 ， 也 没有 人 买得起 。,It is still locked up in store because no one has ever been found who could afford to buy it .
你 若 要 ， 就 抬来 看看 。 ”,"If you are interested , I can have it carried round for you to look at ."
贾珍 听说 甚 喜 ， 即命 抬来 ， 大家 看 时 ， 只见 帮底 皆 厚 八寸 ， 纹 若 槟榔 ， 味 若 檀 麝 ， 以 手扣 之 ， 声 如 玉石 。,"Cousin Zhen was delighted , and the timber was brought over at once for everyone to inspect . The planks for the base and sides were at least eight inches thick . The wood had a grain like areca palm and a fragrance suggestive of musk and sandalwood . When rapped with the knuckles it gave off a hard , ringing sound like jade or stone ."
大家 称奇 。 贾珍笑 问道 ： “ 价值 几何 ？ ”,Everyone was impressed and Cousin Zhen eagerly inquired the price .
薛蟠笑 道 ： “ 拿 着 一千两 银子 只怕 没 处买 ； 什么 价不价 ， 赏 他们 几两 银子 作 工钱 就是 了 。 ”,"Xue Pan laughed . ' I doubt you could buy a set like this for a thousand taels of silver cash down , ' he said . ' Blow the price ! Give the workmen a couple of taels for carrying it here and it is yours . '"
贾珍 听说 ， 连忙 道谢 不尽 ， 即命 解锯 造成 。,Cousin Zhen thanked him profusely and at once gave orders for the planks to be sawn up and made into a coffin .
贾政因 劝道 ： “ 此物 恐 非常 人 可享 ； 殓 以上 等 杉木 也罢 了 。 ” 贾珍 如何 肯听 。,Jia Zheng doubted the propriety of using such material for the burial of a person not of royal blood and insisted that it would be sufficient to use the best quality deal ; but Cousin Zhen refused to listen .
忽 又 听见 秦氏 之 丫鬟 名唤 瑞珠 的 ， 见 秦氏 死 了 ， 也 触柱而亡 。,"News was suddenly brought that Qin-shi 's little maid Gem , on hearing that her mistress was dead , had taken her own life by dashing her head against a pillar ."
此事 更为 可罕 ， 合族 都 称叹 。,Such rare devotion excited the wondering admiration of the entire clan .
贾珍遂 以 孙女 之 礼 殡殓 之 ， 一并 停灵 于会芳 园 之 登 仙 阁 。,Cousin Zhen at once had her laid out and encoffined with the rites appropriate to a granddaughter and ordered her coffin to be placed in the Ascension Pavilion of the All-scents Garden side by side with Qin-shi 's .
又 有 小 丫环 名 宝珠 的 ， 因 秦氏 无出 ， 乃 愿为 义女 ， 请 任 摔 丧驾灵 之 任 。,"As Qin-shi had died without issue , another of her little maids called Jewel volunteered to stand in as her daughter and perform the chief mourner 's duties of smashing the bowl when the bearers came in to take up the coffin and walking in front of it in the funeral procession ."
贾珍 甚 喜 ， 即时 传命 ， 从此 皆 呼 宝珠 为 “ 小姑娘 ” 。,Cousin Zhen was very pleased and gave orders that thenceforth everyone was to address her as ' Miss Jewel ' just as if she were Qin-shi 's real daughter .
那 宝珠 按 未嫁 女 之 礼 在 灵前 哀哀欲绝 。,"In the meantime she installed herself by the coffin and , comporting herself in the manner prescribed for an unmarried daughter , wept and wailed until she had almost lost her voice ."
于是 合 族人 并 家下 诸人 都 各 遵 旧制 行事 ， 自 不得 错乱 。,"Following these preliminaries , the rest of the clan together with the family servants all proceeded to carry out their mourning duties according to long-established precedents and in a correct and orderly manner ."
贾珍 因 想道 ： “ 贾蓉 不过 是 黄门 监生 ， 灵幡 上 写 时 不 好看 ； 便是 执事 也 不 多 。 ” 因此 ， 心下 甚 不自在 。,"The family 's respect for tradition was , however , a source of great unease to Cousin Zhen when he reflected on Jia Rong 's status : for Jia Rong was only an Imperial College Student - an absurdly insignificant title to write on a funeral banner ; and the insignia to which Qin-shi was entitled would make a very poor showing when borne in the funeral procession ."
可巧 这日 正是 首七 第四日 ， 早 有 大明宫 掌 宫内 监 戴权 ， 先备 了 祭礼 遣 人 来 ， 次 后坐 了 大 轿 ， 打 道 鸣锣 ， 亲来上 祭 。,"By a stroke of luck the fourth day of the first seven-day period - the day on which official condolences were scheduled to begin - brought a visit from Dai Quan , the Eunuch Chamberlain of the Da-ming Palace . Having sent his representative along well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit , he presently arrived himself , seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the streets before him , to present his offerings in person ."
贾珍忙 接待 ， 让 坐至 逗 蜂 轩献茶 。,"Cousin Zhen at once made up his mind to take advantage of the visit . As soon as Dai Quan had made his offering , Cousin Zhen ushered him into the Honey Bee Gallery , invited him to be seated , and served him with tea ."
贾珍 心中 早 打定主意 ， 因而 趁便 就 说 要 与 贾蓉 捐 个 前程 的话 。,"Then , entering into conversation with his guest , he quickly found occasion to mention the fact that he was thinking of purchasing a place for his son Jia Rong ."
戴权 会意 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 想 是 为 丧礼 上 风光 些 ？ ”,"The eunuch guessed what was in his mind , and laughingly inquired whether it was not with a view to adding a little pomp to the funeral that he had conceived this notion ."
贾珍忙 道 ： “ 老内相 所 见 不 差 。 ”,"' My dear Chamberlain , ' Cousin Zhen readily agreed , ' you have hit the nail on the head ! '"
戴权 道 ： “ 事 倒 凑巧 ， 正 有 个 美缺 ：,"' Well , by a lucky coincidence , ' said Dai Quan , ' there is rather a good place going at this very moment ."
如今 三百员 龙禁尉 缺 了 两员 ， 昨儿 襄阳 侯 的 兄弟 老三 来求 我 ， 现 拿 了 一千五百两 银子 送到 我 家里 ；,"The Corps of Officers of the Imperial Guard , which has an establishment of three hundred , has got two vacancies in it . Yesterday Lord Xiang-yang 's younger brother ' Sannikins ' begged me for one of them and sent fifteen hundred taels of silver round to my house to pay for it ."
你 知道 ， 咱们 都 是 老相好 ， 不拘 怎么样 ， 看着 他 爷爷 的 分上 ， 胡乱 应 了 。,"He and I have always been good friends , as you know , and in any case I felt I had to do something , for his Grandpa 's sake ; so I could not very well refuse ."
还 剩 了 一个 缺 。 谁知 永兴 节度使 冯 胖子 要求 与 他 孩子 捐 ， 我 就 没工夫 应 他 。,"' Piggy ' Feng , the Military Governor of Yong-xing , has asked me if he can buy the remaining place for his son , but I haven ' t yet had time to give him a reply ."
既 是 咱们 的 孩子 要 捐 ， 快 写 个 履历 来 。 ”,"If our young friend here wants it , why not jot down his particulars and I will see what I can do . '"
贾珍忙 命人 写 了 一张 红纸 履历 来 。,"Cousin Zhen at once ordered someone to write out Jia Rong 's name , age and lineage on a sheet of red paper ."
戴权 看 了 ， 上 写 着 ：,The following description was hurriedly prepared and handed to Dai Quan for his inspection :
江南 应 天府 江宁县 监生 贾蓉 ， 年 二十岁 。,Name : JIA RONG Place of Origin : ( County ) Kiangning ; ( Prefecture ) Ying-tian-fu ; ( Province ) Kiangnan . Status : Imperial College Student Age : 20
曾祖 ， 原 任京营 节度使 世袭 一等 神威 将军 贾代化 。,"Great-grandfather : General Jia Dai-hua , C . - in-C. Metropolitan Barracks , hereditary noble of the first rank ."
祖 ， 丙辰 科 进士 贾敬 。,"Grandfather : Jia Jing , Palace Graduate of the year 17 - ."
父 ， 世袭 三品 爵 威烈 将军 贾珍 。,"Father : Hon . Colonel Jia Zhen , third rank ( hereditary ) ."
戴权 看 了 ， 回手 递 与 一个 贴身 的 小厮 收 了 ， 道 ： “ 回去 送与 户部 堂 官 老 赵 ， 说 我 拜 上 他 起 一张 五品 龙禁尉 的 票 ， 再 给 个 执照 ， 就 把 这 履历 填 上 。,"After glancing through it quickly , Dai Quan handed it into the keeping of a young eunuch secretary at his side . ' When we get back , ' he said to the latter , ' give this to old Zhao , the President of the Board of Revenue , with my compliments , and ask him if he would kindly make out a commission for a captain in the Imperial Guard , fifth rank , and also the papers to go with it with these particulars filled in ."
明日 我 来 兑 银子 送 过去 。 ”,Tell him I will call round tomorrow to pay in the money . '
小厮 答应 了 。 戴权 告辞 ， 贾珍 款留 不住 ， 只得 送出 府门 。,"The young eunuch bowed , and Dai Quan rose to go . Seeing that he could no longer detain him , Cousin Zhen showed him out as far as the main gate ."
临上 轿 ， 贾珍 问 ： “ 银子 还是 我 到 部 去 兑 ， 还是 送入 内 相府 中 ？ ”,"As the eunuch was getting into his palanquin , Cousin Zhen asked him whether he should take the money to the Ministry or bring it round to Dai Quan 's own house ."
戴权 道 ： “ 若 到 部里 兑 ， 你 又 吃亏 了 ， 不如 平准 一千两 银子 送到 我家 就 完 了 。 ”,"' Better bring a thousand taels , standard weight , to my house . If you go to the Ministry , they are sure to fleece you . '"
贾珍 感谢 不尽 ， 说 ： “ 待 服满 ， 亲带 小犬 到 府 叩谢 。 ”,"Cousin Zhen thanked him warmly . ' When the period of mourning is over , he said , ' I shall bring the young fellow round to your house to kotow his thanks . '"
于是 作别 。,With that they parted .
接着 又 听 喝道 之 声 ， 原来 是 忠 靖侯史 鼎 的 夫人 ， 带 着 侄女 史湘云 来 了 。,"But no sooner had the eunuch gone than the sound of criers was once more heard in the street , this time heralding the arrival of the Marchioness of Zhong-Jing , wife of Grandmother Jia is nephew Shi Ding , with her little niece Shi Xiang-yun ."
王夫人 、 邢夫人 、 凤姐 等 刚 迎 人 正房 ， 又 见 锦乡 侯 、 川宁侯 、 寿山 伯 三家 祭礼 也 摆在 灵前 ； 少时 ， 三 人 下 轿 ， 贾珍 接上 大厅 。,"Lady Wang , Lady Xing and Wang Xi-feng received them in Cousin Zhen 's drawing-room ."
如此 亲朋 你 来 我 去 ， 也 不能 计数 。,"Offerings from the Marquises of Jin-xiang and Chuan-ning and the Earl of Shou-shan were now on display , and those three gentlemen were shortly to be observed alighting from their palanquins outside . Cousin Zhen went out to meet them and conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall ."
只 这 四十九日 ， 宁国府 街上 一条 白 漫漫 人来人往 ， 花 簇簇 官 去 官 来 。,"From then on there was a continuous stream of arrivals , and throughout the whole forty-nine-day period the street in front of the Ning-guo mansion was thronged with family mourners in white and mandarins in their colourful robes of office , milling in and out and to and fro all day long ."
贾珍 令 贾蓉 次日 换 了 吉服 ， 领凭 回来 。,The day after Dai Quan 's visit Cousin Zhen made Jia Rong change out of mourning into a court dress and go to collect his commission .
灵前 供用 执事 等 物 俱 按 五品 职例 ， 灵牌 疏 上 皆 写 “ 诰授 贾门 秦氏 宜人 之 灵位 ” 。,The furnishings and insignia in the shrine were all rearranged in a manner befitting a person of the fifth rank . The wording on the spirit tablet which stood on the table of offerings at the foot of the coffin now read : Spirit tablet of the Lady Qin-shi of the Jia family Gentlewoman of the Fifth Rank by Imperial Patent
会 芳园 临街 大门 洞开 ， 两边 起 了 鼓乐 厅 ， 两班 青衣 按时 奏乐 ； 一对对 执事 摆 的 刀斩斧 截 。,"The gate of the All-scents Garden opening on to the street was thrown wide open and booths for musicians were erected on either side of it , in which black-coated funeral bands played at fixed times throughout the day . To either side of them were displayed the insignia of rank : glittering rows of axes and halberds arranged in wooden stands ."
更 有 两面 朱红 销金 大牌 竖 在 门外 ， 上面 大 书道 ： “ 防护 内廷紫 禁道 御 前 侍卫 龙禁尉 ” 。,"At each side of the gateway vermilion-painted boards inscribed in large golden characters boldly announced the status of the bereaved : Honorary Captain of the Imperial Bodyguard Inner Palace , Northern Capital Division"
对面 高 起 着 宣坛 ， 僧道 对坛 ； 榜 上 大书 “ 世袭 宁国 公冢孙 妇 防护 内廷 御 前 侍卫 龙禁尉 贾门 秦氏 宜人 ” 之 丧 。,"Inside the gateway , facing the street , a high staging was constructed on which Buddhist monks and Taoist priests sat on opposite sides of an altar intoning their sacred texts . In front of the staging was a notice on which was written in large characters : FUNERAL OBSEQUIES THE LADY QIN-SHI Senior great-great-granddaughter-in-law of Jia Yan , Hereditary Duke of Ning-guo , and wife of the Right Honourable Jia Rong , Captain in the Imperial Bodyguard , Inner Palace :"
四大部 洲 至 中 之 地 ， 奉天 永建 太平 之 国 ，,"WHEREAS in this favoured Country , situate in the centre-most part of the tour continents of the earth , on which it has pleased Heaven to bestow the blessings of everlasting prosperity and peace ,"
总理 虚无 寂静 沙门 僧录 司正堂 万 〈 虚 〉 、 总理 元始 正一教 门道 纪 司正堂 叶 〈 生 〉 等 ，,"WE , The Very Reverend Wan-Xu , Co-President of the Board of Commissioners having authority over all monks and clergy of the Incorporeal , Ever-tranquil Church of the Lord Buddha , the Venerable Ye-sheng , Co-President of the Board of Commissioners having authority over all priests and practitioners of the Primordial , All-unifying Church of the Heavenly Tao ,"
敬谨修 斋 ， 朝 天 叩 佛 ”,"HAVE , with all due reverence and care , prepared offices for the salvation of all departed souls , supplicating Heaven and calling upon the Name of the Lord Buddha ..."
以及 “ 恭请 诸 ‘ 伽蓝 ’ 、 ‘ 揭谛 ’ 、 ‘ 功 曹 ’ 等 神 ， 圣恩 普锡 ， 神威 远振 ， 四十九日 销灾 洗业 平安 水陆 道场 ” 等 语 ， 亦 不及 繁记 。,"NOW , earnestly praying and beseeching the Eighteen Guardians of the Sangha , the Warlike Guardians of the Law , and the Twelve Guardians of the Months mercifully to extend their holy compassion towards us , but terribly to blaze forth in divine majesty against the powers of evil , we do solemnly perform for nine and forty days the Great Mass tor the purification , deliverance and salvation of all souls on land and on sea . . . - and a great deal more on those lines which it would be tedious to repeat ."
只是 贾珍 虽然 心意 满足 ， 但 里面 尤氏 又 犯 了 旧疾 ， 不能 料理 事务 ， 惟恐 各 诰命 来往 ， 亏了 礼数 ， 怕人 笑话 ， 因此 心中 不自在 。,"Although Cousin Zhen now had every reason to feel satisfied with his arrangements , there was still one matter which caused him uneasiness . You-shi 's unfortunate illness meant that she was unable to discharge any of her social obligations , and he was mortally afraid that with so many great ladies coming to the house on visits of condolence , some breach of etiquette might occur which would cause the family to look ridiculous ."
当下 正 忧虑 时 ， 因 宝玉 在 侧 ， 便 问道 ： “ 事事 都 算 安贴 了 ， 大 哥哥 还 愁 什么 ？ ”,"Bao-yu once chanced to be sitting next to him when his mind was dwelling on this problem , and observing the gloomy and preoccupied expression on his cousin 's face , asked him why he should still be worried now that everything had been so excellently taken care of ."
贾珍便 将 里面 无人 的话 告诉 了 他 。,Cousin Zhen explained that it was the present lack of a responsible female head of household which was the cause of his concern .
宝玉 听说 ， 笑 道 ： “ 这 有 何难 ， 我 荐 一个 人 与 你 ， 权理 这 一个月 的 事 ， 管保 妥当 ！ ”,"' That is no problem ! ' said Bao-yu encouragingly . ' I know just the person for this . Put her in temporary control here for a month , and I guarantee that you will have nothing further to worry about . '"
贾珍忙 问 ： “ 是 谁 ？ ”,' Who ? ' inquired Cousin Zhen eagerly .
宝玉 见 坐间 还有 许多 亲友 ， 不便 明言 ， 走 向贾珍 耳边 说 了 两句 。,"Bao-yu deemed it imprudent to mention her name out loud in the hearing of so many friends and relations , so leaning across he whispered it in Cousin Zhen is ear ."
贾珍 听 了 ， 喜不自胜 ， 笑 道 ： “ 这 果然 妥贴 。,"Cousin Zhen 's reaction was ecstatic . ' Yes , absolutely the right person ! ' he cried ."
如今 就 去 。 ”,' Let's see about it straight away ! '
说 着 ， 拉 了 宝玉 ， 辞 了 众人 ， 便 往 上 房里 来 。,"And seizing Bao-yu by the hand , he excused himself to the company and hurried round to the reception room in his own apartment ."
可巧 这日 非 正经 日期 ， 亲友 来 的 少 ， 里面 不过 几位 近亲 堂客 ， 邢夫人 、 王夫人 、 凤姐 并合 族 中 的 内眷 陪 坐 。,"It so happened that this day was not one of the seven on which masses were said , so visitors from outside the family were fairly few . In the inner apartments there was only a handful of lady visitors , all of them close connections of the Jia family , whom Lady Xing , Lady Wang , Wang Xi-feng and various female members of the clan were keeping company ."
闻人 报 “ 大爷 进来 了 。 ” 唬 的 众 婆娘 “ 嗯 ” 的 一声 ， 往后 藏 之 不迭 ； 独凤姐 款款 站 了 起来 。,"When a servant announced ' The Master is here ' , all these females jumped up with little shrieks of alarm and rushed off to hide themselves - all , that is , except Xi-feng , who rose slowly to her feet and imperturbably stood her ground ."
贾珍 此时 也 有些 病症 在 身 ， 二则 过于 悲痛 ， 因 拄 个 拐 踱 了 进来 ， 邢夫人 等 因 说道 ： “ 你 身上 不好 ， 又 连日 多 事 ， 该 歇歇 才 是 ， 又 进来 做 什么 ？ ”,"Cousin Zhen had of late been feeling far from well . The debility his sickness caused him had been further aggravated by excessive grief and obliged him to support himself with a staff . Lady Xing was concerned to see the pitiful figure he presented as he entered the room . ' You are not well , ' she said , ' and you have been doing too much now for days . You ought to be getting some rest . What do you want to come in here for ? '"
贾珍 一面 拄 拐 ， 扎挣 着要 蹲身 跪下 请安 道乏 ； 邢夫人 等 忙 叫 宝玉 搀住 ， 命人 撤 椅子 与 他 坐 。,"Clutching his staff in his hand , Cousin Zhen struggled down on to his knees , and having made his duty to his aunts , began thanking them for all their trouble . Lady Xing hurriedly ordered Bao-yu to raise him up and commanded a chair to be moved forward for him to sit on ."
贾珍 不肯 坐 ， 因 勉强 陪笑 道 ： “ 侄儿 进来 有 一件 事 要求 二位 婶娘 、 大 妹妹 。 ”,"But Cousin Zhen refused to be seated . ' I have come to ask you three ladies a favour , ' he said , forcing his woebegone features into a smile ."
邢夫人 等 忙 问 ： “ 什么 事 ？ ”,' What is it you want ? ' Lady Xing asked him .
贾珍忙 说道 ： “ 婶娘 自然 知道 ： 如今 孙子 媳妇 没 了 ， 侄儿 媳妇 又 病倒 ， 我 看 里头 着实 不成体统 ； 要 屈尊 大 妹妹 一个月 ， 在 这里 料理 料理 ， 我 就 放心 了 。 ”,"' As you doubtless know , ' said Cousin Zhen , ' my wife has been ill in bed ever since our daughter-in-law 's death , and with no one to run her side of the household it has been getting into a pretty deplorable state . I should like to ask Cousin Feng if she could possibly see her way to running things here for us during the coming month . It would be a great relief to me if she could . '"
邢夫人 笑 道 ： “ 原来 为 这个 。 你 大 妹妹 现在 你 二婶 娘家 ， 只 和 你 二 婶娘 说 就是 了 。 ”,' So that is what you want ! ' said Lady Xing with a smile . ' Feng is now part of your Aunt Wang is establishment . You would better talk to her about it . '
王夫人 忙 道 ： “ 他 一个 小孩子 ， 何曾 经过 这些 事 ， 倘或 料理 不 清 ， 反叫 人 笑话 ， 倒 是 再 烦 别人 好 。 ”,"' She is only a child yet ; you know , ' Lady Wang put in hastily . ' What experience has she ever had of this kind of thing ? Suppose she proved not quite up to the task . We should all be made to look ridiculous . I think you had better trouble someone else . '"
贾珍笑 道 ： “ 婶娘 的 意思 ， 侄儿 猜着 了 ： 是 怕 大 妹妹 劳苦 了 。,"' I can easily guess what is in your mind , Aunt , ' said Cousin Zhen . ' You are afraid we should overwork her ."
若 说 料理 不 开 ， 从小儿 大 妹妹 玩笑 时 就 有 杀伐 决断 ， 如今 出 了 阁 ， 在 那 府 里 办事 ， 越发 历练老成 了 。,"For I assure you there is no question of her not being a good enough manager . Even in her childhood games , Cousin Feng had the decisiveness of a little general , and since she is married and had some experience of running things next door , she is a thoroughly seasoned campaigner ."
我 想 了 这 几日 ， 除了 大 妹妹 再 无人 可求 了 。,I have thought the matter over carefully these past few days and am quite convinced that apart from Cousin Feng there really is not anyone else I can ask .
婶娘 不 看 侄儿 和 侄儿 媳妇 面上 ， 只 看死 的 分上 罢 ！ ”,"If you will not let her do this for my sake or my wife 's sake , at least will not you let her for the sake of the one who has just died ? '"
说 着 流下泪来 。,And at this point he burst into tears .
王夫人 心中 为的是 凤姐 未 经过 丧事 ， 怕 他 料理 不起 ， 被 人 见笑 ；,"Lady Wang is only concern had been lest Xi-feng , who had had no experience of large-scale funerals , might find the task too big for her and perhaps end up by making a fool of herself ."
今 见 贾珍 苦苦 的 说 ， 心中 已 活 了 几分 ， 却 又 眼看 着 凤姐 出神 。,But Cousin Zhen is moving plea caused her attitude to soften considerably and she eyed Xi-feng thoughtfully as though struggling to make up her mind .
那凤姐 素日 最 喜揽 事 ， 好 卖弄 能干 ， 今 见 贾珍 如此 央 他 ， 心中 早已 允 了 ； 又 见 王夫人 有 活动 之 意 ， 便 向 王夫人 道 ： “ 大哥 说 得 如此 恳切 ， 太太 就 依 了 罢 。 ”,"Xi-feng for her part had always loved managing things and enjoyed showing off her ability to do so . When Cousin Zhen first made his request , her mind had at once consented ; and now , observing that Lady Wang appeared to be already half persuaded , she hastened to complete the process . ' Cousin Zhen has spoken so eloquently . Ought not we perhaps to agree , Aunt ? '"
王夫人 悄悄的 问道 ： “ 你 可能 么 ？ ”,' Do you think you can do it ? ' Lady Wang asked her in a low aside .
凤姐 道 ： “ 有 什么 不能 的 ！,"' I do not see why not , ' said Xi-feng . ' Cousin Zhen has already seen to all the outside arrangements himself . It is only a question of looking after the domestic side for a bit ."
外面 的 大事 已经 大 哥哥 料理 清 了 ， 不过 是 里面 照管 照管 。,"And even if there is anything I do not know about , I can always ask you . '"
便是 我 有 不知 的 ， 问 太太 就是 了 。 ”,"This seemed reasonable enough to Lady Wang , so she said nothing ."
王夫人 见 说得有理 ， 便 不出 声 。,"Seeing that Xi-feng herself appeared to be willing , Cousin Zhen turned to her with a smile ."
贾珍见 凤姐 允 了 ， 又 陪笑 道 ： “ 也 管 不得 许多 了 ， 横竖 要求 大 妹妹 辛苦 辛苦 。,"' Actually there is not so very much to do , ' he said . ' You really must let us persuade you to take this on ."
我 这里 先 与 大 妹妹 行礼 ， 等 完 了 事 ， 我 再 到 那 府 里 去 谢 。 ”,"Let me make you a reverence now , to show my gratitude . Then , when this is all over , I shall come round to your place to thank you properly . '"
说 着 就 作揖 ， 凤姐 连忙 还礼 不迭 。,"So saying , he clasped his hands before him and made her a formal bow Xi-feng hurriedly curtseyed back ."
贾珍便 命人 取 了 宁国府 的 对牌 来 ， 命 宝玉 送与 凤姐 ， 说道 ： “ 妹妹 爱 怎么 就 怎么样 办 ， 要 什么 ， 只管 拿 这个 取 去 ， 也 不必 问 我 。,"Cousin Zhen now ordered someone to fetch the tallies for the entire Ning-guo household and instructed Bao-yu to hand them to Xi-feng . ' I want you to manage things whatever way you like , ' he told her . ' Anything you want you can get by using one of these . There is no need to ask me for it ."
只求 别 存心 替 我 省钱 ， 要好看 为 上 ；,I have only two requests to make of you . First that you should dismiss from your mind any idea of trying to save me any money .
二则 也 同 那 府 里 一样 待 人才 好 ， 不要 存心 怕人 抱怨 ：,The important thing is to put on a good show : the expense does not matter . And secondly that you should treat our people here exactly as you treat the members of your own household . Do not be afraid of upsetting them .
只 这 两件 外 ， 我 再 没 不 放心 的 了 。 ”,"Provided that you will observe those conditions , I leave everything in your hands with the utmost confidence . '"
凤姐 不敢 就 接牌 ， 只 看着 王夫人 ， 王夫人 道 ： “ 你 大哥 既 这么 说 ， 你 就 照看 照看 罢了 。,"Xi-feng watched Lady Wang , not daring to accept the tallies without her approval . ' You hear what your cousin says , ' said Lady Wang . ' You had better do as he asks ."
只是 别自 作 主意 ， 有 了 事 打发 人 问 你 哥哥 嫂子 一声 儿 要紧 。 ”,"Only do not take too much upon yourself . If there are any decisions to make , be sure to ask Cousin Zhen or his wife first . '"
宝玉 早 向贾珍 手里 接过 对 牌 来 ， 强递 与 凤姐 了 。,Bao-yu had already received the tallies from Cousin Zhen and now thrust them at Xi-feng .
,"For politeness ' sake she feigned a certain amount of reluctance , but was soon prevailed upon to accept them ."
贾珍 又 问 ： “ 妹妹 还是 住 在 这里 ， 还是 天天 来 呢 ？,"' Will you stay here with us , ' Cousin Zhen asked her , ' or will you be coming over every day from the other house ?"
若 是 天天 来 ， 越发 辛苦 了 。,If you intend to come over from the other house every day it will greatly add to your burdens .
我 这里 赶着 收拾 出 一个 院落 来 ， 妹妹 住 过 这 几日 ， 倒 安稳 。 ”,"We have an apartment here with its own courtyard which we can very quickly place at your disposal . If you would care to move in for the next week or two , I am sure we could make you comfortable . '"
凤姐笑 说 ： “ 不用 ， 那边 也 离 不得 我 ， 倒 是 天天 来 的 好 。 ”,"' Thank you , but it will not be necessary , ' said Xi-feng with a smile . ' I am needed at the other house too , so it will be best if I come here every day . '"
贾珍 说 ： “ 也罢 了 。 ” 然后 又 说 了 一回 闲话 ， 方才 出去 。,"Having accomplished his mission , Cousin Zhen stayed chatting a little longer and then left ."
一时 女眷 散 后 ， 王夫人 因 问 凤姐 ： “ 你 今儿 怎么样 ？ ”,"Presently , when the visiting ladies had dispersed , Lady Wang asked Xi-feng what her plans were for the rest of the day ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 太太 只管 请回去 ； 我 须得先 理 出 一个 头绪 来 才 回得去 呢 。 ”,"' Please go on without me , Aunt , ' said Xi-feng . ' Before I go back myself I must first try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail . '"
王夫人 听说 ， 便 先同 邢夫人 回去 ， 不在话下 。,"Lady Wang accordingly left without more delay in the company of Lady Xing , and 8 the two ladies returned to the Rong-guo mansion , where we must now leave them ."
这里 凤姐 来 至 三间 一所 抱厦 中 坐 了 ， 因想 ：,"Alone at last , Xi-feng wandered into a sort of penthouse building where she sat down and tried to formulate the task that lay ahead ."
,"Five major abuses , long habitual in the Ning-guo establishment , presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need of attention , viz :"
头 一件 是 人口 混杂 ， 遗失 东西 ；,"1 . Because it was so large and so motley an establishment , things were always getting lost ."
二件 ， 事无 专管 ， 临期 推委 ；,"2 . Because there was no rational division of labour , it always seemed to be someone else 's responsibility whenever a job needed to be done ."
三件 ， 需用 过 费 ， 滥 支 冒领 ；,"3 . Because the household 's expenditure was so lavish , money was always getting misappropriated or misspent ."
四件 ， 任 无 大小 ， 苦乐不均 ；,"4 . Because no distinctions were made between one job and another , the rewards and hardships were unfairly distributed ."
五件 ， 家人 豪纵 ， 有 脸者 不能 服 钤 束 ， 无 脸者 不能 上 进 。,"5 . Because the servants were so arrogant and undisciplined , those with ' face ' could brook no restraint and those without could win no advancement ."
— — 此 五件 实 是 宁府中 风俗 。,
不知 凤姐 如何 处治 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"If you want to know how Xi-feng dealt with these abuses , you will have to read the chapter which follows ."
第十四回,Chapter 14
林如海 灵 返 苏州 郡,Lin Ru-hai is conveyed to his last resting-place in Soochow
贾宝玉 路 遏 北静王,And Jia Bao-yu is presented to the Prince of Bei-jing at a roadside halt
话 说 宁国府 中 都 总管 赖升 闻知 里面 委请 了 凤姐 ， 因 传齐 同事 人 等 说道 ： “ 如今 请 了 西府里 琏 二 奶奶 管理 内事 ， 倘或 他 来 支取 东西 ， 或是 说话 ， 小心 伺候 才 好 。,"When Lai Sheng , the Chief Steward of the Ning-guo mansion , learned that Xi-feng had been invited to take on the management of the household , he called his cronies together and addressed them in the following terms : ' Well lads , it seems that they have called in Mrs Lian from the other house to run things here for a bit ; so if she should happen to come round asking for anything or have occasion to talk to you about anything , be sure to do what she says , will not you ?"
每日 大家 早来 晚 散 ， 宁可 辛苦 这 一个月 ， 过后 再 歇息 ， 别 把 老 脸面 扔 了 。,"During this coming month we shall all have to start work a bit earlier and knock off a bit later than usual . If you will put up with a little extra hardship just for this month , we can make up for it by taking things easy when it is over . Anyway , I am relying on you not to let me down ."
那 是 个 有名 的 烈货 ， 脸酸 心硬 ； 一时 恼 了 ， 不认 人 的 ！ ”,"She is well known for a sour-faced , hard-hearted bitch is this one , and once she is got her back up , she will give no quarter , no matter who you are . So be careful ! '"
众人 都 道 ： “ 说 的 是 。 ”,There was a chorus of agreement from the rest .
又 有 一个 笑 道 ： “ 论理 ， 我们 里头 也 得 他 来 整治 整治 ， 都 忒 不象 了 。 ”,"One of them did observe , half-jokingly , that ' by rights they could do with someone like her to straighten things up a bit , considering the state they had got into ' ."
正说 着 ， 只见 来 旺 媳妇 拿 了 对牌 来领 呈文 经文 榜纸 ， 票 上 开 着 数目 。,"But just at that moment Brightie 's wife arrived on a mission from Xi-feng . She was to take receipt of some ledger-paper , buckram , and booklabels , and had a tally in her hand and a slip of paper specifying the quantities required ."
众人 连忙 让 坐 倒 茶 ， 〈 一面 命人 按 数 取纸 来 抱 着 ， 同来 旺 媳妇 〉 一路 来 至 仪门 ， 方 交与 来 旺 媳妇 自己 抱进去 了 。,"The men pressed round her offering her a place to sit and a cup of tea to drink while one of them hurried of with the list to fetch the needed items . Not only that , but , having fetched them , he carried them for her all the way to the inner gate of the mansion , only handing them to her then so that she could take them in to Xi-feng by herself ."
凤姐 即 命 彩明 钉 造册 簿 ； 即时 传 了 赖升 媳妇 ， 要 家口 花名册 查看 ， 又 限 明日 一早 传 齐家 人 媳妇 进府 听差 。,Xi-feng at once ordered Sunshine to make them up into stout workbooks for use in the office . At the same time she sent for Lai Sheng 's wife and asked her for the register of the household staff . She also told her to get in touch with all the married females on the staff and arrange for them to assemble first thing next morning to be told their new duties .
大概 点 了 一点 数目 单册 ， 问 了 赖升 媳妇 几句话 ， 便 坐车 回家 。,"Then , after roughly checking through the numbers in the ' establishment ' sheet and questioning Lai Sheng 's wife on a few points , she got into her carriage and drove back home ."
至 次日 卯正二刻 ， 便 过来 了 。,At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion .
那 宁国府 中 老婆 媳妇 早已 到 齐 ， 只见 凤姐 和 赖升 媳妇 分派 众人 执事 ， 不敢 擅入 ， 在 窗外 打听 。,"By this time all the married women on the staff had been assembled . Not daring to go in , they hung about outside the window listening to Xi-feng discussing work-plans with Lai Sheng 's wife inside the office ."
听见 凤姐 和 赖升 媳妇 道 ： “ 既 托 了 我 ， 我 就 说不得 要讨 你们 嫌 了 。,"' Now that I am in charge here ' , they heard her telling the latter , ' I will not promise to make myself agreeable ."
我 可比 不得 你们 奶奶 好性儿 ， 诸事 由 得 你们 。,"I haven ' t got a sweet temper like your mistress , you know . You will not find me letting you do everything just as it suits you ."
再 别说 你们 ‘ 这 府 里 原是 这么样 ’ 的话 ， 如今 可要 依着 我行 ， 错 我 一点儿 ， 管 不得 谁 是 有 脸 的 ， 谁 是 没脸 的 ， 一例 清白 处治 。 ”,"So do not let me hear anyone saying "" We do not do it that way here "" ! From now on , whatever it is , you do it the way I tell you to , and anyone who departs by as much as a hair is breadth from what I say is for it good and proper , no matter how senior or how important she thinks she is ! '"
说 罢 ， 便 吩咐 彩明念 花名册 ， 按 名 一个 一个 叫 进来 看视 ， 一时 看 完 ， 又 吩咐 道 ：,"Having delivered herself of this formidable preliminary she ordered Sunshine to call the roll . One by one the women stepped into the office to be looked at . When she had looked at them all , Xi-feng proceeded to make her dispositions ."
“ 这 二十个 分 作 两班 ， 一班 十个 ， 每日 在内 单管 亲友 来往 倒 茶 ， 别的 事 不用 管 。,' This twenty here . I want you to divide yourselves into two shifts of ten . Your job every day will be to look after lady visitors and serve them tea . That is all you have to do . Nothing else .
这 二十个 也 分作 两班 ， 每日 单管 本家 亲戚 茶饭 ， 也 不管 别的 事 。,' This twenty here . I want you divided into two shifts like the others . Your job will be serving tea and meals to the family . Nothing else .
这 四十个 人 也 分作 两班 ， 单 在 灵前 上 香 、 添油 、 挂幔 、 守灵 、 供饭 、 供 茶 、 随 起 举哀 ， 也 不管 别的 事 。,"' These forty . Again , two shifts . Your job is to look after the shrine : lighting fresh Joss-sticks , keeping the lamps in oil , changing the drapes . You will also take turns by the spirit tablet , making offerings of rice and tea , kotowing when the visitors kotow , wailing when they wail . That is your job and nothing else besides ."
这 四个 人 专 在内 茶房 收管 杯碟 茶器 ， 要少 了 一件 ， 四 人 分赔 。,"' You four are to look after the cups and plates and so forth in the ladies ' tea-room . If anything is missing , you share the responsibility between you and a quarter of the cost will be stopped out of each of your wages ."
这 四个 人 单管 酒饭 器皿 ， 少 一件 也 是 分赔 。,"' You four here are to look after the dinner-ware : bowls , wine-cups and the like . Anything missing will be stopped out of your wages ."
这 八个 人 单管 收 祭礼 。,' This eight here . I want you to take charge of all funeral offerings sent in from outside .
这 八个 单管 各处 灯油 、 蜡烛 、 纸札 ； 我 一 总支 了来 ， 交给 你们 八个 人 ， 然后 按 我 的 数儿 往 各处 分派 。,"' This eight . I want you to look after oil , candles , and paper-offerings . I am going to put the whole lot in your charge ; then whenever any is needed somewhere , you must go to wherever it is and supply them with whatever amount I tell you to ."
这 二十个 每日 轮流 各处 上 夜 ， 照管 门户 ， 监察 火烛 ， 打扫 地方 。,' This twenty here . I want you doing night duty by rota . You are to see that all the gates are locked and keep a look-out for fires . You will also be responsible for keeping the outside properly swept .
这 下剩 的 按房 分开 ， 某人 守 某处 ， 某处 所有 桌椅 古玩 起 ， 至于 痰 盒 撞 子 等 物 ， 一 草 一 苗 ， 或 丢 或 坏 ， 就 问 这 看守 的 赔补 。,"' The rest of you are to be divided up between the different apartments . Each of you will be responsible for the things in your own apartment , from furniture and antique ware down to spittoons and dusters . If the tiniest sliver gets lost or broken , you will be held responsible and will be expected to make it good ."
赖升 家 的 每日 揽 总 查看 ， 或 有 偷懒 的 ， 赌钱 吃酒 打架 拌嘴 的 ， 立刻 拿 了 来回 我 。,"' Lai Sheng 's wife will make a general inspection every day , and if she catches anyone idling or gambling or drinking or fighting or being difficult , she will at once bring them to me for dealing with . And there will be no favouritism ."
你 要 狥 情 ， 叫 我 查出来 ， 三四 辈子 的 老脸 ， 就 顾 不成 了 。,"If I find you have done something wrong , I shall not care whether you have been in service here for three or four generations , it will make no difference to me ."
如今 都 有 了 定规 ， 以后 那 一行 乱 了 ， 只 和 那 一行 算账 。,"' Well , now you all know the rules . From now on whenever any trouble occurs I shall know exactly who to hold responsible ."
素日 跟 我 的 人 ， 随身 俱 有 钟表 ， 不论 大小事 ， 都 有 一定 的 时刻 ， — — 横竖 你们 上 房里 也 有 时辰 钟 ：,"' Those who are used to working with me at the other place always have a watch handy , and everything they do , no matter how small a thing it is , is done at a fixed time . You may not have watches , but at least there is a clock in your master 's drawing-room you can look at ."
卯正二刻 我 来 点卯 ； 巳 正 吃 早饭 ；,So here are the main times to remember . At half past six I shall come over to hear the roll-call . At ten o'clock I take my lunch .
凡 有 领牌 回事 ， 只 在 ｛ 午初前 ｝ ；,"I shall see people with reports to make or tallies to collect up to , but not after , half past eleven ."
戌初 烧 过 黄昏 纸 ， 我 亲 到 各处 查 一遍 ， 回来 上夜 的 交明 钥匙 。,"At seven in the evening , as soon as the paper-offerings have been burnt , I shall make a personal tour of inspection ; and when I get back from it , I shall issue those on night duty with their keys ."
第二日 还是 卯正二 刻过来 。,Then next day I shall be back here again at half past six .
说不得 咱们 大家 辛苦 这 几日 罢 ， 事 完 了 你们 大爷 自然 赏 你们 。 ”,"' I dare say we are all going to be a bit overworked during the days ahead , but I am sure your master will want to reward you all for your trouble when this is over . '"
说 毕 ， 又 吩咐 按 数发 茶叶 、 油烛 、 鸡毛掸子 子 、 笤帚 等物 ， 一面 又 搬取 家伙 ： 桌面 、 椅 搭 、 坐褥 、 毡席 、 痰 盒 、 脚踏 之类 ， 一面 交发 ， 一面 提笔 登记 ， — — 某人 管 某处 ， 某人 领 物件 ， 开 的 十分 清楚 。,"Xi-feng now proceeded to supervise the distribution of supplies of tea , oil , candles , feather-dusters , and brooms to some of her work-parties , and to issue others with tablecloths , chair-covers , cushions , mats , spittoons , footstools , and other furnishings , an entry of the amount supplied being made in the book as each consignment was handed over . A clear record now existed of what individuals were in charge of which parts of the household , what items they were responsible for , and what duties they were expected to perform ."
众人 领 了 去 ， 也 都 有 了 投奔 ， 不似 先时 只 拣 便宜 的 做 ， 剩下 苦差 没 个 招揽 。 各 房中 也 不能 趁乱 迷失 东西 。,Gone now were the days when everyone picked the easiest tasks to do first and the less popular ones never got carried out ; gone the convenient disorder in which objects had so easily strayed ( no one ever knew how ) from the rooms where they belonged .
便是 人 来客 住 ， 也 都 安静 了 ， 不 比 先前 紊乱 无 头绪 ： 一切 偷安 窃取 等 弊 ， 一概 都 蠲了 。,"Even with the greatly increased coming and going occasioned by the bereavement , it was quieter now than it had been before , when muddle and confusion still prevailed . And the old idling and pilfering appeared to have been eradicated completely ."
凤姐 自己 威重令行 ， 心中 十分 得意 。,"Secure in her authority , respected and obeyed by all , Xi-feng might be forgiven for contemplating her achievement with a certain amount of satisfaction ."
因见 尤氏 犯病 ， 贾珍 也 过于 悲哀 ， 不大 进 饮食 ， 自己 每日 从 那 府 中 熬 了 各样 细粥 ， 精美 小菜 ， 令人 送过来 。,Meanwhile You-shi was still unwell and Cousin Zhen too crushed by his somewhat disproportionate grief to think much about eating and drinking . Xi-feng accordingly had all sorts of invalid slops for You-shi and tempting little delicacies for Cousin Zhen prepared in the kitchens of the Rong-guo mansion and sent over each day to the prostrate couple .
贾珍 也 另外 吩咐 每日 送 上 等 菜 到 抱厦 内 ， 单 预备 凤姐 。,Cousin Zhen reciprocated by instructing his own cooks to prepare dishes of the very highest quality exclusively for Xi-feng and having them carried round to her in her little penthouse office .
凤姐 不畏 勤劳 ， 天天 按 时刻 过来 ， 点卯 理事 ， 独在 抱厦 内起 坐 ， 不 与 众 妯娌 合群 ； 便 有 女眷 来往 ， 也 不 迎送 。,"Xi-feng seemed quite tireless in the discharge of her extra duties . Every morning she would be over at the appointed hour to hear the roll-call and would sit there alone in her office , never once emerging to mix with the young Ning-guo women of her own generation . Even when lady visitors arrived she remained in the office and took no part in their reception ."
这日 乃 五七 正 五日 上 ， 那 应佛僧 正 开方 破狱 ， 传灯 照亡 ， 参 阎君 ， 拘 都 鬼 ， 延请 地藏王 ， 开金 桥 ， 引 幢 幡 ；,"The Thirty-fifth had now arrived - an important day in the penitential cycle of seven times seven days preceding the funeral - and the monks in the main hall had reached a particularly dramatic part of their ceremonies . Having opened up a way for the imprisoned souls , the chief celebrant had succeeded by means of spells and incantations in breaking open the gates of hell . He had shone his light ( a little hand-mirror ) for the souls in darkness . He had confronted Yama , the Judge of the Dead . He had seized the demon torturers who resisted his progress . He had invoked Ksitigarbha , the Saviour King , to aid him . He had raised up a golden bridge , and now , by means of a little flag which he held aloft in one hand , was conducting over it those souls from the very deepest pit of hell who still remained undelivered ."
那道士 们 正 伏章 申表 ， 朝 三清 ， 叩 玉帝 ；,Meanwhile the ninety-nine Taoists in the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion were on their knees offering up a written petition to the Three Pure Ones and calling on the Jade Emperor himself in his heavenly palace .
神僧 们 行香 ， 放焰口 ， 拜水 忏 ， 又 有 十二 众 青年 尼僧 ， 搭 绣衣 ， 靸 红鞋 ， 在 灵前 默诵 接引 诸 咒 ：,"Outside , on their high staging , with swinging of censers and scattering of little cakes for the hungry ghosts to feed on , Zen monks were performing the great Water Penitential . And in the shrine where the coffin stood , six young monks and six young nuns , magnificently attired in scarlet slippers and embroidered copes , sat before the spirit tablet quietly murmuring the dharani that would assist the soul of the dead woman on the most difficult part of its journey into the underworld ."
十分 热闹 。,Everywhere there was a hum of activity .
那凤姐 知道 今日 的 客 不少 ， 寅 正 便 起来 梳洗 ， 及 收拾 完备 ， 更衣 盥手 ， 喝 了 几口 奶子 ， 漱口 已 毕 ， 正是 卯正二刻 了 。 来 旺 媳妇 率领 众人 伺候 已 久 。,"Knowing that the day would be a busy one bringing a greater than usual number of visitors , Xi-feng had risen at four o'clock in the morning to begin her toilet . By the time she had completed it , paid her daily tribute to nature , washed her hands , drunk a few mouthfuls of milk , and rinsed out her mouth , it was already half past six and Brightie 's wife , at the head of the other female domestics , had been waiting for some considerable time in the courtyard outside ."
凤姐 出至 厅 前 ， 上 了 车 ， 前面 一对 明角灯 ， 上写 “ 荣国府 ” 三个 大字 。,At last she emerged and stepped into the waiting carriage . Two horn lanterns inscribed in large characters with the words RONG-GUO HOUSE were borne before her as she went .
来 至 宁府 大门 首 ， 门灯 朗 挂 ， 两边 一色 绰灯 ， 照如 白昼 ， 白汪汪 穿孝 家人 两行 侍立 。,The great gate of the Ning-guo mansion was hung with lanterns and there were rows of identical standard lanterns on each side of the gateway illuminating the entrance with the brightness of noonday and eerily emphasizing the whiteness of the mourningclothes worn by the menservants lined up to receive the carriage .
请 车 至 正门 上 ， 小厮 退去 ， 众 媳妇 上来 揭起 车帘 。,At their invitation it was drawn in through the centremost of the three gates . Then the men-servants retired and Xi-feng 's own women hurried forward and raised the curtain of the carriage for her to descend .
凤姐 下 了 车 ， 一 手扶 着 丰儿 ， 两个 媳妇 执着 手把 灯 照着 ， 撮 拥 凤姐 进来 。 宁府 诸 媳妇 迎 着 请安 。,"She did so , leaning on the shoulder of her maid Felicity , and the two women with the lanterns led her in , lighting the way for her as they went , while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the Ning-guo household advanced to meet her , curtseyed , and chorused their morning greetings ."
凤姐 款 步入 会 芳 园中 登仙阁 灵前 ， 一 见 棺材 ， 那 眼泪 恰似 断线 之 珠 ， 滚 将 下来 。,"Xi-feng walked slowly through the All-scents Garden until she came to the shrine in the Ascension Pavilion . As soon as she caught sight of the coffin the tears , like pearls from a broken necklace , rolled in great drops down her cheeks ."
院中 多少 小厮 垂手 侍立 ， 伺候 烧纸 。,A number of pages were standing stiffly in the courtyard outside awaiting the command to set fire to the paper offerings .
凤姐 吩咐 一声 ： “ 供 茶 烧纸 。 ”,Xi-feng gave orders for them to begin and for tea to be offered up inside the shrine .
只 听 一棒锣鸣 ， 诸乐 齐奏 ， 早 有人 请 过 一张 大 圈椅 来 ， 放在 灵前 ， 凤姐 坐下 放声大哭 ， 于是 里外 上下 男女 接声 嚎哭 。,"At once there was a clash of cymbals followed by the mournful strains of a funeral band . An armchair had already been called for and set down facing the spirit tablet . In this Xi-feng now sat , and raising her voice to a shrill pitch , wept with abandon , whereupon the entire household , high and low , male and female , indoors and out , responded by breaking into loud and prolonged lamentation ."
贾珍 、 尤氏 忙 令人 劝止 ， 凤姐才 止住 了哭 。,Presently a representative of Cousin Zhen and You-shi arrived and begged Xi-feng to desist .
来 旺 媳妇 倒 茶 漱口 毕 ， 方 起身 ， 别 了 族 中 诸人 ， 自人 抱厦 来 ， 按 名 查点 ， 各项 人数 ， 俱 已 到 齐 ， 只有 迎送 亲友 上 的 一人 未 到 ， 即令 传来 。 那 人 惶恐 ， 凤姐 冷笑 道 ： “ 原来 是 你 悮 了 ！,"Brightie 's wife poured out a cup of tea for her to rinse her mouth with , and when she had sufficiently recovered herself she rose to her feet once more , took leave of various members of the clan who were present , and went off to her office in the penthouse . An inspection of the roster showed that all the members of her work-parties were present except for one woman belonging to the group responsible for the reception of friends of the family . Someone was sent to fetch her , and presently the woman arrived , flustered and fearful . ' So it is you ! ' said Xi-feng with a chilling smile ."
你 比 他们 有 体面 ， 所以 不 听 我 的话 ！ ”,"' I suppose you thought that because you have a somewhat more lady-like job than the rest , you could afford to disobey my orders !"
那人 回道 ： “ 奴才 天天 都 来 的 早 ， 只有 今儿 来迟 了 一步 ， 求 奶奶 饶 过 初次 。 ”,"' Oh no , madam , indeed not ! said the woman . I have been coming extra early every day . It is only today , because I overslept , that I am a bit late . Please let me off this once , madam ! It really is the first time . '"
正说 着 ， 只见 荣国府 中 的 王兴媳妇 来 了 ， 往 里 探头 儿 。,"Just at that moment Xi-feng observed Wang Xing 's wife from the Rong-guo mansion , peeping round the door as if looking for a chance to speak to her ."
凤姐 且 不 发放 这 人 ， 却 问 ： “ 王兴媳妇 来 作 什么 ？ ”,"' Yes , what is it ? ' she asked , turning away from the offender but giving her no indication that she might go ."
王兴家 的 近前 说 ： “ 领牌 取 线 ， 打车 轿 网络 。 ”,Wang Xing 's wife approached and said that she wanted a tally authorizing the purchase of silk cord to be made up into carriage trimmings for the funeral .
说 着 将 帖 儿 递 上 ， 凤姐令 彩明 念道 ： “ 大 轿 两顶 ， 小 轿 四顶 ， 车 四辆 ， 共用 大小 络子 若干根 ， 每 根用 珠儿 线 若干 斤 。 ” 凤姐 听 了 数目 相合 ， 便命 彩明 登记 ， 取 荣国府 对牌 发下 。 王兴家 的 去 了 。,"She handed Xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written . It specified the number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans , four small sedans , and four carriages , and the number of pounds of silk cord that would be required for that amount of network . Xi-feng made Sunshine read it out to her , and having satisfied herself that the figures were correct , told him to enter them in his book and to issue Wang Xing 's wife with one of the Rong-guo tallies , whereupon the latter hurried off to complete her mission ."
凤姐方 欲 说话 ， 只见 荣国府 的 四个 执事 人 进来 ， 都 是 支取 东西 领牌 的 ， 凤姐命 他们 要 了 帖 念 过 ， 听 了 一共 四件 ， 因 指 两件 道 ： “ 这个 开销 错 了 ， 再 算清 了来 领 。 ” 说 着 将 帖子 摔下来 。,"Xi-feng was about to address the latecomer when four more servants from the Rong-guo mansion came in asking for tallies . She told them to hand over the order-slips and made Sunshine read them out to her . Two of them contained errors , and Xi-feng flung them down and told the bearers to ' go away and come back when they had got their figures right ' ."
那 二人 扫兴 而 去 。,The two of them went off crestfallen .
凤姐 因 见 张 材家 的 在 旁 ， 便 问 ： “ 你 有 什么 事 ？ ”,Xi-feng next observed Zhang Cai 's wife hovering about at the edge of the room and asked her what she wanted .
张 材家 的 忙取 帖子 回 道 ： “ 就是 方才 车 轿 围子 做成 ， 领取 裁缝 工银 若干 两 。 ”,"' It is those carriage curtains , madam . We want the money for the tailor who made them up . '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 收 了 帖子 ， 命彩 明 登记 ， 待 王兴 交过 ， 得 了 买办 的 回押 相符 ， 然后 与 张 材家 的 去 领 。,Xi-feng took the bill and told Sunshine to enter the figures from it in his book . But she would not authorize Zhang Cai 's wife to pay for the tailoring until Wang Xing 's wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer 's receipt .
一面 又 命念 那 一件 ， 是 为 宝玉 外 书房 完竣 ， 支领 买 纸料 糊裱 ， 凤姐 听 了 ， 即 命 收 帖 儿 登记 ， 待 张 材家 的 缴清 再 发 。,"There was a second piece of paper which Sunshine now read , requesting permission to purchase paper for the windows of Bao-yu 's outer study , which had just been redecorated . This too Xi-feng kept , and made Sunshine enter the amount in his book . She told Zhang Cai 's wife that the goods must be supplied first before any payment could be authorized ."
凤姐 便 说道 ： “ 明儿 他 也 来 迟 了 ， 后儿 我 也 来 迟 了 ， 将来 都 没有 人 了 。,"' Tomorrow another one will be late and the day after that it will be someone else , said Xi-feng turning to the still waiting offender , ' and before we know where we are we shall have no one turning up at all ."
本来 要 饶 你 ， 只是 我 头 一次 宽 了 ， 下次 就 难 管 别人 了 ， 不如 开发 了 好 。 ”,"I should have liked to let you off , but if I am lenient with you the first time , it will be that much harder for me to deal with someone else the second time ; so I am obliged to make an example of you . ' Her face hardened as she pronounced sentence : ' Take her out and give her twenty strokes of the bamboo ! '"
登时 放下 脸 来 ， 叫 “ 带 出去 打 他 二十 板子 ！ ”,"Seeing that Xi-feng was really angry , the servants dared not show themselves slack in executing her command ."
众人 见 凤姐 动怒 ， 不敢 怠慢 ， 拉出去 照数 打 了 ， 进来 回覆 ；,"The wretched woman was half-dragged from the room and the flogging administered in full view of the waiting throng , after which they came in again , the executioners to report that they had discharged their duty and their victim to thank Xi-feng for her punishment ."
凤姐 又 掷 下 宁府 对 牌 ： “ 说 与 赖升 ， 革 他 一个月 的 钱粮 。,Xi-feng threw down one of the Ning-guo tallies . ' Take this to Lai Sheng and tell him to stop a month 's pay from her wages .
〈 明日 再 有误 的 ， 打 四十 ， 后日 的 六十 ， 要 挨打 的 ， 只管 误 ！ 〉,If anyone is late tomorrow they will get forty strokes and the day after that it will be sixty . So if you enjoy being beaten you have only to come late for rollcall .
散 了 罢 。 ”,Dismiss . '
众人 方 各自 办事 去 了 。 那 被 打 的 也 含羞 饮泣 而 去 。,"The servants , including the shamefaced and silently weeping victim , trooped off to their various duties ."
彼时 荣宁 两处 领牌 交牌 人 往来 不 绝 ， 凤姐 又 一一 开发 了 。,"Now began a steady stream of servants from both households collecting and returning tallies , each of whom Xi-feng attended to in a brisk and efficient manner ."
于是 宁府中 人才 知 凤姐 利害 ， 自此 俱 各 兢兢业业 ， 不敢 偷安 ， 不在话下 。,"From that day onwards the staff of the Ning-guo mansion realized just how formidable Xi-feng could be and went about their duties in fear and trembling , not daring to idle or delay ."
如今 且说 宝玉 ， 因见 人众 ， 恐 秦钟 受 委曲 ， 遂 同 他 往 凤姐 处 坐坐 ， 凤姐正 吃饭 ， 见 他们 来 了 ， 笑 道 ： “ 好 长 腿子 ， 快上来 罢 。 ”,"But let us now turn to Bao-yu . On this particular occasion , fearing that with so great an influx of visitors Qin Zhong might find himself somewhat overwhelmed , Bao-yu brought him round to Xi-feng 's office for a quiet chat . ' Did you smell the food ? ' said Xi-feng with a laugh . ( She was halfway through her lunch when they entered . ) ' Come up on the kang and have some ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我们 偏 了 。 ”,"' Thank you , but we have already eaten , ' said Bao-yu ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 在 这边 外头 吃 的 ， 还是 那边 吃 的 ？ ”,"' Here , or in the other house ? '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 同 那些 浑人 吃 什么 ！,' Catch me eating here with those clowns ! ' said Bao-yu .
还是 那边 跟着 老太太 吃 了 来 的 。 ”,"' No , back at home , with Grandmother . ' He and Qin Zhong sat down , and presently Xi-feng finished her lunch . Just then a woman came in asking for a tally with which to obtain a fresh supply of oil for the altar lamps ."
说 着 ， 一面 归 坐 。 凤姐 饭 毕 ， 就 有 宁府 一个 媳妇 来 领牌 ， 为 支取 香灯 ， 凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 我 算 着 你 今儿 该 来 支取 ， 想 是 忘 了 。,"' I calculated that you would be needing some by now , ' said Xi-feng with a smile . ' I thought you must have forgotten ."
要 终久 忘 了 ， 自然 是 你 包 出来 ， 都 便宜 了 我 。 ”,"If you had forgotten , you would have had to pay for it yourself . That would have suited me down to the ground !"
那 媳妇 笑 道 ： “ 何尝 不是 忘 了 ， 方才 想 起来 ， 再迟 一步 ， 也 领 不成 了 ！ ”,"' Oh no , madam ! As you say , I just forgot . I only thought of it a moment ago , and I realized that if I did not hurry I should be too late to get a tally . '"
说 毕 ， 领牌 而 去 。,"So saying , she took her tally and went ."
一时 登记 交牌 。,For a short while longer the handing over of tallies and registering of amounts continued .
秦钟因 笑 道 ： “ 你们 两府 里 都 是 这 牌 ， 倘 别人 私造 一个 ， 支了 银子 去 ， 怎么 好 ？ ”,"' Both your houses use these tallies for everything , ' said Qin Zhong , who had been watching these transactions with some interest . ' Suppose some outsider were to forge one and use it to get a lot of money with ? '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 依 你 说 ， 都 没 王法 了 ！ ”,' Not everyone is as crooked as you are ! ' said Xi-feng goodhumouredly .
宝玉 因道 ： “ 怎么 咱们 家 没人来 领 牌子 支 东西 ？ ”,' How is it that there is no one from our place coming in for tallies ? ' Bao-yu asked .
凤姐 道 ： “ 他们 来领 的 时候 ， 你 还 做梦 呢 。,"' At the time when they come , ' Xi-feng replied , ' you are still fast asleep in bed ."
— — 我 且 问 你 ， 你们 多早晚 才 念 夜 书 呢 ？ ”,Now let me ask you something . When are you going to begin studying at night ? '
宝玉 道 ： “ 巴不得 今日 就 念 才 好 ； 只是 他们 不快 给 收拾 书房 ， 也 是 没法儿 。 ”,"' I should like nothing better than to begin today , ' said Bao-yu . ' But what can I do if they will not get on with my study ? '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 请 我 请 儿 ， 包管 就 快 了 。 ”,"' If you were to ask me nicely , ' said Xi-feng jovially , ' I think I could undertake to hurry them up for you . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 也 不中用 ， 他们 该 做到 那里 的 时候 ， 自然 有 了 。 ”,"' Oh , you are no good , ' said Bao-yu , ' no more than any of the rest . They will get round to it in time . It is just a question of waiting till they do . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 就是 他们 做 也 得 要 东西 ， 搁不住 我 不 给 对牌 ， 是 难 的 。 ”,"' Whether they get round to it or not , ' said Xi-feng , ' they still need materials for the job , and they can not get the materials if I do not choose to give them the tallies - I can tell you that for sure ! '"
宝玉 听说 ， 便 猴 向凤姐 身上 立刻 要牌 ， 说 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 给 他们 牌 ， 好 支 东西 去 收拾 。 ”,"As soon as he heard this , Bao-yu twined himself round Xi-feng and began coaxing and wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work on his study ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 我 乏 的 身上 生疼 ， 还搁 的 住 你 这么 揉搓 ？,' Stop it ! Stop it ! ' cried Xi-feng . ' I am so tired that my bones ache . How can I stand up to being mauled about by a great ape like you ?
你 放心 罢 ， 今儿 才 领 了 裱糊 纸 去 了 ， 他们 该 要 的 还 等 叫 去 呢 ， 可不 傻 了 ？ ”,You need not worry . They have just been round to see about paper for the windows . It would look pretty stupid if you were to send them off for something they have already got . '
宝玉 不 信 ， 凤姐 便 叫 彩 明查 册子 给 他 看 。,Bao-yu refused to believe her until she made Sunshine look up the entry in his book and show it to him .
正 闹 着 ， 人 来回 ： “ 苏州 去 的 昭 儿 来 了 。 ”,"While Bao-yu was inspecting the book , a servant announced the arrival of Shiner , one of the boys who had accompanied Jia Lian to Yangchow ."
凤姐 急 命 叫 进来 。,Xi-feng eagerly ordered him in .
昭 儿 打千 儿 请安 。,Shiner louted to his mistress in the Manchu fashion and hoped that she was well .
凤姐 便 问 ： “ 回来 做 什么 ？ ”,' Why have you come back ? ' said Xi-feng .
昭 儿 道 ： “ 二爷 打发 回来 的 。,"' The Master sent me , madam ."
林 姑老爷 是 ［ 九月 ］ 初三 巳时 没 的 。 二爷 帮 了 林姑娘 同送林 姑老爷 的 灵 到 苏州 ， 大约 赶 ｛ 春末 ｝ 回来 。,Mr. Lin died on the third at ten in the morning and the Master and Miss Lin are taking him to Soochow to be buried . They expect to be home by the end of the spring .
二爷 打发 奴才 来 报 个 信儿 请安 ， 讨 老太太 的 示下 。,"The Master told me to bring back the news and to give everyone his regards , and he said I was to ask Her Old Ladyship for instructions ."
还 瞧瞧 奶奶 家里 好 ， 叫 把 大毛 衣裳 带 几件 去 。 ”,"He also told me to see if you were getting on all right , madam ; and he said would I take some fur-lined gowns back with me for winter wear . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 你 见 过 别人 了 没有 ？ ”,' Have you seen anyone else yet ? ' Xi-feng asked him .
昭 儿 道 ： “ 都 见 过 了 。 ”,"' Yes , everyone , ' said Shiner , and withdrew ."
说 毕 ， 连忙 退出 。,Xi-feng turned to Bao-yu with a smile :
凤姐 向宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 林妹妹 可 在 咱们 家住 长 了 。 ”,' It looks now as if your Cousin Lin will be staying with us permanently . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 了不得 ， 想来 这 几日 他 不知 哭 的 怎么样 呢 ！ ”,' Poor thing ! ' said Bao-yu . ' How she must have cried and cried during this past week or so ! '
说 着 蹙眉 长叹 。,The thought of her crying made him knit his brows and sigh .
凤姐 见 昭 儿 回来 ， 因 当着 人 不及 细问 贾琏 ， 心中 七上八下 ， 待 要 回去 ， 奈 事 未 毕 ， 少不得 耐 到 晚上 回来 ， 又 叫 进 昭 儿 来 ， 细问 一路平安 。,"Now that Shiner was back , Xi-feng was all agog to question him about Jia Lian but could not do so in any detail in front of the others . She would have liked to follow him back home , but her duties were by no means over , and she was obliged to hold out until evening . Then , back in her own apartment , she summoned him to her and asked him for full particulars of the journey ."
连夜 打点 大毛 衣服 ， 和 平儿 亲自 检点 收拾 ， 再 细细 追想 所 需 何物 ， 一并 包裹 交给 昭 儿 。,"She looked out all Jia Lian 's furs , and she and Patience sat up into the night getting them ready and packing them - together with anything else which careful thought suggested might be needed - for Shiner to take back with him to his Master ."
又 细细 儿 的 吩咐 昭 儿 ： “ 在外 好生 小心 些 伏侍 ， 别 惹 你 二爷 生气 。,"Xi-feng gave Shiner minute instructions concerning his conduct towards the latter : ' Mind you look after your master properly away from home , now . Try not to make him angry ."
时常 劝 他少 喝酒 ， 别 勾引 他 认得 混账 女人 ， — — 我 知道 了 ， 回来 打折 了 你 的 腿 ！ ”,"And do always be on at him not to drink too much . And do not encourage him to get mixed up with bad women . If when you get back , I find out that you have done , I will break your legs !"
昭 儿 笑 着 答应 出去 。,Shiner laughingly agreed to abide by all her instructions .
那时 天 已 四 更 ， 睡 下 ， 不觉 早 又 天明 ， 忙 梳洗 过宁府 来 。,By the time they got to bed it was well past one in the morning . To Xi-feng it seemed as though she had barely lain down to sleep when it was dawn once more and time to get up again and wash and dress for another round of duties at Ning-guo House .
那 贾珍 因见 发引 日近 ， 亲自 坐车 带 了 阴阳生 ， 往 铁槛 寺 来 踏看 寄灵 之所 ；,The day of the funeral was now approaching and Cousin Zhen took an expert in geomancy with him in his carriage and drove out to the Temple of the Iron Threshold to inspect the terrain and personally assist in the selection of a suitable resting-place for Qin-shi is coffin .
又 一一 嘱咐 住持 色空 好生 预备 新鲜 陈设 ， 多 请 名 僧 ， 以备 接灵 使用 。,"He gave detailed instructions to the monk-in-charge , Father Sublimitas , for the provision of a completely new set of hangings and altar furnishings for the funeral , and for the engagement of as many fashionable monks as he could think of to participate in the ceremony of receiving the coffin ."
色 空忙 备 晚 斋 ， 贾珍 也 无心 茶饭 ， 因 天晚 不及 进城 ， 就 在 净室 胡乱 歇 了 一夜 ， 次日 一早 赶忙 的 进城 来 料理 出殡 之 事 ；,"Sublimitas hurriedly prepared a vegetarian supper for his visitors ; but Cousin Zhen had little heart for eating , and , as it was by now too late to return to the city , presently retired to a bed that had been made up for him in the monk 's quarters , leaving first thing next morning in order to press on with arrangements for the funeral ."
一面 又 派 人 先 往 铁槛 寺 ， 连夜 另外 修饰 停灵 之 处 ， 并 厨茶 等 项 ， 接灵 人口 。,On his return he sent some workmen out to the temple to refurbish the place he had chosen for the coffin . They were instructed to work on the job throughout the night in order to make sure that it was finished in time . He also sent out a number of kitchen staff to cater for the funeral party on its arrival .
凤姐 见 发引 日期 在 迩 ， 也 预先 逐 细分 派 料理 ， 一面 又 派 荣府 中车 轿人 从 跟 王夫人 送殡 ， 又 顾 自己 送殡 去 占 下处 。,"Xi-feng , too , began to make her own careful preparations as the day of the funeral drew near . On the one hand she had to select coachmen and bearers from the Rong-guo staff for the carriages and sedans that Lady Wang and the other Rong-guo ladies would ride in in the procession ."
目今 正值 缮 国公 诰命 亡故 ， 邢王二 夫人 又 去 吊祭 送殡 ， 西安 郡妃 华诞 ， 送 寿礼 ；,"On the other hand , as she fully intended to take part in it herself , she had to find herself somewhere to stop at on the way as well as accommodation for the night after the funeral . The Dowager-duchess of Shan-guo happened to die just about this time and Xi-feng had to make the arrangements for Lady Xing and Lady Wang when they paid their visits of condolence and later when they attended the funeral . She had to see about birthday presents for the Princess of Xi-an ."
又 有 胞兄 王仁 连 家眷 回南 ， 一面 写 家信 并 带往 之 物 ；,She had to write to her parents and get things ready to send to them when her elder brother Wang Ren returned with his wife and children to the South .
又 兼 迎春 染疾 ， 每日 请 医 服药 ， 看 医生 的 启帖 ， 讲论 症源 ， 斟酌 药案 … …,"And when on top of all this Jia Lian 's young sister Ying-chun fell ill and needed doctors ' visits and medicines every day it was Xi-feng who had to puzzle over the diagnostic reports , discuss the patient 's symptoms with the learned physicians , and decide on the relative merits of rival prescriptions ."
各事 冗杂 ， 亦 难 尽述 ：,"Indeed , so multifarious had her activities become that it would be impossible to list them all ."
因此 忙 的 凤姐 茶饭无心 ， 坐卧不宁 。,As a consequence she was far too busy to pay much attention to eating and drinking and could hardly sit or lie down for a moment in peace .
到 了 宁府 里 ， 这边 荣府 的 人 跟着 ； 回到 荣府 里 ， 那边 宁府 的 人 又 跟着 。,"When she went to the Ning-guo mansion she was followed around all the time by people from the Rong-guo mansion , and when she went back to Rong-guo House , members of the Ning-guo establishment would trail after her ."
凤姐 虽然 如此 之 忙 ， 只 因素 性 好胜 ， 惟恐 落人 褒贬 ， 故 费尽 精神 ， 筹划 的 十分 整齐 ， 于是 合族 中 上下 无不 称叹 。,"Yet although she was so busy , a passion to succeed and a dread of being criticized enabled her to summon up reserves of energy , and she managed to plan everything with such exemplary thoroughness that every member of the clan was loud in her praises ."
这日 伴宿 之夕 ， 亲朋 满座 ， 尤氏 犹 卧于 内室 ， 一切 张罗 款待 ， 都 是 凤姐 一 人 周全 承应 ， 合族 中 虽有 许多 妯娌 ， 也 有 言语 钝 拙 的 ， 也 有 举止轻浮 的 ， 也 有羞口羞脚不惯见人 的 ， 也 有 惧 贵 怯 官 的 ， 越 显得 凤姐 洒爽 风流 ， 典则俊雅 ， 真是 “ 万绿丛中 一点红 ” 了 ，,"Wake night arrived - the night when no one in the family may go to bed - and Ning-guo House was crowded with friends and relations . Since You-shi was still confined to her room , it was left entirely to Xi-feng to do the honours . There were , to be sure , a number of other young married women in the clan , but all were either tonguetied or giddy , or they were so petrified by bashfulness or timidity that the presence of strangers or persons of higher rank threw them into a state of panic . Xi-feng is vivacious charm and social assurance stood out in striking contrast - ' a touch of scarlet in a field of green ' ."
— — 那里 还 把 众人 放在眼里 ？ 挥霍 指示 ， 任 其 所为 。,"She was in her element , and if she took any notice at all of her humbler sisters it was only to throw out an occasional order or to bend them in some other way to her imperious will ."
那 一夜 中灯 明火 彩 ， 客送官 迎 ， 百般 热闹 ， 自 不用说 。,Throughout the whole of that night the Ning-guo mansion was ablaze with lights . There was a constant bustle of guests being welcomed or seen off the premises and all the liveliness and excitement that is customary on occasions of this sort .
至 天明 吉时 ， 一般 六十四名 青衣 请 灵 ， 前面 铭旌 上大书 ： “ 诰封 一等 宁国 公冢孙 妇 防护 内廷紫 禁道 御 前 侍卫 龙禁尉 享强 寿贾门 秦氏 宜人 之 灵柩 ” 。,"With the dawning of the day and the arrival of the hour deemed auspicious for its departure , sixty-four green-coated bearers arrived for the coffin , preceded by a great funeral banner bearing the following inscription : Mortal Remains of the Much Lamented LADY QIN-SHI of the House of Jia , Senior Great-great-granddaughter-in-law of the Duke of Ning-guo , Nobleman of the First Rank by Imperial Patent , and Wife of the Right Honourable Jia Rong , Honorary Captain in the Imperial Bodyguard , Inner Palace , Northern Capital Division ."
一应 执事 陈设 ， 皆 系现 赶新 做 出来 的 ， 一色 光彩夺目 。,"The costumes , insignia , and funeral trappings were all glitteringly new , having been specially made for the occasion ."
宝珠 自行 未嫁 女 之 礼 ， 摔 丧驾灵 ， 十分 哀苦 。,"Jewel , acting in the capacity of unmarried daughter of the deceased , smashed a bowl on the floor at the foot of the coffin and as they bore it out walked in front with an impressive display of grief ."
那时 官客 送殡 的 ， 有 镇国 公牛 清 之 孙现袭 一等 伯 牛继宗 ， 理 国公 柳彪 之 孙现袭 一等 子柳芳 ， 齐国 公陈翼 之 孙 世袭 三品 威镇 将军 陈 瑞文 ， 治国 公马 魁之孙 世袭 三品 威远 将 军马 尚德 ， 修国 公侯 晓明之 孙 世袭 一等 子侯孝康 ， — — 缮 国公 诰命 亡故 ， 其 孙石光 珠 守孝 不得 来 ： — — 这 六家 与 荣宁 二家 ， 当日 所 称 “ 八公 ” 的 便是 。,"Among the distinguished guests taking part in the procession were : Niu Ji-zong ( earl , hereditary first rank ) , grandson of Niu Qing , Duke of Zhen-guo , Liu Fang ( viscount , hereditary first rank ) , grandson of Liu Biao , Duke of Li-guo , Chen Rui-wen ( Maj . - General ) , grandson of Chen Yi , Duke of Qi-guo , Ma Shang-de ( Maj . - General ) , grandson of Ma Kui , Duke of Zhi-guo , Hou Xiao-kang ( viscount , hereditary first rank ) , grandson of Hou Xiao-ming , Duke of Xiu-guo . The grandfathers of the above , together with the Duke of Shan-guo , whose grandson Shi Guang-zhu was in mourning for the Dowager-duchess and unable to attend , and the Dukes of Rong-guo and Ning-guo , had formed the well-known group often referred to by their contemporaries as the ' Eight Dukes ' ."
余者 更 有 南 安郡王 之 孙 ， 西宁 郡 王之孙 ， 忠 靖侯史 鼎 ， 平原 侯之孙 世袭 二等 男 蒋子宁 ， 定城 侯之孙 世袭 二等 男 兼 京 营 游击 谢 鲲 ， 襄阳 侯之孙 世袭 二等 男 戚建辉 ， 景田 侯之孙 五城 兵马 司裘良 。,"The other mourners included : The grandson of H. H. the Prince of Nan-an , The grandson of H. H. the Prince of Xi-ning , Shi Ding , Marquis of Zhong-jing , nephew of old Lady Jia , Jiang Zi-ning ( baron , hereditary second rank ) , grandson of the Marquis of Ping-yuan , Xie Kun ( baron , hereditary second rank , and lieutenant-colonel , Metropolitan Barracks ) , grandson of the Marquis of Ding-cheng , Qi Jian-hui ( baron , hereditary second rank ) , grandson of the Marquis of Xiang-yang , Qiu Liang ( Chief Commissioner of Police , Metropolitan Area ) , grandson of the Marquis of Jing-tian ."
余者 锦乡伯 公子 韩奇 、 神武 将军 公子 冯紫英 、 陈也俊 、 卫若兰 等 ， 诸 王孙公子 ， 不可 枚 数 。,"Also present were the Marquis of Jin-xiang 's son Han Qi , General Feng 's son Feng Zi-ying , General Chen 's son Chen Ye-jun , General Wei is son Wei Ruo-lan , and a large number of other young gentlemen of distinguished parentage ."
堂客 也 共有 十来 顶 大 轿 ， 三四十 顶 小 轿 ， 连家 下 大小 轿子 车辆 ， 不下 百十余 乘 。,"As for lady guests , there were ten or so large and thirty or forty small palanquins , which together with the palanquins and carriages of the Jia ladies brought the total number of equipages to at least a hundred and ten ."
连 前面 各色 执事 陈设 ， 接连 一带 摆 了 有 三四里 远 。,"These , with the innumerable bearers of insignia and other funeral trappings up at the front , formed a procession altogether more than a mile long ."
走 不多时 ， 路上 彩棚 高 搭 ， 设席 张 筵 ， 和 音 奏乐 ， 俱 是 各家 路祭 ：,The procession had not advanced very far when it began to pass the decorated ' funeral bowers ' and tables of offerings put up along the sides of the street by friends and well-wishers of the family . From some of them the strains of funeral music struck up as it approached .
第一 棚 是 东平 郡王府 的 祭 ， 第二 棚 是 南 安郡王 的 祭 ， 第三 棚 是 西宁 郡王 的 祭 ， 第四 棚 便是 北静郡王 的 祭 。,"The first of these bowers was the Princess of Dong-ping 's , the second was the Prince of Nan-an 's , the third was the Prince of Xi-ning 's , and the fourth that of the Prince of Bei-jing ."
原来 这 四王 ， 当日 惟 北静王 功 最高 ， 及 今 子孙 犹袭 王爵 。,"Of the original holders of these four titles the Prince of Bei-jing had been highest in imperial favour by virtue of his great services to the Crown . As a consequence , the title and the style of ' prince ' had been retained by his descendants ."
现今 北静王 〈 水溶 〉 年 未 弱冠 ， 生得美 秀 异常 ， 性情 谦和 ；,"The present holder of the title , Shui Rong , was a youth still in his teens - a young man of great personal beauty and a modest and unaffected disposition ."
近闻 宁国府 冢 孙 妇告 殂 ， 因想 当日 彼此 祖父 有 相与 之 情 ， 同 难同 荣 ， 因此 不 以 王位 自居 ， 前日 也 曾 探丧 吊祭 ， 如今 又 设 了 路 奠 ， 命 麾下 的 各 官 在 此 伺候 。,"On receiving the announcement of the premature demise of the wife of one of the Duke of Ning-guo 's descendants , Shui Rong was reminded of the friendship that had formerly existed between the Duke of Ning-guo and his own ancestor - both having fought in the same campaigns and shared hardships and triumphs together - and resolved to lay aside all considerations of rank in demonstrating his sympathy for the bereaved . Two days previously he had paid a visit of condolence and made inquiries about the funeral arrangements , and now , today , intending to make a libation to the coffin as it went by , he had had his booth constructed at the road side and had instructed a number of his staff to wait there in readiness for his arrival ."
自己 五更 入 朝 ， 公事 一 毕 ， 便 换 了 素服 ， 坐 着 大 轿 ， 鸣锣 张伞 而 来 ， 到 了 棚 前 落 轿 ， 手下 各 官 两旁 拥侍 ， 军民 人 众 不得 往 还 。,"At four o'clock that morning the prince had had to be present at the imperial palace for the early levée ; but , as soon as his business there was over , he changed out of court dress and into mourning and after getting into his great palanquin , was borne through the streets , preceded by gongs and umbrellas of state , to the place where his funeral bower had been erected . There his palanquin was set down and the gentlemen of his household ranged themselves on either side of it . The street was kept clear of traffic and pedestrians while he waited ."
一时 只见 宁府 大 殡 浩浩荡荡 、 压地 银山 一般 从 北 而至 。,"Presently the procession came in sight , advancing from the north end of the street like a great river , the hearse itself looking like some great silver mountain that crushed the earth beneath it as it moved ."
早 有 宁府 开路 传事 人报 与 贾珍 ， 贾珍 急 命 前面 执事 扎 住 ， 同 贾 赦贾 政三人 连忙 迎上来 ， 以 国礼 相见 。,"In a trice the forerunners had reported back to Cousin Zhen , who at once gave orders to the insignia bearers to halt , and hurrying forward with his Uncles Jia She and Jia Zheng , saluted the prince with full court etiquette ."
北静王 轿 内 欠身 ， 含笑 答礼 ， 仍 以 世交 称呼 接待 ， 并 不 自大 。,"The prince received their prostrations with a gracious smile and a slight inclination of his person inside the palanquin , and when he spoke to them it was not as a prince to a subject , but using the form of address he employed when speaking to family friends ."
贾珍 道 ： “ 犬妇 之 丧 ， 累 蒙郡驾 下临 ， 荫 生辈 何以 克 当 。 ”,"' Your Highness , I am quite overwhelmed by the honour you do us in graciously condescending to be present at the funeral of my daughter-in-law , ' said Cousin Zhen ."
北静王 笑 道 ： “ 世交 至谊 ， 何 出 此言 。 ”,"' My dear friend , ' said the Prince of Bei-jing , ' your excessive modesty does us both an injustice . '"
遂 回头 令 长府 官 主祭 代奠 。,Thereupon he turned to the chamberlain of his household and ordered him to make offerings on his behalf .
贾 赦等 一旁 还礼 ， 复 亲身 来谢 。,"Cousin Zhen and his uncles made the correct ritual responses while this official performed them , then returned to the palanquin and bowed their thanks to the prince ."
北静王 十分 谦逊 。 因 问 贾政道 ： “ 那 一位 是 衔 玉 而 诞者 ？,The prince received their thanks with a most becoming modesty and by way of conversation asked Jia Zheng a question about Bao-yu : ' Which is the boy who was born with a stone in his mouth ?
久欲一见 为 快 ， 今日 一定 在 此 ， 何不 请来 ？ ”,I have long looked forward to the pleasure of meeting him . I am sure he must be here today . Can you not bring him to see me ? '
贾政忙 退下来 ， 命 宝玉 更衣 ， 领 他 前来 谒见 。,"Jia Zheng at once withdrew to fetch Bao-yu . He made him first change into court dress before , leading him forward to meet the prince ."
那宝玉 素闻 北静王 的 贤德 ， 且 才貌俱全 ， 风流跌宕 ， 不 为官 俗 国体 所 缚 ， 每 思 相会 ， 只是 父亲 拘束 ， 不 克 如愿 ， 今 见 反来 叫 他 ， 自 是 喜欢 。,"Bao-yu had often heard about the Prince of Bei-jing . He had heard that he was very clever . He had also heard that he was as handsome as he was clever and that he was a quite jolly , unconventional sort of person who refused to let either his royal birth or the conventions of official life constrain him . He had often wanted to meet him , but had been deterred by his father 's strictness from doing so . And now here was the Prince of Bei-jing asking to see him ! A feeling of pleasant anticipation filled him as he hurried forward with his father ."
一面 走 ， 一面 瞥见 那 北静王 坐在 轿 内 ， 好 个 仪表 。,"He peeped up at the prince as they advanced and saw that he was , as report had painted him , an extremely good-looking young man ."
不知 近前 又 是 怎样 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"But if you want to know about his interview with the handsome prince , you will have to read about it in the next chapter ."
第十五回,Chapter 15
王凤姐 弄权 铁槛 寺,At Water-moon Priory Xi-feng finds how much profit may be procured by the abuse of power
秦鲸卿 得趣 馒头 庵,And Qin Zhong discovers the pleasures that are to be had under the cover of darkness
话 说 宝玉 举目 见 北静王 〈 水溶 〉 头上 戴 着 净白 簪缨 银翅王 帽 ， 穿着 江牙 海水 五爪龙 白 蟒袍 ， 系 着 碧玉 红 鞓 带 ； 面 如 美玉 ， 目 似 明星 ： 真 好 秀丽 人物 。,"Looking up , Bao-yu saw that Shui Rong 's princely headgear was embellished by way of mourning with white bands , a white hatpin , and filigree silver ' wings ' . As a further token of mourning his robe , though heavily bordered with a ' tooth and wave ' design of rainbowcoloured stripes and gold-emblazoned with the royal five-clawed dragon , was of a white material . It was confined at the waist by a red leather belt , studded with green jade . The splendid costume , the luminous eyes , the finely chiselled features really did make him an arrestingly handsome young man ."
宝玉 忙 抢 上来 参见 ， 水溶 从 轿 内 伸手 搀住 。,"Bao-yu started forward impulsively to make his salutation , but the prince extended an arm from the palanquin and prevented him from kneeling ."
见 宝玉 戴 着 束发 银冠 ， 勒 着 双龙 出海 抹额 ， 穿着 白 蟒箭袖 ， 围着 攒 珠 银带 ； 面 若 春花 ， 目 如 点 漆 。 北静王 笑 道 ： “ 名不虚传 ， 果然 如 ‘ 宝 ’ 似 ‘ 玉 ’ 。 ”,"Bao-yu was wearing a little silver coronet on the top of his head and a silver headband round his brow in the form of two dragons emerging from the sea . He had on a narrow-sleeved , full-skirted robe of white material and a silver belt inlaid with pearls . After studying these and admiring the flowerlike face and coal-black eyes , the prince 's face broke into a smile . ' If "" Bao-yu "" means "" precious jade "" , you are appropriately named , ' he said ."
问 ： “ 衔 的 那宝贝 在 那里 ？ ”,' But where is the famous stone you were born with ? '
宝玉 见 问 ， 连忙 从 衣 内 取出 ， 递 与 北静王 细细 看 了 ， 又 念 了 那 上头 的 字 ， 因 问 ： “ 果 灵验 否 ？ ”,"Bao-yu hurriedly extracted the jade from inside his clothing and taking it off , handed it to the prince , who scrutinized it carefully , reciting the words of the inscription as he deciphered them . ' And does it really have these powers ? ' he asked ."
贾政忙 道 ： “ 虽 如此 说 ， 只是 未曾 试 过 。 ”,"' It is only alleged to , ' Jia Zheng put in hastily . ' We have never put them to the test . '"
北静王 一面 极 口 称奇 ， 一面 理顺 彩绦 ， 亲自 与 宝玉 带上 ， 又 携手 问宝玉 几岁 ， 现读 何书 。,The prince pronounced the stone a great wonder and with his own hands refastened its plaited silken cord round Bao-yu 's neck .
宝玉 一一 答应 。,"Then , taking one of Bao-yu 's hands in his own , he asked him how old he was , what books he was studying , and other such questions , to all of which Bao-yu gave prompt replies ."
北静王 见 他 语言 清朗 ， 谈吐 有 致 ， 一面 又 向 贾政笑 道 ： “ 令郎 真 乃 龙驹凤雏 ， 非小 王在世 翁 前 唐突 ， 将来 ‘ 雏凤 清 于 老凤声 ’ ， 未 可量 也 。 ”,"Delighted that everything Bao-yu said was so clear and to the point , the prince observed to Jia Zheng that ' the young phoenix was worthy of his sire ' . ' I trust I shall not offend you by saying so to your face , ' he said , ' but I venture to prophesy that this fledgling of yours will one day "" sing sweeter than the parent bird "" . '"
贾政陪 笑 道 ： “ 犬子 岂敢 谬 承 金奖 ， 赖藩郡 余恩 ， 果如所言 ， 亦 荫 生辈 之 幸 矣 。 ”,"Jia Zheng smiled politely . ' My son is doubtless unworthy of the compliment Your Highness is good enough to pay him . If thanks to your encouragement , he turns out as you say , we shall count ourselves truly fortunate . '"
北静王 又 道 ： “ 只是 一件 ：,"' There is only one drawback in possessing such charm , ' said the prince ."
令郎 如此 资质 ， 想 老太 夫人 自然 钟爱 ； 但 吾辈 后生 ， 甚 不宜 溺爱 ， 溺爱 则 未免 荒失 了 学业 。,"' I am sure it must make his grandmother dote upon him ; and , unfortunately , being the object of too much affection is very bad for people of our years . It leads us to neglect our studies ."
昔 小王 曾蹈此辙 ， 想 令郎 亦 未必 不如 是 也 。,"This used at one time to be the case with me , and I suspect is now the case with your son ."
若 令郎 在家 难以 用功 ， 不妨 常 到 寒 邸 ， 小王 虽 不 才 ， 却 多 蒙 海内 众 名士 凡至 都 者 ， 未有 不 垂青 目的 。,"If he does find difficulty in working at home , he would be very welcome to come round to my palace . I do not pretend to be a gifted person myself but I am fortunate in counting distinguished writers from all over the empire among my acquaintances , and my palace is a rendezvous for them when they are in the capital , so that I never want for intellectual company ."
是 以 寒邸 高人 颇 聚 ， 令郎 常 去 谈谈 会 会 ， 则 学问 可以 日 进 矣 。 ”,"By constantly mixing and conversing with such people at my palace , your son could do much to improve his education . '"
贾政忙 躬身 答道 ： “ 是 。 ”,' Yes . ' Jia Zheng bowed deferentially .
北静王 又 将 腕上 一串 念珠 卸下来 ， 递 与 宝玉 ， 道 ： “ 今日 初 会 ， 仓卒 无 敬贺 之物 ， 此 系 圣上 所 赐 蕶 苓 香 念珠 一串 ， 权 为 贺敬之 礼 。 ”,"The Prince of Bei-jing removed a rosary from his wrist and handed it to Bao-yu . ' Today is our first meeting , but as it was an unforeseen one , I have not come prepared with a suitable gift . All I can offer you is this rosary made of the aromatic seeds of some Indian plant . It was given me by his Imperial Majesty . I hope you will accept it as a little token of my esteem . '"
宝玉 连忙 接 了 ， 回身 奉 与 贾政 。,"Bao-yu took the rosary and turning back offered it respectfully to Jia Zheng , who made his son join him in formally thanking the prince for his gift ."
贾政 带 着 宝玉 谢 过 了 。,At this point Jia She and Cousin Zhen knelt before the prince and invited him to return .
于是 贾 赦 、 贾珍 等 一齐 上来 叩请 回 舆 ， 北静王 道 ： “ 逝者 已 登 仙界 ， 非 你 我 碌碌 尘寰 中 人 。,"' The Departed is now in paradise , ' said the prince ."
小王 虽 上叨 天恩 ， 虚 邀 郡 袭 ， 岂可 越仙 𮝵 而 进 呢 ？ ”,"' Though I enjoy imperial favour and princely rank , I would not presume to go past her carriage . Heavenly honours take precedence over earthly ones ! '"
贾 赦等 见 执意不从 ， 只得 谢恩 回来 ， 命 手下人 掩乐 停音 ， 将 殡过 完 ， 方 让 北静王 过去 。,"When they saw that the prince was adamant , Jia She and the rest bowed their thanks , then , having ordered the musicians to vail their instruments and march by in silence , they caused the front part of the procession and the hearse to pass over the junction . As soon as the hearse had gone over , the prince and his retinue crossed in the other direction , after which the rear part of the procession moved forward and caught up with the rest ."
不在话下 。,
且说 宁府 送殡 ， 一路 热闹 非常 。 刚至 城门 ， 又 有 贾 赦 、 贾政 、 贾珍 诸同寅 属下 各家 祭棚 接祭 ， 一一 的 谢过 ， 然后 出 城 ， 竟 奔 铁槛 寺 大路 而 来 。,"The liveliness which attended the procession during the whole of its progress through the city reached a climax as it approached the city gate , for it was along this last stretch that the colleagues and office juniors of Jia She , Jia Zheng and Cousin Zhen had arranged their bowers , and it was necessary to stop and thank each one of them as they made their offerings to the passing hearse . They did at last succeed in getting out of the city gate , however , after which a clear road lay ahead all the way to the Temple of the Iron Threshold ."
彼时 贾珍 带 着 贾蓉 来到 诸 长辈 前 让 坐轿 上马 ， 因而 贾 赦 一辈 的 各自 上 了 车 轿 ， 贾珍 一辈 的 也 将要 上马 ；,"Cousin Zhen went round with Jia Rong to the senior men among the mourners and invited them to proceed from there onwards by the transport provided . The upshot was that those of Jia She is generation got into carriages and sedans , while Cousin Zhen and the younger men mounted on horseback ."
凤姐 因 惦记着 宝玉 ， 怕 他 在 郊外 纵性 不服 家人 的话 ， 贾政 管不着 ， 惟恐 有 闪失 ， 因此 命 小厮 来 唤 他 。 宝玉 只 得到 他 车 前 。,"Xi-feng was worried about Bao-yu . Out in the country , she thought , he was liable to become wild and disobedient . She felt sure that he would get up to some kind of mischief now that he was removed from Jia Zheng 's restraint . Accordingly she sent one of her pages to summon him , and presently he rode up to her carriage ."
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 好 兄弟 ， 你 是 个 尊贵 人 ， 和 女孩儿 似的 人品 ， 别学 他们 猴 在 马上 。,"' Bao dear , ' said Xi-feng , ' a person of your refinement belongs here with us . You do not want to go clomping around the countryside like apes on horseback with those horrid men !"
下来 ， 咱们 姐儿 两个 同 坐车 ， 好不好 ？ ”,Why not get in with me ? The two of us will keep each other company . '
宝玉 听说 ， 便下 了 马 ， 爬 上 凤姐 车内 ， 二人 说 笑 前进 。,"Bao-yu at once dismounted and climbed up into the carriage , and the two of them drove on , laughing and chattering as they went ."
不 一时 ， 只见 那边 两 骑马 直奔 凤姐 车 来 ， 下马 扶车 回道 ： “ 这里 有 下处 ， 奶奶 请 歇歇 更衣 。 ”,"They had not been driving very long when two horsemen galloped up beside them , dismounted , and leaning into the carriage , informed Xi-feng that they were now near her stopping-place , in case she wished to get out and ' stretch her legs ' ."
凤姐命 请 邢王二 夫人 示下 ， 那 二人 回说 ： “ 太太 们 说 不 歇 了 ， 叫 奶奶 自便 。 ”,"Xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask Lady Xing and Lady Wang for instructions . The latter sent back word that they had no desire to stop , themselves , but that Xi-feng was welcome to do so if she wished ."
凤姐 便命 歇歇 再 走 。,Xi-feng accordingly gave orders for a short halt .
小厮 带 着 轿马 岔出 人群 ， 往 北 而 来 。,At once the pages led the horses out of the main stream of traffic and headed northwards down a small side-road .
宝玉 忙 命 人 去 请 秦钟 。 那时 秦钟正 骑着马 随 他 父亲 的 轿 ， 忽 见 宝玉 的 小厮 跑 来 请 他 去 打尖 ， 秦钟远 看着 宝玉 所骑 的 马 ， 搭 着 鞍笼 ， 随着 凤姐 的 车 往 北 而 去 ， 便 知 宝玉 同凤姐 一车 ， 自己 也 带 马 赶上来 ， 同入 一庄 门内 。,"Bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetch Qin Zhong , who was riding along behind his father 's sedan . As the page came hurrying up and asked him to stop with Bao-yu for a little refreshment , he turned round and saw Bao-yu 's horse in the distance , jogging along in a northerly direction with an empty saddle on its back behind Xi-feng 's carriage , and he realized that Bao-yu must be inside the carriage with Xi-feng . Turning his horse 's head about , he hurried after , and followed them into the gateway of a farm ."
那庄 农 人家 ， 无多 房舍 ， 妇女 无处 回避 ； 那些 村姑 野妇 见 了 凤姐 、 宝玉 、 秦钟 的 人品 衣服 ， 几疑 天人 下降 。,"Apart from the barns and outhouses , the farmhouse consisted of little more than a single large room , so that there was nowhere the farmer 's womenfolk could go to be out of the way of the visitors . The sudden appearance in their midst of Xi-feng , Bao-yu and Qin Zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one ."
凤姐 进入 茅屋 ， 先命 宝玉 等 出去 玩玩 。,"As soon as they were inside the thatched central building , Xi-feng asked the boys to amuse themselves outside ."
宝玉 会意 ， 因 同 秦钟 带 了 小厮 们 各处 游玩 。,"Bao-yu realized that she needed to be alone , and conducted Qin Zhong and the pages on a tour of the farmyard ."
凡 庄家 动用 之物 ， 俱 不曾 见 过 的 ， 宝玉 见 了 ， 都 以为 奇 ， 不知 何名 何用 。,"He had never in his life seen any of the farming implements before , and was very curious ."
小厮 中 有 知道 的 ， 一一 告诉 了 名色 并 其 用处 。,One of his pages who had some experience of country matters was able to name each implement for him and explain its functions .
宝玉 听 了 ， 因 点头 道 ： “ 怪 道 古人 诗 上 说 ： ‘ 谁知盘中餐 ， 粒粒皆辛苦 ！ ’,Bao-yu was impressed .
正 为此 也 。 ”,"' Now I can understand the words of the old poet , ' he said : ' Each grain of rice we ever ate Cost someone else a drop of sweat . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 又 到 一间 房 内 ， 见 炕 上 有个 纺车 儿 ， 越发 以为 稀奇 。,At that moment they came to an outhouse in which was a kang with a spinning-wheel on it . Bao-yu was even more intrigued .
小厮 们 又 说 ： “ 是 纺线 织布 的 。 ”,"' That is for spinning yarn with to make cloth out of , ' said the pages ."
宝玉 便 上 炕 摇转 ， 只见 一个 村妆 丫头 ， 约 有 十七八岁 ， 走来 说道 ： “ 别 弄坏了 ！ ”,Bao-yu at once got up on the kang and had just started to turn it when a country lass of seventeen or eighteen summers came running up : ' Do not ! You will spoil it ! '
众 小厮 忙 上来 吆喝 ， 宝玉 也 住 了 手 ， 说道 ： “ 我 因 没有 见 过 ， 所以 试一试 玩儿 。 ”,"She was shouted at fiercely by the pages , but Bao-yu had already stayed his hand . ' I am sorry I have never seen one before . I was just turning it for fun , to see how it works . '"
那丫头 道 ： “ 你 不会 转 ， 等 我 转给 你 瞧 。 ”,"' You do not know how to turn it properly , ' said the girl . ' Let me show you how ' tis done '"
秦钟暗拉 宝玉 道 ： “ 此 卿 大 有 意趣 。 ”,"Qin Zhong gave Bao-yu a sly tug : ' A comely damosel , thinkest thou nottest ? '"
宝玉 推 他 道 ： “ 再 胡说 ， 我 就 打 了 ！ ”,"' Shut up , or I will clout you ! ' said Bao-yu , pushing him ."
说 着 ， 只见 那丫头 纺起线 来 ， 果然 好看 。,"During this muttered exchange the girl had begun spinning . She did , indeed , make a charming picture as she bent over her work ."
忽 听 那边 老婆子 叫 道 ： “ 二 丫头 ， 快 过来 ！ ”,Suddenly an old woman 's voice called out from the other side of the yard : ' Ertie ! Come here at once my gal . '
那丫头 丢 了 纺车 ， 一 径 去 了 。,The girl jumped up from her spinning and hurried over .
宝玉 怅然 无趣 。,Bao-yu is spirits were quite dashed by her abrupt departure .
只见 凤姐 打发 人 来 叫 他 两个 进去 。,But just then someone came from Xi-feng inviting the boys indoors .
凤姐 洗 了 手 ， 换 了 衣服 ， 问 他 换 不换 ， 宝玉 道 ： “ 不 换 。 ”,"They found her washed and changed . She asked them if they wanted to ' change ' too , but Bao-yu replied that they did not ."
也 就 罢了 。,
仆妇 们 端 上 茶食 果品 来 ， 又 倒 上 香茶 来 ， 凤姐 等 吃 了 茶 ， 待 他们 收拾 完备 ， 便 起身 上车 。,"Then a variety of cakes and sweets were brought in by the servants , and fragrant tea was poured for them to drink . When the three had taken their fill of these refreshments and everything had been cleared away and repacked by the servants , they rose up and got back into their carriage ."
外面 旺儿 预备 赏封 ， 赏 了 那 庄户人家 ， 那 妇人 等 忙 来 谢赏 。,"Outside in the yard Brightie handed the farmer 's family their payment , which he had brought with him ready-wrapped in coloured paper , and the womenfolk hurried up to the carriage to express their thanks ."
宝玉 留心 看 时 ， 并 不见 纺线 之 女 。,"Bao-yu scanned their faces carefully , but could not see his spinning-girl amongst them ."
走 不多 远 ， 却 见 这 二 丫头 ， 怀里 抱 着 个 小孩子 ， 同着 两个 小 女孩子 ， 在 村头 站 着 瞅 他 。,"They had not driven far , however , when he caught sight of her at the end of the village . She was standing watching for him beside the road , a baby brother in her arms and two little girls at her side ."
宝玉 情不自禁 ， 然 身 在 车上 ， 只得 眼角 留情 而已 。 一时 电卷 风驰 ， 回头 已 无 踪迹 了 。,"Bao-yu could not repress a strong emotion on seeing her , but sitting there in the carriage there was not much he could do but gaze back at her soulfully ; and soon , as the carriage bowled along at a smarter pace , Ertie was lost to sight for ever ."
说 笑间 ， 已 赶上 大 殡 。,"With talk and laughter to beguile them , the journey passed quickly ."
早 又 前面 法 鼓金 铙 ， 幢 幡 宝盖 ： 铁槛 寺中 僧众 摆列 路旁 。,Soon they had caught up with the main procession ; soon the sound of drums and cymbals was heard and they could see ahead of them the banners and umbrellas of the monks from the Temple of the Iron Threshold who had come out in procession and lined either side of the road to welcome them ;
少时 到 了 寺中 ， 另 演 佛事 ， 重设 香坛 ， 安灵 于 内殿 偏室 之中 ， 宝珠 安理 寝室 为伴 。,"and soon they were inside the temple , where further ceremonies awaited them , a new staging having been erected for this purpose . The coffin was installed in one of the side-chapels leading off the inner hall , and Jewel arranged her sleeping-quarters near by to continue her watch over it ."
外面 贾珍 款待 一应 亲友 ， — — 也 有 坐住 的 ， 也 有 告辞 的 ， 一一 谢 了 乏 ， 从 公 、 侯 、 伯 、 子 、 男 ， 一起 一起 的 ， 散 至 未末 方散 尽 了 。,"In the outer hall Cousin Zhen was busy attending to his guests , some of whom were staying on , while others wished to leave immediately . To each he tendered formal thanks for their trouble in coming . They left in order of seniority ; duke 's kin going first , then those of marquises , then those of earls , then those of viscounts , then those of barons , and so on downwards . It was three o'clock by the time the last of them had gone ."
里面 的 堂客 皆 是 凤姐 接待 ， 先 从 诰命 散起 ， 也 到 未正 上 下方 散完 了 。,"Xi-feng received the lady guests inside . They , too , left in order of precedence and had not finally dispersed until around two o'clock ."
只有 几个 近亲 本 族 ， 等 做 过 三日 道场 方去 的 。,Only members of the clan and a few very close friends stayed behind to see the ceremonies through to their conclusion two days later .
那时 邢王二 夫人 知 凤姐 必 不能 回家 ， 便 要 带 了 宝玉 同 进城 去 。,Lady Xing and Lady Wang were among those who left . They could see that Xi-feng would be unable to return that day and wanted to take Bao-yu back with them into town .
那宝玉 乍 到 郊外 ， 那里 肯回去 ？ 只要 跟着 凤姐 住 着 ， 王夫人 只得 交与 凤姐 而 去 。,"But Bao-yu , after his first taste of the countryside , was extremely loth to return and begged to stay with Xi-feng ; so Lady Wang went without him , leaving him in Xi-feng 's charge ."
原来 这 铁槛 寺 是 宁荣二 公 当日 修造 的 ， 现今 还有 香火 地 亩 ， 以备 京 中 老 了 人口 ， 在 此 停灵 。,The Temple of the Iron Threshold was a private foundation of the Dukes of Ning-guo and Rong-guo which still had some land of its own in which members of the clan who died in the capital could be given temporary burial .
其中 阴阳 两 宅 俱 是 预备 妥贴 的 ， 好 为 送灵 人口 寄居 。,"The thoughtful Dukes had provided accommodation not only for the dead but also for the living , in the form of guest-rooms in which mourners might temporarily reside until their funereal business was over ."
不想 如今 后人 繁盛 ， 其中 贫富 不 一 ， 或 性情 参商 ： 有 那家 道 艰难 的 ， 便 住 在 这里 了 ； 有 那 有钱有势 尚 排场 的 ， 只 说 这里 不 方便 ， 一定 另外 或 村庄 ， 或 尼庵 ， 寻 个 下处 ， 为 事毕 宴退 之 所 。,"What the old gentlemen had not foreseen was that their multitudinous progeny would come in time to exhibit differences of wealth and temperament so extreme as often to render their possessors mutually intolerable and that , whereas the more hard-up members of the clan gladly occupied the accommodation provided , the more affluent or pretentious found it ' inconvenient ' to stay there and preferred to seek alternative accommodation in the farmsteads and convents round about ."
即今 秦氏 之 丧 ， 族 中 诸人 ， 也 有 在 铁槛 寺 的 ， 也 有别 寻 下处 的 。 凤姐 也 嫌 不 方便 ， 因 遣 人 来 和 馒头 庵 的 姑子 静虚 说 了 ， 腾出 几间 房 来 预备 。,"Xi-feng was among those who found the Iron Threshold accommodation ' inconvenient ' . Some time previously she had sent someone to Wheatcake Priory to make arrangements on her behalf with the prioress Euergesia , and the old nun had turned out several rooms in readiness for her arrival ."
— — 原来 这 馒头 庵 和 水 月 寺 一势 ， 因 他 庙里 做 的 馒头 好 ， 就 起 了 这个 浑号 ； 离 铁槛 寺 不远 。,"' Wheatcake Priory ' ( so-called because of the excellent steamed wheatbread made in its kitchens ) was the popular name for Water-moon Priory , an offshoot of Water-moon Abbey situated at no great distance from the Temple of the Iron Threshold ."
当下 和尚 工课 已 完 ， 奠过 晚 茶 ， 贾珍便 命 贾蓉 请 凤姐 歇息 。,"Presently , when the monks had finished their service and the evening offering of tea had been made , Cousin Zhen sent Jia Rong in to Xi-feng with a message inviting her to retire ."
凤姐 见 还有 几个 妯娌 们 陪 着 女亲 ， 自己 便 辞 了 众人 ， 带 着 宝玉 秦钟 往 馒头 庵 来 。,"Having first glanced round to ascertain that a sufficient number of Jia ladies were present to look after the still remaining guests , Xi-feng bade the company good night and left for Wheatcake Priory with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong ."
只 因 秦邦业 年迈 多 病 ， 不能 在 此 ， 只 命 秦钟 等待 安灵 罢 ， 所以 秦钟 只 跟着 凤姐 宝玉 。,"Qin Zhong had attached himself to the other two when his father Qin Bang-ye , unable by reason of his age and frail state of health to risk a night away from home , had gone back to the city , leaving him to await the conclusion of the requiem services on his own ."
一时 到 了 庵 中 ， 静虚 带领 智善 、 智能 两个 徒弟 出来 迎接 ， 大家 见 过 。,"They soon arrived at the priory and were met by Euergesia , who had brought her two little disciples Benevolentia and Sapientia to welcome them ."
凤姐 等 至 净室 更衣 净手 毕 ， 因见 智能 儿 越发 长 高 了 ， 模样儿 越发 出息 的 水灵 了 ， 因 说道 ： “ 你们 师徒 怎么 这些 日子 也 不往 我们 那里 去 ？ ”,"As soon as the first greetings were over , Xi-feng retired to her room to wash and change . Emerging refreshed , she observed how much taller Sapientia had grown and how radiantly good-looking , and inquired of Euergesia why she and her two charges had lately not been into town to see them ."
静虚道 ： “ 可是 这 几日 因 胡老爷 府 里 产 了 公子 ， 太太 送 了 十两 银子 来 这里 ， 叫 请 几位 师父 念 三日 ‘ 血盆 经 ’ ， 忙 的 就 没 得来 请 奶奶 的 安 。 ”,"' It is on account of Mr Hu is good lady , ' said the old nun . ' She has lately been brought to bed of a boy , and sent us ten taels of silver for a three-day recital of the Lake of Blood shtra by some of the sisters to purge the stain of childbirth . We have been so busy with the arrangements that we haven ' t had time to call . '"
不言 老尼 陪 着 凤姐 ， 且说 那秦钟 宝玉 二人 正在 殿上 玩耍 ， 因见 智能 儿 过来 ， 宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 能儿 来 了 。 ”,"Let us leave Xi-feng in conversation with the prioress and turn to the other two . Qin Zhong and Bao-yu were amusing themselves in the main hall of the priory when Sapientia happened to pass through . ' Here 's Sappy , ' said Bao-yu with a meaningful smile ."
秦钟 说 ： “ 理 他 作 什么 ？ ”,"' Well , what about it ? ' said Qin Zhong ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 别 弄鬼 儿 ！ 那 一日 在 老太太 屋里 ， 一个 人 没有 ， 你 搂 着 他 作 什么 呢 ？,"' Now , now , stop play-acting ! ' said Bao-yu . ' I saw you holding her that day at Grandma 's when you thought nobody else was about ."
这 会子 还 哄 我 ！ ”,You need not think you can fool me after that ! '
秦钟笑 道 ： “ 这 可是 没有 的话 。 ”,' I do not know what you are talking about . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 有没有 也 不管 你 ， 你 只 叫 他 倒 碗 茶 来 我 喝 ， 就 撂 过手 。 ”,"' All right then . Never mind whether you know what I am talking about or not . Just ask her to pour me out a cup of tea , will you , and then we will let the subject drop . '"
秦钟笑 道 ： “ 这 又 奇 了 ！,' What sort of joke is this ?
你 叫 他 倒 去 ， 还怕 他 不 倒 ？,Why can not you ask her yourself ? She would pour it out just the same for you .
何用 我 说 呢 ！ ”,Why ask me to tell her ? '
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 叫 他 倒 的 是 无 情意 的 ， 不及 你 叫 他 倒 的 是 有 情意 的 。 ”,' I could not do it with the same feeling as you . There will be much more feeling in it if you ask her . '
秦钟 没法 ， 只得 说道 ： “ 能儿 倒 碗 茶 来 。 ”,"He finally prevailed upon Qin Zhong to make the request . ' Oh , all right ! - Sappy , pour us a cup of tea , will you ? '"
那 能 儿 自幼 在 荣府 走动 ， 无人 不 识 ， 常和 宝玉 秦钟 玩笑 ， 如今 长大 了 ， 渐 知 风月 ， 便 看上 了 秦钟 人物 风流 ， 那秦钟 也 爱 他 妍 媚 ， 二人 虽 未上 手 ， 却 已 情投意合 了 。,"Sapientia had been a regular visitor at the Rong-guo mansion ever since she was a little girl and was familiar with all its inmates . The innocence of her childish rompings with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong had latterly , however - now that she had reached adolescence - given way to a more mature emotion . She had fallen in love with Qin Zhong , whose every feature and lineament now inspired her with romantic feelings ; and Qin Zhong , captivated by her developing charms , had responded by loving her back . Although nothing serious had as yet passed between them , in their inclinations and affections they were already united ."
智能 走 去 倒 了 茶 来 。,Sapientia hurried out and returned with a cup of tea .
秦钟笑 说 ： “ 给 我 。 ”,"' Give it to me , Sappy said Qin Zhong ."
宝玉 又 叫 ： “ 给 我 ！ ”,"' No , give it to me , Sappy ! ' said Bao-yu ."
智能 儿 抿着嘴 儿 笑 道 ： “ 一碗 茶 也 争 ， 难道 我 手上 有蜜 ！ ”,"She stood between them , pouting prettily , and gave a little laugh : ' Surely you are not going to fight over a cup of tea ? I must have honey on my hands ! '"
宝玉 先 抢着 了 ， 喝 着 ， 方要 问话 ， 只见 智善 来 叫 智能 去 摆 果 碟子 ， 一时 来 请 他 两个 去 吃 果茶 。,Bao-yu snatched the cup before Qin Zhong could do so and began drinking . He was about to say something when Benevolentia came in and fetched Sapientia away to help her lay the table . She was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and cakes ;
他 两个 那里 吃 这些 东西 ？ 略 坐坐 仍 出来 玩耍 。,"but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts , and after sitting a short while for the sake of politeness , were soon off to amuse themselves elsewhere ."
凤姐 也 便 回至 净室 歇息 ， 老尼 相伴 。,"Xi-feng , too , soon left , and retired to her private room to rest , Euergesia accompanying her ."
此时 众 婆子 媳妇 见 无 事 ， 都 陆续 散 了 ， 自去 歇息 ， 跟前 不过 几个 心腹 小丫头 ， 老尼 便 趁机 说道 ： “ 我 有 一事 ， 要 到 府 里 求 太太 ， 先 请 奶奶 的 示下 。 ”,"By this time the older servants , seeing that there was nothing further for them to do , had one by one drifted off to bed , leaving only a few personal maids , all of whom were in Xi-feng 's confidence , in attendance . The old nun deemed it safe to broach a private matter in their hearing . ' There is something I have been meaning to call at your house and ask Her Ladyship about , but I should like to have your opinion on it first before I see her . '"
凤姐 问道 ： “ 什么 事 ？ ”,' What do you want to ask her ? ' said Xi-feng .
老尼 道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！,' Bless his Holy Name ! ' the prioress began piously .
只 因 当日 我 先 在 长安县 善才 庵 里 出家 的 时候 儿 ， 有个 施主 姓张 ， 是 大 财主 。 他 的 女孩儿 小名 金哥 ， 那年 都 往 我 庙里 来 进香 ， 不想 遇见 长安 府 太爷 的 小舅子 李 少爷 。 那 李 少爷 一眼 看见 金哥 就 爱 上 了 ， 立刻 打发 人 来 求亲 ， 不想 金哥 已 受 了 原 任长安 守备 公子 的 聘定 。,"' When I was a nun at the Treasures in Heaven Convent in Chang-an , one of the convent 's benefactors was a very wealthy man called Zhang , who had a daughter called Jin-ge . A certain young Mr Li , who is brother-in-law to the Governor of Chang-an , met her once when she was making an incense-offering in our temple and took a violent liking to her . He at once sent someone to the parents to ask for her hand in marriage , but unfortunately she was already betrothed to the son of a captain in the Chang-an garrison and the betrothal-presents had already been accepted ."
张家 欲 待 退亲 ， 又 怕 守备 不依 ， 因此 说 已有 了 人家 了 。,"The Zhangs would have liked to cancel the betrothal but were afraid that the captain would object , so they told Lis matchmaker that the girl was already engaged ."
谁知 李 少爷 一定 要 娶 ， 张家 正在 没法 ， 两处 为难 ；,"But oh dear ! young Mr Li would not take no for an answer , and the Zhangs were quite at their wit is end , being now in trouble with both parties ."
不料 守备 家 听见 此信 ， 也 不问青红皂白 ， 就 来 吵闹 ， 说 ： ‘ 一个 女孩儿 你 许 几家 子 人家 儿 ？ ’,"You see , when the captain got to hear of these goings-on he was most unreasonable . He came rushing along in a great rage and made a most terrible scene . "" Just how many young men is this girl betrothed to ? "" he said , and so on and so forth ."
偏 不许 退 定礼 ， 就 打起 官司 来 。,He refused outright to take back the betrothal-gifts and straightway began an action for breach of promise .
女家 急 了 ， 只得 着 人 上京 找门路 ， 赌气 偏要 退 定礼 。,"By now the Zhangs were really upset and sent to the capital for some moral support - for they are now quite determined to break off their daughter 's engagement , seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable ."
我 想 如今 长安 节度 云老爷 ， 和 府上 相好 ， 怎么 求 太太 和 老爷 说 说 ， 写 一 封书子 ， 求 云老爷 和 那 守备 说 一声 ， 不怕 他 不依 。,"' Well , it occurred to me that the Area Commander for Chang-an , General Yun , is on very good terms with your husband 's family , and I thought I might try to find some way of persuading Her Ladyship to talk to Sir Zheng about this and get him to write a letter to General Yun and ask him to have a word with this captain . It is hardly likely that he would refuse to obey his commanding officer ."
要是 肯行 ， 张家 那 怕 倾家 孝顺 ， 也 是 情愿 的 。 ”,The Zhangs would gladly pay anything - even if it meant bankrupting themselves - in return for this kindness . '
凤姐 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 这事 倒 不大 。,Xi-feng laughed . ' It does not sound very difficult .
只是 太太 再 不管 这些 事 。 ”,The only difficulty is that Lady Wang does not touch this kind of thing any more . '
老尼 道 ： “ 太太 不管 ， 奶奶 可以 主张 了 。 ”,"' If Her Ladyship will not , what about you , Mrs Lian ? ' Xi-feng laughed again ."
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 我 也 不 等 银子 使 ， 也 不 做 这样 的 事 。 ”,"' I am not short of money ; and besides , I do not touch that sort of thing either . '"
静虚 听 了 ， 打 去 妄想 ， — — 半晌 叹 道 ： “ 虽 这么 说 ， 只是 张家 已经 知道 求 了 府 里 。,"Euergesia 's face assumed an expression of great benignity . After sitting for a while in silence she sighed . ' It is a pity I let the Zhangs know that I was going to talk to you about this , ' she said ."
如今 不管 ， 张家 不 说 没工夫 、 不 希图 他 的 谢礼 ， 倒 象 府 里 连 这 点子 手段 也 没有 似的 。 ”,"' Now if you do not do this favour for them , they will never believe that it is because you haven ' t the time or do not want the money ; they will take it as a sign that you are not able . '"
凤姐 听 了 这话 ， 便 发 了 兴头 ， 说道 ： “ 你 是 素日 知道 我 的 ， 从来不 信 什么 阴司 地狱 报应 的 ；,"This put Xi-feng on her mettle . ' You have known me a long time , ' she said . ' You know that I have never believed all that talk about hell and damnation ."
凭 是 什么 事 ， 我 说 要行 就 行 。,"If I decide that I want to do something I do it , no matter what it is ."
你 叫 他 拿 三千两 银子 来 ， 我 就 替 他 出 这 口气 。 ”,"Tell them that if they are prepared to pay out three thousand taels of silver , I will undertake to relieve them of their trouble . '"
老尼 听说 ， 喜之 不胜 ， 忙 说 ： “ 有 ！ 有 ！ 这个 不难 。 ”,The prioress was delighted . ' They will ! They will ! No doubt about it ! '
凤姐 又 道 ： “ 我 比 不得 他们 扯篷拉纤 的 图 银子 。,"' Mind you , ' said Xi-feng , ' I am not one of your money-grubbing run-of-the-mill gobetweens . I am not doing this for the money ."
这 三千两 银子 ， 不过 是 给 打发 说去 的 小厮 们 作 盘缠 ， 使 他 赚 几个 辛苦 钱儿 ； 我 一个 钱 也 不要 。,Every bit of this three thousand taels will go into the pockets of my boys or towards their expenses . I shall not touch a penny of it .
就是 三万两 我 此刻 还 拿 的 出来 。 ”,"If it was money I wanted , I could lay my hands on thirty thousand taels at this very moment . '"
老尼 忙 答应 道 ： “ 既 如此 ， 奶奶 明日 就 开恩 罢了 。 ”,"' Well , that is nicely settled ! ' said the prioress . ' So can we look forward to your kind help in this matter tomorrow ? We may as well get it over and done with . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 你 瞧瞧 我 忙 的 ， 那 一处 少 的 了 我 ？,"' You can see how busy I am and how impossible it is for me to get away , ' said Xi-feng ."
我 既 应 了 你 ， 自然 给 你 了结 啊 。 ”,"' I have told you I will do it , and so I will - in my own time . Surely that is enough for you ? '"
老尼 道 ： “ 这 点子 事 ， 要 在 别人 ， 自然 忙 的 不知 怎么样 ； 要是 奶奶 跟前 ， 再 添 上 些 ， 也 不够 奶奶 一办 的 。,"' A little thing like this might seem a great deal of trouble to some people , ' said the old nun artfully , ' but even if it involved more than it does , it would still be nothing to a capable person like you , Mrs Lian ."
俗语说 的 ： ‘ 能者多劳 。 ’ 太太 见 奶奶 这样 才情 ， 越发 都 推给 奶奶 了 ， — — 只是 奶奶 也 要 保重 贵体 些 才 是 。 ”,"You know what they say : "" The able man gets little leisure "" - that is why Her Ladyship leaves everything to you . She knows how capable you are . Of course , you have to be careful that you do not overtax yourself . Your health is precious ! '"
一路 奉承 ， 凤姐 越发 受用 了 ， 也 不顾 劳乏 ， 更 攀谈 起来 。,"Soothed by such flatteries , Xi-feng forgot her weariness , and the conversation continued with animation ."
谁 想 秦钟趁 黑 晚 无人 ， 来 寻 智能 儿 。,Meanwhile Qin Zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that there was no one much about to prosecute his designs on Sapientia .
刚 到 后头 房里 ， 只见 智能 儿 独在 那里 洗 茶碗 。,He found her on her own in one of the rooms at the back of the priory washing up tea-things .
秦钟 便 搂 着 亲嘴 ， 智能 儿 急 的 跺脚 说 ： “ 这 是 做 什么 ？ ”,"Throwing his arms around her from behind , he gave her a kiss . Sapientia stamped with vexation : ' What are you doing ? Stop it ! '"
就要 叫唤 。 秦钟道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 我 要 急死了 ！,"She was about to call out , but Qin Zhong spoke entreatingly : ' Darling Sappy ! I want you so desperately !"
你 今儿 再 不依 我 ， 我 就 死 在 这里 。 ”,"If you will not let me , I will just lie down and die !"
智能 儿道 ： “ 你 要 怎么样 ， 除非 我 出 了 这 牢 坑 ， 离 了 这些 人 ， 才 好 呢 。 ”,"' If you want me , ' said Sapientia , ' you must first get me out of this hole and away from these people . Then you can do what you like . '"
秦钟道 ： “ 这 也 容易 ， 只是 ‘ 远水解 不得 近 渴 ’ — — ”,"' That is easy , ' said Qin Zhong . ' But "" distant water is no cure for a present thirst "" ... '"
说 着 一口 吹 了 灯 ， 满 屋里 漆黑 ， 将 智能 儿 抱到 炕上 。,"And with that he blew out the light , plunging the room into inky darkness , and carried Sapientia on to the kang ."
那 智能 儿 百般 的 扎挣 不 起来 ， 又 不好 嚷 ， 不知 怎么样 就 把 中 衣儿 解 下来 了 。 这里 刚才 入港 ， 说时迟 ， 那时快 ， 猛然间 一个 人 从 身后 冒冒失失 的 按住 ， 也 不出 声 ， 二人 唬 的 魂飞魄散 。,"She struggled hard to get up - though still not daring to call out ; but soon , almost before she knew it , her breech-clout was off and the ship was in the harbour . Suddenly , in less time than it takes to tell , a third person bore down on them from above and held them fast . The intruder made no sound , and for some moments the other two lay underneath his weight , half dead with fright ."
只 听 “ 嗤 ” 的 一 笑 ， 这 才 知 是 宝玉 。,Then there was a splutter of suppressed laughter and they knew that it was Bao-yu .
秦钟 连忙 起来 抱怨 道 ： “ 这 算 什么 ？ ”,"' What do you think you are playing at ? ' said Qin Zhong crossly , as he scrambled to his feet ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 倒 不依 ？ — — 咱们 就 嚷出来 。 ”,"' If you will not let me , darling , ' Bao-yu mimicked , ' I will call out ! '"
羞 的 智能 儿 趁 暗中 跑 了 。,Poor Sapientia was so overcome with shame that she slipped away in the dark .
宝玉 拉 着 秦钟 出来 道 ： “ 你 可 还 强嘴 不 强 ？ ”,"Bao-yu hauled Qin Zhong from the room . ' Now , ' he said : ' are you still going to pretend that Sappy means nothing to you ? '"
秦钟笑 道 ： “ 好 哥哥 ， 你 只别 嚷 ， 你 要 怎么着 都 使 的 。 ”,"' Look , be a good chap ! I will do anything you say as long as you promise not to shout . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 这 会子 也 不用说 ， 等 一会儿 睡 下 咱们 再 慢慢儿 的 算账 。 ”,"' We will not say any more about it just now , ' said Bao-yu genially . ' Wait until we are both in bed and I will settle accounts with you then . '"
一时 宽衣 安歇 的 时节 ， 凤姐 在 里间 ， 宝玉 秦钟 在 外间 ， 满 地下 皆 是 婆子 们 打 铺 坐 更 。 凤姐 因怕 “ 通灵玉 ” 失落 ， 等 宝玉 睡 下 ， 令人 拿来 捶 在 自己 枕边 。,"Bedtime soon came and they partially undressed and settled down for the night , Xi-feng in an inner room and Bao-yu and Qin Zhong in an outer room adjoining it . As there were numerous old women on night duty lying about everywhere on the floor wrapped up in their bedding , Xi-feng was afraid that the ' Magic Jade ' might disappear in the course of the night ; so as soon as Bao-yu was in bed she sent someone to fetch it from him , and put it under her own pillow for safety ."
却 不知 宝玉 和 秦钟 如何 算账 ， 未 见 真切 ， 此 系 疑案 ， 不敢 创纂 。,"As for the ' settling of accounts ' that Bao-yu had proposed to Qin Zhong , we have been unable to ascertain exactly what form this took ; and as we would not for the world be guilty of a fabrication , we must allow the matter to remain a mystery ."
且说 次日 一早 ， 便 有 贾母王 夫人 打发 了 人 来看 宝玉 ， 命 多 穿 两件 衣服 ， 无 事 宁可 回去 。,Next day someone arrived from Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to see how Bao-yu was getting on . He was counselled to dress up well against the cold and to come back home if there was nothing further to do .
宝玉 那里 肯 ？ 又 兼 秦钟 恋 着 智能 儿 ， 调唆 宝玉 求 凤姐 再 住 一天 。,"Bao-yu was most unwilling to return on his own account , and his unwillingness was reinforced by the promptings of Qin Zhong , who was anxious to see more of Sapientia and urged him to ask Xi-feng for another day ."
凤姐 想 了 一 想 ， 丧仪 大事 虽 妥 ， 还 有些 小事 ， 也 可以 再 住 一日 ：,"Xi-feng reflected a little . The main business of the funeral was now over , but a sufficient number of minor matters still remained to be done to justify their staying on another day if they wanted to ."
,Three arguments in favour of staying presented themselves to her mind :
一则 贾珍 跟前 送 了 满 情 ， 二则 又 可以 完 了 静虚 的 事 ， 三则 顺了 宝玉 的 心 〈 ， 贾母 听见 岂 不 欢喜 〉 ；,"1 . It would be a gesture of considerateness to Cousin Zhen which would increase his indebtedness to her . 2 . It would give her a breathing-space in which to get Euergesia 's business attended to . 3 . It would make Bao-yu happy , which would put her in good odour with Grandmother Jia ."
因此 便 向宝玉 道 ： “ 我 的 事 都 完 了 。 你 要 在 这里 逛 ， 少不得 索性 辛苦 了 。,"Having now made her mind up , Xi-feng acceded to Bao-yu 's request in the following terms : ' My own business here is all finished now , but if you want to amuse yourselves a bit longer , I suppose I must resign myself to staying ."
明儿 是 一定 要 走 的 了 。 ”,"However , we definitely must go back tomorrow . '"
宝玉 听说 ， 千 “ 姐姐 ” 、 万 “ 姐姐 ” 的 央求 ： “ 只 住 一日 ， 明儿 必 回去 的 。 ”,"When Bao-yu heard this it was all ' dearest Feng ' this and ' darling Feng ' that , and he promised faithfully to return on the morrow without demur ."
于是 又 住 了 一夜 。,Accordingly it was settled that they should stay for one more night .
凤姐 便命 悄悄 将 昨日 老尼 之 事 说 与 来旺儿 。,Xi-feng immediately sent someone in great secrecy to explain Euergesia 's business to Brightie .
旺儿 心中 俱 已 明白 ， 急忙 进城 ， 找 着 主文 的 相公 ， 假托 贾琏 所 嘱 ， 修书 一封 ， 连夜 往 长安县 来 。,"Brightie grasped the situation at once , hurried into town , sought out a public letter-writer , had a letter written in Jia Lian is name to the captain 's commanding officer , and set off for Chang-an overnight bearing the spurious missive with him ."
不过 百里 之遥 ， 两日 工夫 ， 俱 已 妥协 。,"Chang-an is only thirty or so miles from the capital , so that Brightie could finish his business and be back again within a couple of days ."
那 节度使 名唤 云光 ， 久 悬 贾府之 情 ， 这些 小事 ， 岂 有 不 允 之 理 ， 给 了 回书 ， 旺儿 回来 ， 不在话下 。,The general 's name was Yun Guang . He was indebted to the Jia family for a number of past kindnesses and was only too pleased to be of service to them in a matter of such trifling importance . He said as much in the letter of reply which he gave Brightie to carry back with him . But that part of his mission is omitted from our story .
且说 凤姐 等 又 过 了 一日 ， 次日 方别 了 老尼 ， 着 他 三日 后往 府 里 去 讨信 。,"When their second day at the priory was over , Xi-feng and the boys took leave of Euergesia , and as she said good-bye , Xi-feng told the prioress to call at the Rong-guo mansion in two days ' time to hear the news from Chang-an ."
那秦钟 和 智能 儿 两个 ， 百般 的 不忍 分离 ， 背地里 设 了 多少 幽期密约 ， 只得 含恨 而 别 ， 俱 不用 细述 。,"This parting was an unbearably painful one for Sapientia and Qin Zhong , and all sorts of secret vows were exchanged and whispered contracts made before they could tear themselves apart . We omit all details of that harrowing scene ."
凤姐 又 到 铁槛 寺中 照望 一番 。,Xi-feng called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on the way back to see that everything was in order .
宝珠 执意 不肯 回家 ， 贾珍 只得 派 妇女 相伴 。,"Jewel , it seemed , refused absolutely to go back home , and Cousin Zhen was obliged to leave a woman or two at the temple to keep her company ."
后事 如何 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"Their return , and the events which followed it , will be dealt with in the following chapter ."
第十六回,Chapter 16
贾元春 才 选 凤藻宫,Jia Yuan-chun is selected for glorious promotion to the Imperial Bedchamber
秦鲸卿 夭逝 黄泉路,And Qin Zhong is summoned for premature departure on the Journey into Night
且说 秦钟 宝玉 二人 跟着 凤姐 自 铁槛 寺 照应 一番 ， 坐车 进城 ， 到 家 见 过 贾母王 夫人 等 ， 回到 自己 房中 ， 一夜 无 话 。,"Xi-feng , Qin Zhong and Bao-yu , as we have said , called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on their way home . After looking round for a while , the three of them got back into their carriage and continued their journey into the city . Home once more , they first called on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then went off to their several rooms . But of the rest of that day and the night which followed , our story says nothing ."
至 次日 ， 宝玉 见 收拾 了 外 书房 ， 约定 了 和 秦钟念 夜 书 。,"Next morning Bao-yu found that his outer study had now been finished and was ready for use . He looked forward to beginning night-work in it with Qin Zhong , in accordance with a promise they had made each other ."
偏偏 那秦钟 秉赋 最弱 ， 因 在 郊外 受 了 些 风霜 ， 又 与 智能 儿 几次 偷期 缱绻 ， 未免 失 于 检点 ， 回来 时 便 咳嗽 伤风 ， 饮食 懒进 ， 大 有 不胜 之 态 ， 只 在 家中 调养 ， 不能 上学 ， 宝玉 便 扫 了 兴 ， 然 亦 无法 ， 只得 候 他 病 痊 再议 。,"But unfortunately Qin Zhong 's always sickly constitution had been much neglected during their two-day excursion into the country , and the unwonted exposure to wind and cold and immoderate indulgence in secret frolic with Sapientia had resulted on his return in a cough and chill accompanied by total loss of appetite . Altogether he presented so sorry a spectacle that study was quite out of the question and they were obliged to send him back home to bed . Although Bao-yu was very disappointed , there was nothing at all he could do but wait for his friend to get better ."
那凤姐 却 已 得 了 云光 的 回信 ， 俱 已 妥协 ， 老 尼达 知 张家 ， 那 守备 无奈何 ， 忍气吞声 受 了 前聘 之 物 。,"Xi-feng had now received Yun Guang is reply to the bogus letter , expressing his readiness to comply with her ( or , as he supposed , Jia Lian 's ) request . Euergesia communicated this information to the Zhangs ; and soon the captain , swallowing his anger and resentment as best he could , was obliged to receive back the betrothal gifts he had sent them on behalf of his son ."
谁知 爱势 贪财 的 父母 ， 却 养 了 一个 知义多情 的 女儿 ， 闻 得 退 了 前夫 ， 另许 李门 ， 他 便 一条 汗巾 悄悄的 寻 了 自尽 。,"But Jin-ge possessed a far nobler spirit than might have been expected in the daughter of such mercenary parents . On learning that her affianced had been sent packing , she quietly went of and hanged herself in her scarf ."
那 守备 之 子 谁知 也 是 个 情种 ， 闻知 金哥 自缢 ， 遂 投河 而 死 。,"The captain 's son , too , turned out to be a young person of unexpectedly romantic notions , for on hearing that Jin-ge had hanged herself , he promptly threw himself into a river and was drowned ."
可怜 张李 二家 没趣 ， 真是 “ 人财两空 ” 。,The Zhangs and the Lis were thus left in a very unenviable situation : ' the maid and eke the money gone ' in the words of the poet .
这里 凤姐 却 安享 了 三千两 。,"The only gainer was Xi-feng , who now had three thousand taels of silver to sit back and enjoy at her leisure ."
王夫人 连 一点 消息 也 不知 。,Not an inkling of this affair reached the ears of Lady Wang .
自此 凤姐 胆识 愈壮 ， 以后 所作所为 ， 诸如此类 ， 不可胜数 。,"Emboldened by this taste of success , Xi-feng from now on undertook many more ventures of a similar nature - far more than we could give an account of in this history ."
一日 正是 贾政 的 生辰 ， 宁荣二 处 人丁 都 齐集 庆贺 ， 热闹 非常 ， 忽 有 门吏 报道 ：,"The day of Jia Zheng 's birthday arrived and all the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households were gathered together to celebrate it . Just as the festivities were at their height , one of the janitors from the main gate burst in on the assembled company :"
“ 有 六 宫都太监 夏 老爷 特 来 降旨 。 ”,' The Master of the imperial Bedchamber Mr Xia is on his way sin with an announcement from His Majesty the Emperor ! '
吓 的 贾赦 贾政 一干 人不知 何事 ， 忙止 了 戏文 ， 撤 去 酒席 ， 摆 香案 ， 启 中门 跪接 。,"Jia She , Jia Zheng and the rest were taken completely by surprise , quite unable to guess what the meaning of this visitation could be . Hurriedly giving orders for the players to halt their performance and for all traces of the feast to be cleared away , they caused a table with burning incense ( which would be required for the reading of the Proclamation , if there was one ) to be set down in its place . Then , throwing open the centre of the three main gates , they knelt down in the entrance of the mansion to receive their visitor ."
早 见 都 太监 夏秉忠 乘马 而至 ， 又 有 许多 跟从 的 内监 。,"Soon Xia Bing-zhong , the Eunuch Master of the Bedchamber , arrived on horseback with a retinue of eunuchs at his back ."
那 夏 太监 也 不曾 负诏 捧 敕 ， 直至 正厅 下马 ， 满面笑容 ， 走 至 厅 上 ， 南面 而立 ， 口内 说 ：,"He appeared to have no Imperial Proclamation or other document on his person , for instead of dismounting , as etiquette prescribed that he should if he was carrying a Written Instrument , he rode straight on to the foot of the main hall . There , with beaming countenance , he got down from his horse , climbed the steps , faced south and gave utterance to the following announcement :"
“ 奉特 旨 ： 立刻 宣贾政 入 朝 ， 在 临敬 殿 陛见 。 ”,' By order of His Imperial Majesty : Jia Zheng is commanded to present himself at court immediately for private audience with His Imperial Majesty in the Hall of Reverence .
说 毕 ， 也 不吃 茶 ， 便 乘马 去 了 。,Having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for so much as a cup of tea and rode away .
贾政 等 也 猜 不出 是 何来 头 ， 只得 即忙 更衣 入 朝 。 贾母 等 合家 人心 俱 惶惶 不定 ， 不住 的 使人 飞马 来往 探信 。,"Still no wiser , Jia Zheng hurried into his court dress and hastened to the Palace , leaving Grandmother Jia and the rest in an extreme state of alarm which they endeavoured ( unsuccessfully ) to allay by dispatching a regular stream of mounted couriers post-haste to the Palace to inquire for news ."
有 两个 时辰 ， 忽 见 赖 大 等 三四个 管家 喘吁吁 跑 进 仪门 报喜 ， 又 说 ： “ 奉 老爷 的 命 ： 就 请 老太太 率领 太太 等 进宫 谢恩 呢 。 ”,"About four hours later Lai Da , the Chief Steward of the Rong-guo mansion , and three or four other stewards came panting into the inner gate and gasped out congratulations . ' Master 's orders , ' said Lai Da between breaths : ' will Her Old Ladyship please bring Their Ladyships to the Palace to give thanks to His Majesty for the great favour he has shown us ! '"
那时 贾母 心神不定 ， 在 大堂 廊 下 伫候 ， 邢王二 夫人 、 尤氏 、 李 纨 、 凤姐 、 迎春 妹妹 以及 薛姨妈 等 ， 皆 聚 在 一处 打听 信息 。,"Unable in her agitated state to remain indoors , Grandmother Jia had been waiting outside in the loggia , whither the others - Lady Xing , Lady Wang , You-shi , Li Wan , Xi-feng , Aunt Xue and the girls - had also congregated to await news of Jia Zheng ."
贾母 又 唤 进赖 大来 细问 端底 ， 赖 大 禀道 ： “ 奴才 们 只 在外 朝房 伺候 着 ， 里头 的 信息 一概不知 。,"Grandmother Jia called Lai Da inside to explain his cryptic message in somewhat greater detail . ' We servants were all waiting in an anteroom , ' Lai Da told her , ' and we had no idea what was going on inside ."
后来 夏 太监 出来 道喜 ， 说 咱们 家 的 大 姑奶奶 封 为 凤藻宫 尚书 ， 加封 贤德 妃 。,Eventually Mr Xia came out and saw us waiting there . ' Congratulations ! ' he said . ' Your eldest young lady has been appointed Chief Secretary to the Empress and is to become an Imperial Concubine . '
后来 老爷 出来 也 这么 吩咐 。,"Then after that Master came out , too , and told us the same thing ."
如今 老爷 又 往 东宫 里 去 了 。,"' I have to go off to the East Palace now , ' he said , ' to see the Prince ."
急速 请 太太 们 去 谢恩 。 ”,But you must hasten back as quick as you can and tell Their Ladyships to come to the Palace and give thanks . '
贾母 等 听 了 方 放下 心来 ， 一时 皆 喜 见于 面 。,"Lai 's information at once dispelled the anxiety that Grandmother Jia and the others had all this time been feeling , and the worried looks on their faces quickly gave way to smiles of pleasure ."
于是 都 按 品大妆 起来 。,Now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed herself in the costume appropriate to her rank .
贾母 率领 邢王二 夫人 并 尤氏 ， 一共 四乘 大 轿 ， 鱼贯 入 朝 。,"Then off they went to the Palace in four sedans one behind the other : Grandmother Jia is at the head , then Lady Xing 's , then Lady Wang 's , and then You-shi 's ."
贾赦 贾珍 亦 换 了 朝服 ， 带领 贾蔷贾蓉 ， 奉 侍贾母 前往 。,"Jia She and Cousin Zhen also changed into court dress , and taking Jia Rong and Jia Qiang with them , accompanied Grandmother Jia to the Palace as her male escort ."
宁荣 两处 上下 内外 人 等 ， 莫不 欢天喜地 ， 独有 宝玉 置若罔闻 。,"There was one person who did not share the unbounded delight now general among the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households - who behaved , indeed , almost as if he had not heard the news at all . This person was Bao-yu ."
你 道 什么 缘故 ？,What was the reason for his unsociable lack of enthusiasm on this occasion ?
原来 近日 水月庵 的 智能 私逃 入城 来 找 秦钟 ， 不意 被 秦邦业 知觉 ， 将 智能 逐出 ， 将 秦钟 打 了 一顿 ， 自己 气 的 老病 发 了 ， 三五日 ， 便 呜呼哀哉 了 。,"A short time previously the little nun Sapientia had absconded from Water-moon Priory and made her way into the city to look for Qin Zhong . Qin Bang-ye had discovered her , driven her from the house , and given Qin Zhong a beating . The shock and anger of the discovery had brought on an attack of the illness from which the old gentleman was a chronic sufferer , and within only four or five days he had breathed his last ."
秦钟本 自 怯弱 ， 又 带病 未 痊 ， 受 了 笞杖 ， 今 见 老父 气死 ， 悔痛无及 ， 又 添 了 许多 病症 。,Qin Zhong had always been of a weak and nervous disposition and had still not fully recovered from his sickness when these events occurred . The severe beating followed by the overwhelming grief and remorse attendant on the death of his father from anger which he had himself provoked led to serious complications in his illness .
因此 ， 宝玉 心中 怅怅 不 乐 。 虽 有 元春 晋封 之 事 ， 那 解得 他 的 愁闷 ？,"This , then , was the reason for Bao-yu 's unseasonable melancholy - a melancholy which the news of his sister Yuan-chun 's dazzling promotion was powerless to dispel ."
贾母 等 如何 谢恩 ， 如何 回家 ， 亲友 如何 来 庆贺 ， 宁荣 两府 近日 如何 热闹 ， 众人 如何 得意 ， 独 他 一个 皆 视 有如 无 ， 毫不介意 ：,"Grandmother Jia 's visit to the Palace to give thanks , her return home , the visits of friends and relations to congratulate the family , the unwontedly cheerful bustle of the Ning and Rong households during the days that followed , the general satisfaction that everyone in those households now seemed to feel - as far as Bao-yu was concerned these things might just as well not have been : he viewed them with the eyes of an outsider ."
因此 众人 嘲 他 越发 呆 了 。,"The rest of the family merely laughed at him , seeing in this behaviour only further confirmation of their belief that he was ' a bit touched ' ."
且 喜 贾琏 与 黛玉 回来 ， 先遣 人 来 报信 ， 明日 就 可到 家 了 ， 宝玉 听 了 ， 方略 有些 喜意 。,But then there was Jia Lian 's and Dai-yu 's homecoming to look forward to . The advent of the messenger sent on ahead to announce that they would be arriving next day produced the first glimmer of cheerfulness that Bao-yu had so far shown .
细问 原由 ， 方知 贾雨村 也 进京 引见 ， — — 皆 由 王子腾 累 上荐 本 ， 此来 候补 京 缺 ， — — 与 贾琏 是 同宗 弟兄 ， 又 与 黛玉 有 师徒 之谊 ， 故 同路 作伴 而 来 。,"On being questioned for further details the messenger told them that Jia Yu-cun was also returning to the capital to have an audience with the Emperor . This was the doing of Wang Zi-teng , who had recommended him in a report to the throne for promotion to a metropolitan post . As he was both a cousin ( albeit a remote one ) of Jia Lian and also Dai-yu 's former teacher , it had been resolved that he should travel with them ."
林如海 已 葬入 祖茔 了 ， 诸事 停妥 。 贾琏 这 番 进京 ， 若 按 站 走时 ， 本该 出 月 到 家 ， 因 听见 元春 喜信 ， 遂 昼夜兼程 而 进 ， 一路 俱 各 平安 。,"Lin Ru-hai having been laid with his ancestors in the family burying-ground and his obsequies duly concluded , they would , if they had proceeded to the capital by the usual stages , have been arriving back some time in the following month ; but when Jia Lian heard the news about Yuan-chun 's elevation , they had decided to make greater speed , travelling by night as well as by day . The journey had been smooth and uneventful ."
宝玉 只 问 了 黛玉 好 ， 余者 也 就 不在意 了 。,"Bao-yu merely asked if Dai-yu was all right , and on being assured that she was , paid no further attention to the man 's news ."
好容易 盼 到 明日 午 错 ， 果报 ： “ 琏 二爷 和 林姑娘 进府 了 。 ”,"Having waited with great impatience until the early afternoon of the following day , Bao-yu and the rest were rewarded with the announcement ' Mr Lian and Miss Lin have just arrived ! '"
见面 时 彼此 悲喜交集 ， 未免 大哭 一场 ， 又 致 庆 慰 之 词 。 宝玉 细看 那黛玉 时 ， 越发 出落 的 超逸 了 。,"The joy of their reunion was , however , tempered with grief , because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting , and for a while there was much loud weeping on either side . Then there were words of comfort and congratulation to exchange and Bao-yu had an opportunity of studying Dai-yu more carefully . He recognized the same ethereal quality he had always known in her , but it seemed to have deepened and intensified during her absence ."
黛玉 又 带 了 许多 书籍 来 ， 忙 着 打扫 卧室 ， 安排 器具 ， 又 将 些 纸笔 等物 分送 与 宝钗 、 迎春 、 宝玉 等 。,"She had brought a lot of books back with her and was soon busy superintending the sweeping out of her bedroom to accommodate them and arranging various objets d ' art around it which had also formed part of her luggage . She had salvaged some paper , writing-brushes and other articles of stationery from her old home which she distributed as presents to Bao-chai , Ying-chun , Bao-yu and the rest ."
宝玉 又 将 北静王 所 赠 蕶 苓 香串 珍重 取出 来 ， 转送 黛玉 。 黛玉 说 ： “ 什么 臭男人 拿 过 的 ， 我 不要 这 东西 。 ” 遂 掷 还 不取 。,"Bao-yu for his part hunted up the rosary of fragrant Indian beads given him by the Prince of Bei-jing and offered it as a gift to Dai-yu ; but she flung it back at him disdainfully : ' What , carry a thing that some coarse man has pawed over ? I do not want it ! '"
宝玉 只得 收回 ， 暂且 无 话 。,So Bao-yu was compelled to take it back again .
且说 贾琏自 回家 见 过 众人 ， 回至 房中 ， 正值 凤姐 事 繁 ， 无 片刻 闲空 ， 见 贾琏 远路 归来 ， 少不得 拨冗 接待 。,"But let us now turn to Jia Lian . When he had finished seeing everyone in the family , Jia Lian returned at last to his own apartment . Xi-feng , though still so busy that she had not a moment 's leisure , had somehow contrived to find time to welcome back her wandering lord ."
因 房内 别 无 外人 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 国舅 老爷 大喜 ！,"' Congratulations , Imperial Kinsman ! ' she said with a smile when , except for the servants , they were at last alone together ."
国舅 老爷 一路风尘 辛苦 ！,"' You have had a tiring journey , Imperial Kinsman ."
小 的 听见 昨日 的 头起 报马 来说 ， 今日 大 驾归府 ， 略 预备 了 一杯 水酒 掸 尘 ， 不知 可赐 光谬 领否 ？ ”,"Yesterday when the courier gave notice of your arrival , I prepared a humble entertainment to celebrate your homecoming . Will the Imperial Kinsman graciously condescend to take a cup of wine with his handmaid ? '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 岂敢 ， 岂敢 ！,"Jia Lian replied in the same vein : ' Madam , you are too kind !"
多 承 ， 多 承 ！ ”,"I am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant , madam ! '"
一面 平儿 与 众 丫鬟 参见 毕 ， 端 上 茶 来 。,"As they joked together , Patience and the other maids came forward to welcome their Master back , after which they served them both with tea ."
贾琏遂 问别 后 家中 诸事 ， 又 谢凤姐 的 辛苦 。,Jia Lian asked Xi-feng about the events that had occurred during his absence and thanked her for looking after things so well while he was away .
凤姐 道 ： “ 我 那里 管 的 上 这些 事来 ！,"' I am not much of a manager really , ' said Xi-feng ."
见识 又 浅 ， 嘴 又 笨 ， 心 又 直 ， ‘ 人家 给 个 棒槌 ， 我 就 拿 着 认作 针 ’ 了 。,"' I haven ' t got the knowledge , and I am too poor at expressing myself and too simple-minded - always inclined to "" take a ramrod for a needle "" , as they say ."
脸 又 软 ， 搁不住 人家 给 两句 好 话儿 。,"Besides , I am too soft-hearted for the job . Anyone who says a few kind words can get the better of me ."
况且 又 没 经过 事 ， 胆子 又 小 ， 太太 略 有点 不 舒服 ， 就 吓 的 也 睡不着 了 。,And my lack of experience makes me so nervous . Aunt Wang only had to be the slightest bit displeased and I would get so upset that I could not sleep at night .
我 苦辞 过 几回 ， 太太 不许 ， 倒 说 我 图 受用 ， 不肯 学习 。,"I begged her not to make me do all these things , but she insisted . She said I only refused out of laziness and unwillingness to learn ."
那里 知道 我 是 捻 着 把 汗 儿 呢 ！ 一句 也 不敢 多 说 ， 一步 也 不敢 妄行 。,I do not think she realizes even now the state I have been in - too scared to move or even to open my mouth for fear of saying or doing something wrong .
你 是 知道 的 ， 咱们 家 所有 的 这些 管家 奶奶 ， 那 一个 是 好缠 的 ？,And you know what a difficult lot those old stewardesses are .
错 一点儿 他们 就 笑话 打趣 ， 偏 一点儿 他们 就 ‘ 指桑骂槐 ’ 的 抱怨 ；,The tiniest mistake and they are all laughing at you and making fun ; the tiniest hint of favouritism and they are grumbling and complaining .
‘ 坐 山 看 虎 斗 ’ ， ‘ 借刀杀人 ’ ， ‘ 引风吹火 ’ ， ‘ 站 干岸儿 ’ ， ‘ 推倒 了 油瓶 儿 不 扶 ’ ， 都 是 全 挂子 的 本事 ；,"You know their way of "" cursing the oak-tree when they mean the ash "" . Those old women know just how to sit on the mountain-top and watch the tigers fight ; how to murder with a borrowed knife , or help the wind to fan the fire . They will look on safely from the bank while you are drowning in the river . And the fallen oil bottle can drain away : they are not going to pick it up ."
况且 我 又 年轻 ， 不 压 人 ， 怨不得 不 把 我 搁 在 眼里 。,"On top of that , as I am so young , I haven ' t got much authority over them ; so it was all I could do to prevent them from ignoring me altogether ."
更 可笑 那府里蓉 儿媳妇 死 了 ， 珍 大哥 再三 在 太太 跟前 跪 着 讨情 ， 只要 请 我 帮 他 几天 ；,"And to crown it all , when Rong 's wife died Cousin Zhen kept coming round to see Aunt Wang and begging her on his knees to let me help out for a day or two next door ."
我 再 四 推辞 ， 太太 做情 应 了 ， 只得 从命 ， — — 到底 叫 我 闹 了 个 马仰人翻 ， 更 不成 个 体统 。,"I said again and again that I could not do it ; but Aunt Wang agreed just to please him , so there was nothing for it but to do as I was told . I am afraid I made a terrible mess of it - even worse than I did here ."
至今 珍 大哥 还 抱怨 后悔 呢 。,And now it seems Cousin Zhen is beginning to grumble and says he wishes he had never asked me .
你 明儿 见 了 他 ， 好歹 赔释 赔释 ， 就 说 我 年轻 ， 原 没 见过世面 ， 谁 叫 大爷 错委 了 他 呢 。 ”,"When you see him tomorrow , do please try to make it up with him . Tell him it is because I am young and inexperienced . You might even hint that it is his own fault for having asked me in the first place ! '"
说 着 ， 只 听 外间 有人 说话 ， 凤姐 便 问 ： “ 是 谁 ？ ”,While she was saying this there was a sound of talking in the next room . ' Who is it ? ' said Xi-feng .
平儿 进来 回 道 ： “ 姨太太 打发 香菱 妹子 来 问 我 一句 话 ， 我 已经 说 了 ， 打发 他 回去 了 。 ”,Patience came in to reply . ' Mrs Xue sent Caltrop over to ask me about something . I have already given her an answer and sent her back . '
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 正是 呢 。,"' Ah yes ! ' said Jia Lian , apparently pleased by the recollection ."
我 才 见 姨妈 去 ， 和 一个 年轻 的 小媳妇 子刚 走 了 个 对 脸儿 ， 长 得 好 齐整 模样儿 。,"' When I went to call on Aunt Xue just now to tell her I was back , I ran into such a pretty young woman !"
我 想 咱们 家 没 这个 人 哪 ， 说话 时 问 姨妈 ， 才 知道 是 打官司 的 那 小丫头 子 ， 叫 什么 ‘ 香菱 ’ 的 ， 竟 给 薛大 傻子 作 了 屋里人 ， 开 了 脸 ， 越 发出 挑 的 标致 了 。,"I could not place her as any of the girls in our household , so in the course of conversation I asked Aunt Xue who she was . It seems that she is the little maid they had that lawsuit about . Cal - something . Caltrop . She is finally been given as "" chamber-wife "" to that idiot Xue . Now that she has been plucked and painted like a grown-up woman she really does look most attractive !"
— — 那 薛大 傻子 真 玷辱 了 他 ！ ”,What a waste to throw away a beautiful girl on that great booby ! '
凤姐 把 嘴 一撇 ， 道 ： “ 哎 ！,Xi-feng made a little moue .
往 苏杭 走 了 一趟 回来 ， 也 该 见 点 世面 了 ， 还是 这么 眼馋肚饱 的 。,"' I should have thought that having just got back from Hangchow and Soochow and seen something of the world , you would have settled down a bit ; but I see you are still the same greedy-guts as ever ."
你 要 爱 他 ， 不值 什么 ， 我 拿 平儿 换 了 他 来 好不好 ？,"Well , if you want her , there is nothing simpler : I will exchange our Patience for her ."
那 薛 老大 也 是 ‘ 吃 着 碗 里 瞧 着 锅 里 ’ 的 ， 这 一年 来 的 时候 ， 他 为 香菱 儿 不能 到手 ， 和 姑妈 打 了 多少 饥荒 。,"You know what Cousin Xue is like : always "" one eye on the dish and the other on the saucepan "" . Throughout the whole of this last year there have been I do not know how many alarms and excursions between him and poor Aunt Xue because she would not let him get his hands on Caltrop ."
姑妈 看着 香菱 的 模样儿 好 还是 小事 ， 因 他 做人 行事 ， 又 比 别的 女孩子 不同 ， 温柔 安静 ， 差不多 儿 的 主子 姑娘 还 跟不上 他 ， 才 摆酒 请客 的 费事 ， 明堂正道 给 他 做 了 屋里人 。,"It was not just her looks that made her concerned for the girl . Everything about her is so unusual . She is so gentle and so quiet . Even among our own young ladies there is scarcely her equal . In the end Aunt Xue decided that if she could not stop him having her , at least she could make sure that the thing was done properly , with a party and invitations and all the rest of it . So that is what she did , and made her his chamber wife ."
过 了 没 半月 ， 也 没事人 一大堆 了 。 ”,"But would you believe it , before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost interest ... '"
一 语 未了 ， 二门 上 的 小厮 传报 ： “ 老爷 在 大 书房 里 等 着 二爷 呢 。 ”,"She was interrupted by an announcement from one of the pages on the inner gate : ' Mr Zhen wants you , sir . He is waiting for you in the larger study . '"
贾琏 听 了 ， 忙忙 整衣 出去 。,At once Jia Lian did up his gown and hurried out .
这里 凤姐 因 问 平儿 ： “ 方才 姑妈 有 什么 事 ， 巴巴儿 的 打发 香菱 来 ？ ”,"' What on earth did Mrs Xue want , sending Caltrop here like that ? ' Xi-feng asked Patience as soon as he had gone ."
平儿 道 ： “ 那里 来 的 香菱 ！,' It was not Caltrop ! ' said Patience .
是 我 借 他 暂 撒 个 谎儿 。,I had to make something up and hers was the first name that came to mind .
奶奶 瞧 ， 旺儿 嫂子 越发 连 个 算计 儿 也 没了 ！ ”,That wife of Brightie 's is such a stupid woman ! Just imagine '
说 着 ， 又 走 至 凤姐 身边 ， 悄悄 说道 ： “ 那项 利银 早不 送来 ， 晚 不 送来 ， 这 会子 二爷 在家 ， 他 偏 送 这个 来 了 ！,"- she drew closer to Xi-feng 's ear and lowered her voice - ' of all the times she could have chosen to bring you the interest on that money , she had to pick on the very moment when the Master has just got home !"
幸亏 我 在 堂屋 里 磞 见 了 ， 不然 他 走 了 来回 奶奶 ， 叫 二爷 要是 知道 了 ， 咱们 二爷 那 脾气 ， 油锅 里 的 还要 捞 出来 花呢 ， 知道 奶奶 有 了 体己 ， 他 还 不大 着 胆子 花么 ？,"It is lucky I was in the outside room when she came , otherwise she might have come blundering in here and Master would have heard her message . And we all know what Master is like where money is concerned : he would spend the fat in the frying-pan if he could get it out ! Once he found out that you had savings , he would pluck up courage to spend them in no time ."
所以 我 赶着 接过 来 ， 叫 我 说 了 他 两句 ， 谁知 奶奶 偏 听见 了 。,"Anyway , I took the money from her quickly and gave her a piece of my mind - which I am afraid you must have heard ."
— — 为什么 当着 二爷 我 才 只 说 是 香菱 来 了 呢 ！ ”,That is why I had to say what I did . I would never have mentioned Caltrop in the Master 's presence otherwise !
凤姐 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 我 说 呢 ， 姑妈 知道 你 二爷 来 了 ， 忽 剌 巴儿 的 打发 个 屋里人 来 ！,"Xi-feng laughed . ' I was going to say ! Why , for no apparent reason , should Mrs Xue choose a chamber-wife to send here the moment Master gets back ?"
原来 是 你 这 蹄子 闹鬼 ！ ”,"So it was you up to your tricks , you little monkey ! '"
说 着 贾琏 已 进来 了 ， 凤姐命 摆 上 酒 馔 来 ， 夫妻 对 坐 。,At this point Jia Lian came in again and Xi-feng ordered her maids to serve the wine and various choice dishes to go with it . Husband and wife sat cross-legged at opposite sides of the low table on the kang and began their drinking -
凤姐 虽 善 饮 ， 却 不敢 任兴 。,"Xi-feng with some restraint , although she was normally a fairly hard drinker , in view of the occasion ."
正 喝 着 ， 见 贾琏 的 乳母 赵嬷嬷 走来 。,"They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian 's old wet-nurse , Nannie Zhao , walked in ."
贾琏 、 凤姐 忙 让 吃酒 ， 叫 他 上 炕去 。,The young couple at once invited her to drink with them and tried to make her join them on the kang .
赵嬷嬷 执意 不肯 。,
平儿 等 早于 炕沿 设下 一几 ， 摆 一 脚踏 ， 赵嬷嬷 在 脚踏 上 坐 了 ， 贾琏 向 桌上 拣 两盘 肴馔 与 他 ， 放在 几上 自吃 。,"This last honour she would under no circumstances accept , and Patience and the girls laid a little table for her at the side of the kang and set a little stool beside it , on which she sat down very contentedly . Jia Lian made a selection with his chopsticks from the dishes on the table , and after heaping up two platefuls , set them down on Nannie Zhao 's own little table for her to eat there by herself ."
凤姐 又 道 ： “ 妈妈 很 嚼 不动 那个 ， 没 的 倒 硌 了 他 的 牙 。 ”,Xi-feng was critical : ' Nannie can not chew stuff like that . She will break her teeth on it ! '
因 问 平儿 道 ： “ 早起 我 说 那 一碗 火腿 燉 肘子 很烂 ， 正好 给 妈妈 吃 ， 你 怎么 不 拿 了 去 赶着 叫 他们 热 来 ？ ” 又 道 ： “ 妈妈 ， 你 尝一尝 你 儿子 带来 的 惠泉酒 。 ”,"She turned to Patience . ' That piece of boiled gammon in the bowl I said this morning was so tender : that would be Just the thing for Nannie . Why do not you run round to the kitchen and ask them to heat it up for her ? - Nannie , ' she said , addressing the old woman , ' you must try some of the rice wine your Lian brought back with him from the South !"
赵嬷嬷 道 ： “ 我 喝 呢 ！,"' Ooh yes ! said Nannie Zhao , ' I must try some of that !"
奶奶 也 喝 一钟 。,"And you must have some too , Mrs Lian ."
怕 什么 ？,Never fear !
只 不要 过 多 了 就是 了 。,"As long as you do not drink too much , ' twill do you good ."
我 这 会子 跑 了 来 ， 倒也不 为 酒饭 ， 倒有 一件 正经事 ， 奶奶 好歹 记 在 心里 ， 疼顾 我些 罢 ！,"But I did not come all the way here for vittles and drink , bless you . I came on more serious business . And you heed my words , Mrs Lian , and stick up for me ;"
我们 这 爷 ， 只是 嘴里 说 的 好 ， 到 了 跟前 就 忘 了 我们 。,"because that Master Lian of yours he always says he will do something , but when you go to see him later , he is clean forgot all about it !"
幸亏 我 从小儿 奶 了 你 这么 大 。,"To think I reared you up on the milk of my own bosom , Master Lian ! And a fine young man you have growed into , thanks be !"
我 也 老 了 ， 有的是 那 两个 儿子 ， 你 就 另 眼 照看 他们 些 ， 别人 也 不敢 呲 牙儿 的 。,"Well , I am old and of no account now . But there are these two sons of mine , d ' ye see ? If only you would be more like a foster-brother to them and look after them a bit , no one would dare say a word agen them ."
我 还 再三 的 求 了 你 几遍 ， 你 答应 的 倒好 ， 如今 还是 落空 。,"But dearie me ! I have asked you again and again to help them , and you always says yes ; yet to this very day nothing has ever come of it ."
这 如今 又 从 天上 跑 出 这样 一件 大喜事 来 ， 那里 用不着 人 ？,"Well , what I thought was this , Mrs Lian . With this great blessing of Heaven that is come on the family on account of your eldest young lady , surely , I thought to myself , there must be jobs in this for someone ?"
所以 倒 是 来 和 奶奶 说 是 正经 。 靠着 我们 爷 ， 只怕 我 还 饿死 了 呢 ！ ”,"I will talk to Mrs Lian about it , I said to myself ; because if I rely on Master Lian to help us , we will starve to death for certain sure ! '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 妈妈 ， 你 的 两个 奶 哥哥 都 交给 我 。,"Xi-feng laughed . ' Leave your two boys to me , Nannie . I will look after them !"
你 从小儿 奶 的 儿子 还有 什么 不知 他 那 脾气 的 ？ 拿 着 皮肉 倒 往 那 不相干 的 外人 身上 贴 。 可是 现 放 着 奶 哥哥 那 一个 不 比人强 ？,"You know all about Lian is little ways because you nursed him when he was a baby : he will give the dearest thing he has to some nobody he is picked up outside , yet his own two foster-brothers who are much nicer young men than any of his favourites he neglects completely ."
你 疼 顾 照看 他们 ， 谁 敢 说 个 ‘ 不 ’ 字儿 ？ 没的白 便宜 了 外人 。,"If only you would take a bit of interest in e Lian , you would not hear a word of complaint from anyone , instead of wasting your kindnesses on those - those little male misses of yours !"
— — 我 这话 也 说错 了 ： 我们 看着 是 ‘ 外人 ’ ， 你 却 看着 是 ‘ 内 人 ’ 一样 呢 ！ ”,"I should not have called them "" misses "" , though . You treat the misses as your missus and give me the miss !"
说 着 ， 满 屋里人 都 笑 了 。,"There was a loud laugh from everyone present , including Nannie Zhao , who concluded her cackles with a pious invocation :"
赵嬷嬷 也 笑 个 不住 ， 又 念佛 道 ： “ 可是 屋子里 跑 出 青天 来 了 。,' Bless his Holy Name ! Here at last comes a just judge to set all things to rights -
要说 ‘ 内 人 ’ ‘ 外人 ’ 这些 混账 事 ， 我们 爷 是 没有 的 ； 不过 是 脸软心慈 ， 搁不住 人求 两句 罢了 。 ”,"But oh Mrs Lian , those naughty things you said about "" misses "" : that is not my Master Lian . It is Just that he is so soft-hearted he can not bring himself to say "" no "" to anyone who spins him a tale ."
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 可不是 呢 。 有 ‘ 内 人 ’ 的 他 才 慈软 呢 ！ 他 在 咱们 娘儿们 跟前 才 是 刚硬 呢 ！ ”,"' Soft-hearted with his boy friends , maybe , ' said Xi-feng with a lubricious smile ; ' but when he has to do with us women he is hard enough . '"
赵嬷嬷 道 ： “ 奶奶 说 的 太 尽情 了 ， 我 也 乐 了 ， 再 喝 一钟 好 酒 。,"' Tee , hee , hee , what a one you are , Mrs Lian ! I do not know when I was last so merry . Come on , let is have another cup of that good wine ! -"
从此 我们 奶奶 做 了 主 ， 我 就 没 的 愁 了 。 ”,Now that I have got Mrs Lian to stand up for me I shall have no more worries ! '
贾琏 此时 不好意思 ， 只是 讪笑 道 ： “ 你们 别胡说 了 ， 快 盛饭 来 吃 ， 还要 到 珍 大爷 那边 去 商量 事 呢 。 ”,Jia Lian was by now thoroughly embarrassed and laughed sheepishly . ' Stop all this nonsense now and serve the rice ! I have still got to go round to Cousin Zhen 's after this to discuss things . '
凤姐 道 ： “ 可是 ， 别 误 了 正事 。,"' Ah yes , ' said Xi-feng . ' We must not make you late for that ."
才刚 老爷 叫 你 说 什么 ？ ”,What did Cousin Zhen want you for just now ? '
贾琏 道 ： “ 就 为 省亲 的 事 。 ”,"' It was about the visitation business , ' said Jia Lian ."
凤姐 忙 问道 ： “ 省亲 的 事 竟准 了 ？ ”,"' Has it been settled , then ? '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 虽 不 十分 准 ， 也 有 八九分 了 。 ”,"' Well , not absolutely . Eight or nine parts settled , you might say . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 可是 当今 的 恩典 呢 ！,"' That is a great favour of the Emperor 's , is not it ? ' said Xi-feng ."
从来 听 书 听戏 ， 古时候 儿 也 没有 的 。 ”,' Something you do not hear of even in plays and stories about the olden days . '
赵嬷嬷 又 接口 道 ： “ 可是 呢 。,' Very true ! ' chimed in Nannie Zhao .
我 也 老糊涂 了 ！ 我 听见 上上下下 吵嚷 了 这些 日子 ， 什么 省亲 不 省亲 ， 我 也 不 理论 ；,"' But I must be getting old and stupid , for everywhere these last few days have been abuzz with talk of "" visitations "" , but blessed if I can make head or tail of it ."
如今 又 说 省亲 ， 到底 是 怎么 个 缘故 呢 ？ ”,"You tell us now : just what manner of thing s this "" visitation "" ? '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 如今 当今 体贴 万 人 之 心 ， 世上 至 大 莫如 ‘ 孝 ’ 字 ， 想来 父母 儿女 之 性 ， 皆 是 一理 ， 不在 贵贱 上分 的 。,"Jia Lian undertook to do so . ' Our present Emperor , who has always had a great sympathy for the common man , believes that the filial affection of a child for its parents is the most important thing in the world , and that family feeling is the same everywhere , irrespective of social rank ."
当今 自 为 日夜 侍奉 太上皇 、 皇太后 ， 尚 不能 略 尽孝 意 ， 因见 宫里 嫔妃 才 人 等 皆 是 入 宫 多年 ， 抛离 父母 ， 岂 有 不 思想 之 理 ？,"He has found that in his own case , even after seeing the Ex-Emperor and Ex-Empress morning , noon and night every day of his life , he is still unable to express more than a fraction of the devotion he feels for them ; and this has led him to think of all those concubines and maids of honour and other court ladies , taken from their homes and shut up in the Palace for years and years on end , and to realize how much they must miss their parents ."
且 父母 在家 ， 思想 女儿 ， 不能 一 见 ， 倘 因此 成疾 ， 亦 大 伤 天 和 之事 。,"And from there he got to thinking of the parents themselves , how they must long for the daughters they can never see again . And then he thought what a crime against Nature it would be if any of those parents were to become ill as a result of not seeing their daughters ."
所以 启奏 太上皇 、 皇太后 ， 每月 逢 二六 日期 ， 准椒 房 眷属 入 宫请候 。,And so he addressed a Memorial to the Ex-Emperor and Ex-Empress requesting permission to allow the families of palace ladies to visit them in the Palace on the twelfth day of every month .
于是 太上皇 、 皇太后 大喜 ， 深赞 当今 至孝 纯 仁 ， 体天格物 ， 因此 二位 老 圣人 又 下 谕旨 说 ： 椒 房 眷属 人宫 ， 未免 有关 国体 仪制 ， 母女 尚未 能 惬怀 。,"When Their Old Majesties saw this Memorial they were very pleased and praised the Emperor for his piety and goodness - "" doing Heaven 's work among men "" they called it . But they pointed out in their Rescript that when the families of court ladies entered the Palace on these visits , they would inevitably be hampered by the restrictions of court etiquette in the expression of their natural feelings ."
竟大 开 方便 之 恩 ， 特降谕 诸椒 房 贵戚 ， 除 二 六日 入 宫之恩 外 ， 凡 有重 宇 别院 之 家 ， 可以 驻辟 关防 者 ， 不妨 启请 内廷 銮舆 人其私 第 ， 庶可 尽 骨肉 私情 ， 共享 天伦之乐 事 。,"So in the end , by an act of supreme generosity , the Emperor issued a special decree in which he said that , apart from allowing the families of court ladies to visit their daughters in the Palace on the twelfth day of each month , he would allow any family which had a separate house or annexe capable of being maintained in the degree of security specified for a Temporary Imperial Residence to make written application for permission to receive a Visitation in their own home , where the pleasures of reunion could be enjoyed in an atmosphere of intimacy and affection ."
此 旨下 了 ， 谁 不 踊跃 感戴 ！,The proclamation of this decree has created quite a stir .
现今 周贵妃 的 父亲 已 在 家里 动 了 工 ， 修盖 省亲 的 别院 呢 。 又 有 吴 贵妃 的 父亲 吴天 祐 家 ， 也 往 城外 踏看 地方 去 了 。,"The Imperial Concubine Lady Zhou s father already has the builders at work on a special wing for visitations in his house , and Lady Wu is father , Wu Tian-you , has been outside the city looking for a site ."
— — 这 岂非 有 八九分 了 ？ ”,"So its already eight or nine parts settled , as I said . '"
赵嬷嬷 道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！,' Bless my soul ! ' said Nannie Zhao .
原来如此 。,' So that is what it is !
这样 说起 ， 咱们 家 也 要 预备 接大 姑奶奶 了 ？ ”,"Well , I suppose in that case we shall soon be getting ready to receive our young lady ? '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 这 何用 说 ？,"' Of course , ' said Jia Lian ."
不么 这 会子 忙 的 是 什么 ？ ”,' What else do you think we are all so busy about ? '
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 果然如此 ， 我 可 也 见 个 大 世面 了 。,"' If we do receive her , ' said Xi-feng , ' it should be an experience worth remembering ."
可恨 我 小 几岁 年纪 ， 若 早 生 二三十年 ， 如今 这些 老人家 也 不薄 我 没 见世面 了 。,I have often wished I would been born twenty or thirty years earlier so that the old folk would not be able to look down on me for having missed so much .
说起 当年 太祖 皇帝 仿 舜 巡 的 故事 ， 比 一部 书 还 热闹 ， 我 偏偏 的 没 赶上 。 ”,To hear them talk about the Emperor Tai-zu 's Southern Progress is better than listening to a story-teller . How I wish I would been there to see it all ! '
赵嬷嬷 道 ： “ 暧哟 ！,"' Ah , now ! ' said Nannie Zhao ."
那 可是 千载难逢 的 ！,' That is the sort of thing that scarce comes once in a thousand years !
那 时候 我 才 记事儿 。,I was not so young then that I can not still remember .
咱们 贾府 正在 姑苏 扬州 一带 监造 海船 ， 修理 海塘 ， 只 预备 接驾 一次 ， 把 银子 花 的 象 淌 海水 似的 ！,"The head of the Jia family in those days was Superintendant of Shipyards and Harbour Maint ' nance in the Soochow-Yangchow area and was chosen to receive the Emperor on one of his visits . The way they spent silver on that visit , why , it was like pouring out salt sea water !"
说 起来 — — ”,I call to mind . . . '
凤姐忙 接道 ： “ 我们 王府 里 也 预备 过 一次 。,"Xi-feng in her eagerness cut her short : ' We Wangs received the Emperor on one of his visits , too ."
那时 我 爷爷 专管 各国 进贡 朝贺 的 事 ， 凡 有 外国人 来 ， 都 是 我们 家 养活 。,"At that time my grandfather was in charge of all the foreign tribute and the embassies going up to Court . Whenever any foreigners arrived , it was always my family that put them up ."
粤 、 闽 、 滇 、 浙 所有 的 洋船 货物 都 是 我们 家 的 。 ”,"All the goods brought by the foreign ships to the seaports in Kwangtung , Fukien , Yunnan and Chekiang passed through our hands . '"
赵嬷嬷 道 ： “ 那 是 谁 不 知道 的 ？,"' Everybody knows that , ' said Nannie Zhao ."
如今 还有 个 俗语 儿 呢 ， 说 ： ‘ 东海 少 了 白玉 床 ， 龙王 来 请 金陵 王 。 ’ 这 说 的 就是 奶奶 府上 了 。,"' There is even a rhyme about it : The King of the Ocean Goes along , When he is short of gold beds , To the Nanking Wang , That is your family : the "" Nanking Wangs "" ."
如今 还有 现在 江南 的 甄家 ， 暧哟 ！,"But then there is the Zhens , who still live down that way in Kiangnan . My word !"
好 势派 ！,There is riches for you !
独 他们 家 接驾 四次 ， 要不是 我们 亲眼看见 ， 告诉 谁 也 不信 的 。,"That family alone received the Emperor four times ! If I had not seen with my own two eyes , I do not care who told me , I would not have credited it , the sights I saw then !"
别 讲 银子 成 了 粪土 ， 凭 是 世上 有 的 ， 没有 不是 堆山积海 的 。,Never mind silver . Silver was just dirt to them . Every precious thing in the world you can think of they had there in mountains !
‘ 罪过 可惜 ’ 四个 字 竟 顾不得 了 ！ ”,"Words like "" save "" and "" spare "" they just did not seem to know the meaning of ! '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 我 常 听见 我们 太爷 说 ， 也 是 这样 的 。,"' I believe you , ' said Xi-feng . ' I have heard my grandfather talk about it , and he said it was just like that ."
岂 有 不信 的 ？ 只 纳罕 他家 怎么 就 这样 富贵 呢 ？ ”,But it still amazes me that a single family could have so much wealth . '
赵嬷嬷 道 ： “ 告诉 奶奶 一句 话 ： 也 不过 拿 着 皇帝 家 的 银子 往 皇帝 身上 使 罢了 ！,"' I will tell you something , Mrs Lian , ' said the knowledgeable Nannie . ' Twere no more than paying for the Emperor 's entertainment with the Emperor 's own silver ."
谁家 有 那些 钱 买 这个 虚 热闹 去 ？ ”,No family that ever lived had money enough of its own to pay for such spectacles of vanity ! '
正说 着 ， 王夫人 又 打发 人 来 瞧 凤姐 吃 完 了 饭 不曾 。,"While they were chatting , Lady Wang sent someone round to see if Xi-feng had finished her dinner yet ."
凤姐 便 知 有事 等 他 ， 赶忙 的 吃了饭 ， 漱口 要 走 ， 又 有 二门 上 小厮 们 回 ： “ 东府里 蓉 蔷 二位 哥儿 来 了 。 ”,"Xi-feng realized that there must be something which demanded her attention and , finishing hurriedly , rinsed out her mouth and prepared to go . Before she could leave , however , the pages from the second gate announced the arrival of Jia Rong and Jia Qiang from the Ning-guo mansion next door ."
贾琏 才 漱 了 口 ， 平儿 捧 着 盆 盥手 ， 见 他 二人 来 了 ， 便 问 ： “ 说 什么 话 ？ ”,Jia Lian had just finished rinsing his mouth and was washing his hands in a basin held out for him by Patience when the two young men came into the room . ' What is your message ? ' he asked them .
凤姐因 亦 止步 ， 只 听 贾蓉先 回说 ： “ 我 父亲 打发 我 来回 叔叔 ： 老爷 们 已经 议定 了 ， 从 东边 一带 ， 接着 东府里 花园 起 ， 至 西北 ， 丈量 了 ， 一共 三里 半 大 ， 可以 盖造 省亲 别院 了 。,"Xi-feng , curious , stayed to hear . ' Father sent us to tell you that the uncles have already reached a decision , ' said Jia Rong . They have measured off an area just over a quarter of a mile square which takes in a part of our grounds , including the All-scents Garden , on the east side , and the northwest corner of your grounds on the west , to be turned into a Separate Residence for the Visitation ."
已经 传人 画 图样 去 了 ， 明日 就 得 。,"They have already commissioned someone to draw a plan , which should be ready tomorrow ."
叔叔 才 回家 ， 未免 劳乏 ， 不用 过 我们 那边 去 ， 有话 明日 一早 再 请 过去 面议 。 ”,"Father says as you have just got home he is sure you must be tired , so do not bother to come round tonight . If there is anything to discuss , you can tell him about it first thing tomorrow . '"
贾琏 笑 说 ： “ 多谢 大爷 费心 ， 体谅 我 ， 就 从命 不 过去 了 。,"' Thank your father for me very much , said Jia Lian with a grateful smile . ' It is very good of him to let me of tonight , and I shall do as he says and not go over until tomorrow ."
正经 是 这个 主意 ， 才 省事 ， 盖造 也 容易 ； 若 采置 别的 地方 去 ， 那 更 费事 ， 且 不成体统 。,"I think the great advantage of this proposal is that it is so economical and makes the job of construction so much easier . It would mean very much more trouble if we were to build on land outside , yet at the same time we should lose the convenience this present scheme gives us of a single layout ."
你 回去 说 ： 这样 很 好 ， 若 老爷 们 再 要 改 时 ， 全仗 大爷 谏阻 ， 万 不可 另寻 地方 。,"Tell him when you get back that I think it is an excellent proposal , and that I leave it to him to protest in any way he thinks fit if the others show signs of going back on it . The one thing we must under no circumstances do is to go looking for land outside ."
明日 一早 ， 我 给 大爷 请安 去 ， 再 细 商量 。 ”,"Anyway , I shall be round to see him first thing tomorrow and we can talk about it in detail then ."
贾蓉忙 应 几个 “ 是 ” 。,Jia Rong promised to retail this message .
贾蔷又 近前 回说 ： “ 下 姑苏 请聘 教习 ， 采买 女孩子 ， 置办 乐器行 头等 事 ， 大爷 派 了 侄儿 ， 带领 着赖 管家 两个 儿子 ， 还有 单聘仁 、 卜固修 两个 清客 相公 ， 一同 前去 ， 所以 叫 我 来 见 叔叔 。 ”,"Jia Qiang now stepped forward with a message of his own : ' Uncle Zhen has given me the job of going to Soochow to engage music and drama teachers and to buy girl players and instruments and costumes so that we can have our own theatricals for the visitation . I am to take Lai Sheng is two sons with me ; and two of Great-uncle Zheng 's gentlemen , Shan Pin-ren and Bu Gu-xiu , are coming as well . Uncle said I ought to have a word with you about it before I go . '"
贾琏 听 了 ， 将 贾蔷 打量 了 打量 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你 能够 在 行么 ？,Jia Lian looked the youth up and down appraisingly and laughed : ' Do you think you are qualified for the job ?
这个 事 虽 不 甚 大 ， 里头 却 有 藏掖 的 。 ”,"It may not be a very big one , but I should say the pickings would be pretty good for someone who knew the ropes . '"
贾蔷笑 道 ： “ 只好 学 着 办 罢 咧 。 ”,Jia Qiang laughed too . ' I shall have to learn as I go along ! '
贾蓉 在 灯影 儿 后头 悄悄的 拉 凤姐儿 的 衣裳 襟儿 ， 凤姐 会意 ， 也 悄悄的 摆手 儿 佯作 不知 。,"Jia Rong , who was standing somewhat away from the light , availed himself of the shadow 's concealment to give Xi-feng 's dress a surreptitious tug . She understood perfectly well what his meaning was , but pretended not to , dismissing him with a curt wave of the hand and addressing herself instead to Jia Lian :"
因 笑 道 ： “ 你 也 太 操心 了 ！,"' Do not be so officious , Lian !"
难道 大爷 比 咱们 还 不会 用人 ？,Cousin Zhen is no less capable of choosing the right person for the job than we are .
偏 你 又 怕 他 不在 行 了 。,What do you mean by asking the boy if he is qualified ?
谁 都 是 在行 的 ？,He is as much qualified as any of the rest of us .
孩子 们 这么 大 了 ， ‘ 没吃过 猪肉 ， 也 见 过 猪 跑 。 ’,"He is old enough to have seen a pig run , even if he is not old enough to have eaten pork !"
大爷 派 他 去 ， 原 不过 是 个 坐 纛 旗儿 ， 难道 认真 的 叫 他 讲价钱 会 经纪 去 呢 ！,"In any case , I am sure Cousin Zhen only chose him as a figurehead . You do not seriously suppose that he will be the one to discuss prices and deal with the business side of the expedition ?"
依 我 说 ， 很 好 。 ”,- I think myself it is a very good choice !
贾琏 道 ： “ 这 是 自然 。,"' Of course it is , ' said Jia Lian ."
不是 我 驳回 ， 少不得 替 他 筹算 筹算 。 ”,' I do not dispute it . I merely thought we ought to do a few of his sums for him before he goes .
因 问 ： “ 这 一项 银子 动 那 一处 的 ？ ”,Where is the money for this coming from ? ' he asked Jia Qiang .
贾蔷道 ： “ 刚才 也 议到 这里 。,"' We were discussing that just now , ' said Jia Qiang ."
赖 爷爷 说 ， 竟 不用 从 京 里 带 银子 去 。,' Gaffer Lai says that there is no point in taking money with us from here .
江南 甄家 还 收 着 我们 五万 银子 。 明日 写 一封 书信 会票 我们 带 去 ， 先 支 三万两 ， 剩 二万 存 着 ， 等 置办 彩灯 花烛 并 各色 帘帐 的 使用 。 ”,"He says the Zhens of Kiangnan hold fifty thousand taels of ours on deposit and he can give us a letter of credit to take to them when we go . We will draw out thirty thousand first and leave the rest to buy lanterns , lamps , and curtains with later on . '"
贾琏 点头 道 ： “ 这个 主意 好 。 ”,Jia Lian nodded appreciatively . ' Good idea . '
凤姐忙 向 贾蔷道 ： “ 既 这么着 ， 我 有 两个 妥当 人 ， 你 就 带 了 去 办 。,"' Well , if that is all settled , ' Xi-feng put in quickly , ' I have got two very reliable young men for you to take with you , Qiang ."
这 可 便宜 你 。 ”,I am sure you will find them extremely useful . '
贾蔷忙 陪笑 道 ： “ 正要 和 婶婶 讨 两个 人 呢 ， 这 可巧 了 。 ”,' What a coincidence ! ' said Jia Qiang . ' I was just about to ask if you could recommend a couple of helpers ! '
因 问 名字 。 凤姐 便 问 赵嬷嬷 。,"He asked for their names , and Xi-feng turned to Nannie Zhao to supply them ."
彼时 赵嬷嬷 已 听 呆 了 ， 平儿 笑 着 推 他 ， 才 醒悟 过来 ， 忙 说 ： “ 一个 叫 赵 天梁 ， 一个 叫 赵天栋 。 ”,"But the old nurse was so bemused by all this talk of policy and high finance that she appeared to be in a sort of coma , which it took a sharp nudge from Patience to rouse her from . When she answered it was in a gabble , to make up for the awkward pause . ' One of them is called Zhao Tian-liang , the other is called Zhao Tian-dong . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 可 别忘了 。,' Mind you do not forget ! ' said Xi-feng .
我 干 我 的 去 了 。 ”,Now I am off to see to my own affairs . '
说 着 便 出去 了 。,And she left the room .
贾蓉忙 跟 出来 ， 悄悄的 笑 向凤姐 道 ： “ 你 老人家 要 什么 ， 开 个 账儿 带去 ， 按着 置办 了来 。 ”,"Jia Rong slipped out after her . ' If you will make a list of all the things you want , ' he said , smilingly and softly , ' I will see that he gets them for you , gracious lady . '"
凤姐 笑 着 碎道 ： “ 别 放 你 娘 的 屁 ！,' Gracious arsehole ! ' said Xi-feng .
你 拿 东西 换 我 的 人情 来 了 吗 ？,' Do you think you can buy my favour with a few knick-knacks ?
我 很 不 希罕 你 那 鬼鬼祟祟 的 ！ ”,I do not like all this whispering in corners . '
说 着 一 笑 走 了 。,She walked away without giving him a chance to reply .
这里 贾蔷也 问 贾琏 ： “ 要 什么 东西 ， 顺便 织来 孝敬 。 ”,"Meanwhile Jia Qiang was making a somewhat similar proposal to Jia Lian . ' If there is anything I can get for you while I am away , Uncle , I shall be glad to wangle it . '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 你 别 兴头 。,"' My , my ! ' said Jia Lian . ' Let's not get carried away , then !"
才学 着 办事 ， 到先 学会 了 这 把戏 。,"I must say , for one who is only just started , you certainly havent lost much time in picking up the tricks of the trade !"
短 了 什么 ， 少不得 写信 来 告诉 你 。 ”,"Yes , I dare say I shall write and let you know if I find I am short of anything . '"
说 毕 ， 打发 他 二人 去 了 。,With these words he sent the two young men back to the other house .
接着 回事 的 人 不止 三 四起 ， 贾琏 乏 了 ， 便 传 与 二门 上 ， 一应 不许 传报 ， 俱 待 明日 料理 。,"Their departure was followed by a succession of three or four visits by servants reporting on household matters , after which he felt so exhausted that he instructed the servants on the inner gate to refuse admittance to any others and to inform them that he would deal with their business next day ."
凤姐 至 三 更 时分 方 下来 安歇 。,It was midnight by the time Xi-feng got back to bed .
一 宿 无 话 。,But the affairs of that night are no part of our story .
次日 贾琏 起来 ， 见 过 贾 赦贾 政 ， 便 往 宁国府 中来 ， 合同 老 管事 的 家人 等 ， 并 几位 世交 门下 清客 相公 们 ， 审察 两府 地方 ， 缮画 省亲 殿宇 ， 一面 参度 办理 人丁 。,"Rising early next morning , Jia Lian first called on his father and uncles and then went to the Ning-guo mansion , where , with Cousin Zhen , he joined a group consisting of the older stewards and domestics and a few friends and clients of the family in making a complete survey of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties with a view to deciding where the various buildings of the Separate Residence should be sited . He also helped them interview the craftsmen who would undertake the work ."
自 此后 ， 各行 匠役 齐全 ， 金银铜 锡 以及 土木 砖瓦 之物 ， 搬运 移送 不 歇 。,"After the assembling of builders and artisans the assembling of materials began : a continuous flow of supplies converging on the site from every direction , from precious consignments of gold , silver , copper and tin , to huge , bulky loads of builder 's clay , timber , bricks and tiles ."
先令 匠 役 拆 宁府 会 芳园 的 墙垣 楼阁 ， 直接 入 荣府 东大 院中 。,"Various walls , including the surrounding walls of the All-scents Garden , and some of the garden 's pavilions were demolished so that the north-west part of the Ning-guo property and the large open court on the north-east side of Rong-guo House were thrown into a single site ."
荣府 东边 所有 下 人 一带 群房 已尽 拆去 。,A range of servants ' quarters on the east side of the Rong-guo grounds had already been demolished .
当日 宁荣二 宅 ， 虽 有 一条 小巷 界断 不通 ， 然 亦 系 私地 ， 并非 官道 ， 故 可以 联络 。,"The Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties had previous to this been divided by an alley-way running from north to south between them , but as it was not a public thoroughfare , no problem was involved in closing it and incorporating part of it in the rest of the new site ."
会 芳园 本 是从 北 墙角 下引 了 来 的 一股 活水 ， 今 亦 无烦 再 引 。,"The All-scents Garden had been watered by a stream led in by a culvert which ran under a corner of the north wall . Now that the garden was being integrated in the larger site , it was no longer necessary to lead the water in at this point ."
其 山 树木 石 虽 不 敷用 ， 贾 赦住 的 乃是 荣府 旧园 ， 其中 竹树 山石 以及 亭榭 栏杆 等物 ， 皆 可 挪 就 前来 。,"The artificial hills , rocks , trees and shrubs of All-scents Garden were , of course , insufficient for the whole of the new site ; but the area occupied by Jia She was the original garden of Rong-guo House and plentifully supplied with bamboos , trees , rocks , pavilions , kiosks and pergolas capable of being moved elsewhere ."
如此 两处 又 甚 近 便 ， 凑成 一处 ， 省 许多 财力 ， 大概 算计 起来 ， 所添 有限 。,"By pooling the resources of these two gardens - the All-scents Garden of Ning-guo House and the original Rong-guo garden where Jia She lived - and redistributing them over a single area , it would be possible to make great economies in both labour and materials , and when the estimates came to be made it was found that the requirements , in terms of completely new materials , would be comparatively modest ."
全亏 一个 胡老名 公 ， 号 山子野 ， 一 一筹 画 起造 。,The conception as a whole and the designs for its execution were alike the work of a well-known landscape gardener familiar to all and sundry by the sobriquet of ' Horticultural Hu ' .
贾政 不 惯于 俗务 ， 只 凭 贾 赦 、 贾珍 、 贾琏 、 赖大 、 赖升 ， 林之孝 、 吴新登 、 詹光 、 程日兴 等 几 人 安插 摆布 。,"Jia Zheng was unused to matters of a practical nature and left the management of men and the control of operations to a consortium consisting of Jia She , Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian , the stewards Lai Da , Lai Sheng and Lin Zhi-xiao , the Clerk of Stores Wu Xin-deng , and two of his literary gentlemen , Zhan Guang and Cheng Ri-xing ."
堆山 凿池 ， 起楼 竖阁 ， 种 竹 栽花 ， 一应 点 景 ， 又 有 山子野 制度 。,"The digging of pools , the raising of hills , the siting and erection of lodges and pavilions , the planting of bamboos and flowers - in a word , all matters pertaining to the landscaping and layout of the gardens , were planned and supervised by Horticultural Hu."
下 朝 闲暇 ， 不过 各处 看望 看望 ， 最 要紧 处 和 贾 赦等 商议 商议 便 罢了 。,Jia Zheng would merely drop in occasionally when he got back from Court and look around . On any important matters he sought the advice of Jia She and the rest .
贾 赦只 在家 高卧 ， 有 芥豆 之 事 ， 贾珍 等 或 自去 回明 ， 或 写略 节 ， 或 有 话 说 ， 便 传呼 贾琏 赖 大 等 来 领命 。,"Jia She led a life of cultured ease and never did anything . On routine matters of no great importance Cousin Zhen would either report to him in person or send him a brief note when the thing was done . If consultation was unavoidable , he would send along Lai Da or one of the others for a reply ."
贾蓉 单管 打造 金银 器皿 。,Jia Rong 's sole task was to supervise the making of objects in gold and silver .
贾蔷已 起身 往 姑苏 去 了 。,Jia Qiang had already left for Soochow .
贾珍 赖 大 等 又 点 人丁 ， 开册 籍 ， 监工 等 事 。,"Cousin Zhen , Lai Da and the rest were the ones who did most of the real work . It was they who hired workmen , kept accounts , and supervised and inspected each job as it was undertaken ."
一笔 不能 写 到 ， 不过 是 喧 阗 热闹 而已 。 暂且 无 话 。,"The amount of noise and activity generated by these operations could not be described in a few words , and for the time being we shall not attempt the task ."
且说 宝玉 近因 家中 有 这 等 大事 ， 贾政 不 来 问 他 的 书 ， 心中 自 是 畅快 ；,The family 's recent preoccupation with these important developments had released Bao-yu from his father 's periodical quizzing about the progress of his studies .
无奈 秦钟 之 病 ， 日 重 一日 ， 也 着实 悬心 ， 不能 快乐 。,"Unfortunately the relief of mind which this would otherwise have afforded him was displaced by a grave concern for Qin Zhong , whose sickness seemed to be daily worsening . Under such circumstances it was impossible for him to feel happy about anything else ."
这日 一早 起来 ， 才 梳洗 了 ， 意欲 回 了 贾母 去 望候 秦钟 ， 忽 见 茗 烟 在 二门 影壁 前 探头缩脑 ， 宝玉 忙 出来 问 他 ： “ 做 什么 ？ ”,"One morning , just as he had finished washing and dressing and was thinking of going round to Grandmother Jia to ask if he might pay Qin Zhong another visit , he caught sight of Tealeaf dodging about behind the screen wall of the inner gate and evidently trying to catch his attention . Bao-yu hurried over to him . ' What is it ? '"
茗 烟道 ： “ 秦 大爷 不中用 了 ！ ”,' Master Qin . He is dying ! '
宝玉 听 了 ， 吓了一跳 ， 忙 问道 ： “ 我 昨儿 才 瞧 了 他 还 明明白白 的 ， 怎么 就 不中用 了 呢 ？ ”,Bao-yu was stunned . ' Dying ? When I saw him yesterday he seemed quite lucid . How can he be dying so soon ? '
茗 烟道 ： “ 我 也 不 知道 ， 刚才 是 他家 的 老头子 来 特 告诉 我 的 。 ”,"' I do not know , ' said Tealeaf . ' But that is what the old gaffer said just now who came round to tell me . '"
宝玉 听毕 ， 忙 转身 回 明贾母 ， 贾母 吩咐 派 妥当 人 跟去 ， “ 到 那里 尽一尽 同窗 之 情 就 回来 ， 不 许多 耽搁 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu hurried back and told Grandmother Jia . She instructed some of the more reliable servants to go with him and briefly admonished him before he went : ' When you get there you may stay with him to the end , since you have been such good friends ; but you must come back as soon as it is over . Do not hang about ! '"
宝玉 忙 出来 更衣 。 到 外边 ， 车 犹 未备 ， 急 的 满厅 乱转 ， 一时 催促 的 车 到 ， 忙 上 了 车 ， 李贵茗 烟 等 跟随 。,"Bao-yu hurried off to change , only to find , on re-emerging , that the carriage was still not ready . Anxious lest he should arrive too late , he ran up and down the courtyard in a frenzy of impatience , imploring the servants to make haste ; and when it at last arrived , he flung himself in it and drove off at great speed , hotly pursued by Li Gui , Tealeaf and the others attending him ."
来 至 秦 家门 首 ， 悄无一人 ， 遂 蜂拥 至 内室 ， 吓 的 秦钟 的 两个 远房 婶娘 、 嫂子 并 几个 姐妹 ， 都藏 之 不迭 。,"The house , when they reached it , appeared silent and deserted . Entering together in a tight little knot , master and servants surged through like swarming bees to the inner apartment at the back where Qin Zhong lay , causing great consternation among the two aunts and half-dozen girl cousins who were tending him and who were unable to conceal themselves before the advent of this masculine invasion ."
此时 秦钟 已 发过 两三次 昏 ， 易 箦 多 时 矣 。,"At this stage Qin Zhong had already lost consciousness several times and , in accordance with the Northern custom which forbids a sick man to breathe his last on the kang , had some time since been lifted on to a trestle bed to die ."
宝玉 一 见 ， 便 不禁 失声 的 哭 起来 。,Bao-yu gave an involuntary cry when he saw where he was lying and broke into noisy weeping .
李贵忙 劝道 ： “ 不可 ， 秦 哥儿 是 弱 症 ， 怕 炕 上 硌 的 不 受用 ， 所以 暂且 挪 下来 松泛 些 。,He was quickly restrained by Li Gui : ' You know how delicate Master Qin is . I expect the kang was too hard for him and they have put him here so that he can lie a bit more easy .
哥儿 这一 哭 ， 倒 添 了 他 的 病 了 。 ”,You must not cry like that or you will make him worse ! '
宝玉 听 了 ， 方 忍住 近前 ， 见 秦 钟面 如 白蜡 ， 合目 呼吸 ， 展转 枕上 。,"Bao-yu held back his sobs and drew close to his dying friend . Qin Zhong is face was waxen . His eyes were closed tight and he seemed to breathe with difficulty , twisting his head from side to side on the pillow ."
宝玉 忙 叫 道 ： “ 鲸哥 ！ 宝玉 来 了 。 ”,"' Jing-qing , old fellow ! Its me ! Its Bao-yu ! '"
连 叫 了 两三声 ， 秦钟 不睬 。,"- He called him several times , but Qin Zhong seemed unaware of his presence ."
宝玉 又 叫 道 ： “ 宝玉 来 了 。 ”,Again he called : ' It is Bao-yu ! '
那秦钟 早已 魂魄 离身 ， 只 剩得 一口 悠悠 余气 在 胸 ， 正 见 许多 鬼 判持 牌 提索 来 捉 他 。 那秦钟 魂魄 那里 肯 就 去 ？,"In point of fact Qin Zhong 's soul had already left his body and the few faint gasps of breath in his failing lungs were the only life that now remained in it . The ministers of the underworld , armed with a warrant and chains to bind him with , were at that very moment confronting him ; but his soul was refusing to go quietly ."
又 记念 着 家中 无人 管理家务 ， 又 惦记着 智能 儿 尚无 下落 ， 因此 百般 求告 鬼 判 。,"Remembering that he left no one behind him to look after his family 's affairs , and bethinking him of poor Sapientia whose whereabouts were still unknown , he entreated them most piteously to spare him ."
无奈 这些 鬼判 都 不肯 狗 私 ， 反 叱咤 秦钟道 ： “ 亏 你 还是 读 过 书 的 人 ， 岂不知 俗语说 的 ： ‘ 阎王 叫 你 三 更 死 ， 谁 敢留 人 到 五更 。 ’,But the infernal visitants had no ear for his entreaties and silenced him with angry rebuke : ' You are an educated young fellow : haven ' t you heard the saying If Yama calls at midnight hour No man can put off death till four - ?
我们 阴间 上下 都 是 铁面无私 的 ， 不 比 阳间 瞻情顾意 ， 有 许多 的 关碍 处 。 ”,"We ministers of the nether world , from the highest down to the lowest , all have unbending iron natures and - unlike the officials of the mortal world , who are always doing kindnesses and showing favours and inventing little tricks and dodges for frustrating the course of justice - we are incapable of showing partiality . '"
正 闹 着 ， 那秦钟 的 魂魄 忽 听见 “ 宝玉 来 了 ” 四 字 ， 便 忙 又 央求 道 ： “ 列位 神差 略 慈悲 慈悲 ， 让 我 回去 ， 和 一个 好 朋友 说 一句 话 ， 就 来 了 。 ”,"Suddenly , above their angry shouting , Qin Zhong heard a tiny cry : ' It is Bao-yu ! ' At once he renewed his entreaties : ' Good gentlemen , be merciful ! Give me just a moment for a few words with a very dear friend of mine , and I will be back directly ! '"
众 鬼 道 ； “ 又 是 什么 好 朋友 ？ ”,' What is it now ? ' asked the demons . ' What friend ? '
秦钟道 ： “ 不 瞒 列位 ： 就是 荣国公 的 孙子 ， 小名儿 叫 宝玉 的 。 ”,"' I will not deceive you , gentlemen . It is a descendant of the Duke of Rong-guo . His name is Bao-yu . '"
那 判官 听 了 ， 先 就 唬 的 慌张起来 ， 忙 喝 骂 那些 小鬼 道 ： “ 我 说 你们 放 了 他 回去 走走 罢 ， 你们 不依 我 的话 。,"' What ? ' screamed the officer in charge of the party in great alarm . He turned angrily on his demon minions : ' I told you we ought to let him go back for a bit , but you would not listen . Now look what is happened !"
如今 闹 的 请出 个 运旺时盛 的 人 来 了 。,He is gone and called up a person full of life and health to come here right in our midst !
怎么 好 ？ ”,This is terrible ! '
众鬼见 都 判 如此 ， 也 都 忙 了 手脚 ， 一面 又 抱怨 道 ： “ 你 老人家 先是 那么 ‘ 雷霆 火炮 ’ ， 原来 见 不得 ‘ 宝玉 ’ 二 字 。,"The demons showed signs of disarray on observing their leader to be so affected , and there was some angry muttering : ' Yer Honour was putting on a brave enough show a short while ago . Why should the name "" Bao-yu "" throw you into such a state of commotion ?"
依 我们 想来 ， 他 是 阳间 ， 我们 是 阴间 ， 怕 他 亦 无益 。,"If you ask us , seeing that he is upper world and we are lower world , there is nothing to be afraid of ."
〈 不如 拿 了 秦钟 一 走 完事 。 ”,We might just as well carry this one off now and have done with it . '
,"The trepidation of their leader , who was perhaps thinking more of Bao-yu 's demonrepelling talisman than of its wearer , was far from comforted by this reflection ."
判官 闻听 ， 连 喝 不可 。 于是 将 秦钟 魂魄 放 回 。,"' No ! No ! No ! ' he shouted , and compelled them to let the soul return to its body ."
苏醒过来 ， 睁 眼见 宝玉 在 旁 ， 怎奈 痰 堵 喉头 ， 不能 出语 。,With the return of his soul Qin Zhong regained consciousness and opened his eyes . He could see Bao-yu standing beside him ; but his throat was so choked with phlegm that he was unable to utter a word .
只 翻眼 将 宝玉 看 了 一看 ， 头 摇一摇 ， 听 喉 内 哼 了 一声 ， 遂 瞑 然而 游 。,He could only fasten his eyes on him and slowly shake his head . Then there was a rasping sound in his throat and he slid once more into the dark .
后事 如何 ， 且 听 下回分解 。 〉,What followed will be told in the following chapter .
第十七回,Chapter 17
大观园 试才 题对额,The inspection of the new garden becomes a test of talent
荣国府 归省 庆 元宵,And Rong-guo House makes itself ready for an important visitor
话 说 秦钟 既 死 ， 宝玉 痛哭 不止 ， 李贵 等 好容易 劝解 半日方 住 ， 归 时 还 带 余哀 。,"Now that Qin Zhong was indisputably dead , Bao-yu wept long and bitterly , and it was some time before Li Gui and the rest could calm him . Even after their return he continued tearful and distressed ."
贾母 帮 了 几十两 银子 ， 外 又 另备 奠仪 ， 宝玉 去 吊祭 。 七日 后 便 送殡 掩埋 了 ， 别 无 记述 。,"Grandmother Jia contributed thirty or forty taels towards Qin Zhong 's funeral expenses and made additional provision for offerings to the dead . Bao-yu condoled and sacrificed , and on the seventh day followed his friend 's coffin to the grave ."
只有 宝玉 日日 感悼 ， 思念 不已 ， 然 亦 无可如何 了 。 又 不知 过 了 几时 才 罢 。,"He continued in daily grief for Qin Zhong for a very long time afterwards . But grief can not mend our losses , and a day did at last arrive when he had ceased to mourn ."
这 日贾珍 等 来回 贾政 ： “ 园内 工程 俱 已 告竣 ， 大老爷 已 瞧 过 了 ， 只 等 老爷 瞧 了 ， 或 有 不妥 之 处 ， 再行 改造 ， 好题 匾额 对联 。 ”,"One day Cousin Zhen came to Jia Zheng with his team of helpers to report that work on the new garden had been completed . ' Uncle She has already had a look , ' said Cousin Zhen . ' Now we are only waiting for you to look round it to tell us if there is anything you think will need altering and also to decide what inscriptions ought to be used on the boards everywhere . '"
贾政听 了 ， 沉思 一会 ， 说道 ： “ 这 匾 对 倒 是 一件 难事 ： 论礼 该 请 贵妃 赐 题 才 是 。 然 贵妃 若 不 亲观 其 景 ， 亦 难 悬拟 。,"Jia Zheng reflected a while in silence . ' These inscriptions are going to be difficult , ' he said eventually . ' By rights , of course , Her Grace should have the privilege of doing them herself ; but she can scarcely be expected to make them up out of her head without having seen any of the views which they are to describe ."
若 直待 贵妃 游幸 时 再行 请题 ， 若大 景致 ， 若干 亭榭 ， 无字 标题 ， 任 是 花柳 山水 ， 也断 不能 生色 。 ”,"On the other hand , if we wait until she has already visited the garden before asking her , half the pleasure of the visit will be lost . All those prospects and pavilions - even the rocks and trees and flowers will seem somehow incomplete without that touch of poetry which only the written word can lend a scene . '"
众 清客 在 旁 笑 答道 ： “ 老世翁 所见 极 是 。,"' My dear patron , you are so right , ' said one of the literary gentlemen who sat with him ."
如今 我们 有个 主意 ： 各处 匾 对断 不可 少 ， 亦 断 不可 定 。,"' But we have had an idea . The inscriptions for the various parts of the garden obviously can not be dispensed with ; nor , equally obviously , can they be decided in advance ."
如今 且 按 其 景致 ， 或 两 字 、 三 字 、 四 字 ， 虚合 其意 拟 了 来 ， 暂且 做出 灯 匾 对联 悬 了 ， 待 贵妃 游幸 时 ， 再 请 定名 ， 岂 不 两全 ？ ”,"Our suggestion is that we should compose provisional names and couplets to suit the places where inscriptions are required , and have them painted on rectangular paper lanterns which can be hung up temporarily - either horizontally or vertically as the case may be - when Her Grace comes to visit . We can ask her to decide on the permanent names after she has inspected the garden . Is not this a solution of the dilemma ? '"
贾政听 了道 ： “ 所见 不 差 。,"' It is indeed , ' said Jia Zheng ."
我们 今日 且 看看 去 ， 只管 题 了 ， 若 妥便 用 ； 若 不妥 ， 将雨 村 请来 ， 令 他 再 拟 。 ”,"' When we look round the garden presently , we must all try to think of words that can be used . If they seem suitable , we can keep them for the lanterns . If not , we can call for Yu-cun to come and help us out . '"
众人 笑 道 ： “ 老爷 今日 一 拟定 佳 ， 何必 又 待 雨 村 。 ”,"' Your own suggestions are sure to be admirable , Sir Zheng , ' said the literary gentlemen ingratiatingly . ' There will be no need to call in Yu-cun . '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ 你们 不知 ： 我 自幼 于 花鸟 山水 题咏 上 就 平平的 ， 如今 上 了 年纪 ， 且 案牍 劳烦 ， 于 这 怡情悦性 的 文章 更 生疏 了 。,"Jia Zheng smiled deprecatingly . ' I am afraid it is not as you imagine . In my youth I had at best only indifferent skill in the art of writing verses about natural objects - birds and flowers and scenery and the like ; and now that I am older and have to devote all my energies to official documents and government papers , I am even more out of touch with this sort of thing than I was then ;"
便 拟 出来 ， 也 不免 迂腐 ， 反使 花柳 园亭 因而 减色 ， 转 没意思 。 ”,"so that even if I were to try my hand at it , I fear that my efforts would be rather dull and pedantic ones . Instead of enhancing the interest and beauty of the garden , they would probably have a deadening effect upon both . '"
众 清客 道 ： “ 这 也 无妨 。,"' That does not matter , ' the literary gentlemen replied ."
我们 大家 看 了 公拟 ， 各 举 所长 ， 优则 存 之 ， 劣 则 删 之 ， 未为不可 。 ”,"' We can all try our hands at composing . If each of us contributes what he is best at , and if we then select the better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good , we should be able to manage all right . '"
贾政道 ： “ 此论 极 是 。,"' That seems to me a very good suggestion , ' said Jia Zheng ."
且 喜 今日 天气 和暖 ， 大家 去 逛逛 。 ”,"As the weather today is so warm and pleasant , let us all go and take a turn round the garden now ! '"
说 着 ， 起身 引 众人 前往 。,So saying he rose to his feet and conducted his little retinue of literary luminaries towards the garden .
贾珍先 去 园中 知会 。,Cousin Zhen hurried on ahead to warn those in charge that they were coming .
可巧 近日 宝玉 因 思念 秦钟 ， 忧伤 不已 ， 贾母常 命 人 带 他 到 新 园子 里 来 玩耍 。,"As Bao-yu was still in very low spirits these days because of his grief for Qin Zhong , Grandmother Jia had hit on the idea of sending him into the newly made garden to play ."
,By unlucky chance she had selected this very day on which to try out her antidote .
此时 也 才 进去 ， 忽 见 贾珍 来 了 ， 和 他 笑 道 ： “ 你 还 不快 出去 呢 ， 一会 子 老爷 就 来 了 。 ”,He had in fact only just entered the garden when Cousin Zhen came hurrying towards him . ' Better get out of here ! ' said Cousin Zhen with an amused smile . ' Your father will be here directly ! '
宝玉 听 了 ， 带 着 奶娘 小厮 们 ， 一溜烟 跑 出 园 来 。,"Bao-yu streaked back towards the gate , a string of nurses and pages hurrying at his heels ."
方 转过 弯 ， 顶头 看见 贾政 引着 众客 来 了 ， 躲 之 不及 ， 只得 一旁 站住 。,But he had only just turned the corner on coming out of it when he almost ran into the arms of Jia Zheng and his party coming from the opposite direction . Escape was impossible . He simply had to stand meekly to one side and await instructions .
贾政 近来 闻得代 儒 称赞 他 专能对 对 ， 虽 不 喜 读书 ， 却 有些 歪才 ， 所以 此时 便命 他 跟入 园中 ， 意欲 试 他一 试 。,"Jia Zheng had recently received a favourable report on Bao-yu from his teacher Jia Dai-ru in which mention had been made of his skill in composing couplets . Although the boy showed no aptitude for serious study , Dai-ru had said , he nevertheless possessed a certain meretricious talent for versification not undeserving of commendation . Because of this report , Jia Zheng ordered Bao-yu to accompany him into the garden , intending to put his aptitude to the test ."
宝玉 未知 何意 ， 只得 随往 。,"Bao-yu , who knew nothing either of Dai-ru 's report or of his father 's intentions , followed with trepidation ."
刚至 园门 ， 只见 贾珍 带领 许多 执事 人 旁边 侍立 。,As soon as they reached the gate they found Cousin Zhen at the head of a group of overseers waiting to learn Jia Zheng 's wishes .
贾政道 ： “ 你 且 把 园门 关上 ， 我们 先 瞧 外面 ， 再 进去 。 ”,"' I want you to close the gate , ' said Jia Zheng , ' so that we can see what it looks like from outside before we go in . '"
贾珍命 人 将门 关上 ， 贾政先 秉正 看门 ， 只见 正门 五间 ， 上面 筒瓦 泥鳅 脊 ；,"Cousin Zhen ordered the gate to be closed , and Jia Zheng stood back and studied it gravely . It was a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles ."
那 门 栏 窗 槅 ， 俱 是 细雕 时 新花样 ， 并 无 朱粉 涂饰 ， 一色 水磨 群墙 ；,"The wooden lattice-work of the doors and windows was finely carved and ingeniously patterned . The whole gatehouse was quite unadorned by colour or gilding , yet all was of the most exquisite workmanship ."
下面 白石 台阶 ， 凿成 西番莲 花样 。 左右 一 望 ， 雪白 粉墙 ， 下面 虎皮 石 ， 砌成 纹理 ， 不 落 富丽 俗套 ： 自 是 喜欢 。 遂 命 开门 进去 。,"Its walls stood on a terrace of white marble carved with a pattern of passion-flowers in relief , and the garden 's whitewashed circumference wall to left and right of it had a footing made of black-and-white striped stone blocks arranged so that the stripes formed a simple pattern . Jia Zheng found the unostentatious simplicity of this entrance greatly to his liking , and after ordering the gates to be opened , passed on inside ."
只见 一带 翠 嶂 挡 在 面前 。 众 清客 都 道 ： “ 好 山 ， 好 山 ！ ”,"A cry of admiration escaped them as they entered , for there , immediately in front of them , screening everything else from their view , rose a steep , verdure-clad hill ."
贾政道 ： “ 非此 一山 ， 一 进来 园中 所有 之 景 悉 入 目 中 ， 更 有 何趣 ？ ”,"' Without this hill , ' Jia Zheng somewhat otiosely observed , ' the whole garden would be visible as one entered , and all its mystery would be lost . '"
众人 都 道 ： “ 极 是 。,The literary gentlemen concurred .
非 胸中 大 有 丘壑 ， 焉能 想到 这里 。 ”,"' Only a master of the art of landscape could have conceived so bold a stroke , ' said one of them ."
说 毕 ， 往前 一 望 ， 见 白石 崚嶒 ， 或如 鬼怪 ， 或 似 猛兽 ， 纵横 拱立 ； 上面 苔辞 斑驳 ， 或 藤萝 掩映 ： 其中 微露 羊肠小径 。,"As they gazed at this miniature mountain , they observed a great number of large white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes , rising course above course up one of its sides , some recumbent , some upright or leaning at angles , their surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half concealed by creepers , and with a narrow , zigzag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between them ."
贾政道 ： “ 我们 就 从此 小径 游 去 ， 回来 由 那 一边 出去 ， 方可 遍览 。 ”,"' Let us begin our tour by following this path , ' said Jia Zheng . ' If we work our way round towards the other side of the hill on our way back , we shall have made a complete circuit of the garden . '"
说 毕 ， 命 贾珍 前导 ， 自己 扶 了 宝玉 ， 逶迤 走进 山口 。,"He ordered Cousin Zhen to lead the way , and leaning on Bao-yu 's shoulder , began the winding ascent of the little mountain ."
抬头 忽 见 山上 有 镜面 白石 一块 ， 正是 迎面 留题 处 。,"Suddenly on the mountainside above his head , he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smoothness and realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an inscription ."
贾政回 头 笑 道 ： “ 诸公 请 看 ， 此处 题 以 何 名 方妙 ？ ”,"' Aha , gentlemen ! ' said Jia Zheng turning back to address the others who were climbing up behind him . ' What name are we going to choose for this mountain ? '"
众人 听说 ， 也 有 说 该 题 “ 叠翠 ” 二 字 的 ， 也 有 说 该 题 “ 锦 嶂 ” 的 ， 又 有 说 “ 赛 香炉 ” 的 ， 又 有 说 “ 小 终南 ” 的 ， 种种 名色 ， 不止 几十个 。 原来 众客 心中 ， 早知 贾 政要 试 宝玉 的 才情 ， 故此 只 将 些 俗套 敷衍 。,"' Emerald Heights , ' said one . ' Embroidery Hill , ' said another . Another proposed that they should call it ' Little Censer ' after the famous Censer Peak in Kiangsi . Another proposed ' Little Zhong-nan ' . Altogether some twenty or thirty names were suggested - none of them very seriously , since the literary gentlemen were aware that Jia Zheng intended to test Bao-yu and were anxious not to make the boy 's task too difficult ."
宝玉 也 知 此 意 。,Bao-yu understood and was duly grateful .
贾政听 了 ， 便 回头 命 宝玉 拟来 。,When no more names were forthcoming Jia Zheng turned to Bao-yu and asked him to propose something himself .
宝玉 道 : “ 尝 听见 古人 说 : ‘ 编新 不如 述 旧 ， 刻古终胜雕 今 。 ’,"' I remember reading in some old book , ' said Bao-yu , ' that "" to recall old things is better than to invent new ones ; and to recut an ancient text is better than to engrave a modern "" ."
,"We ought , then , to choose something old ."
况 这里 并非 主山 正景 ， 原 无可 题 ， 不过 是 探景 的 一 进步 耳 。,"But as this is not the garden 's principal "" mountain "" or its chief vista , strictly speaking there is no justification for having an inscription here at all - unless it is to be something which implies that this is merely a first step towards more important things ahead ."
莫如 直 书 古人 ‘ 曲径通幽 ’ 这 旧 句 在 上 ， 倒 也 大方 。 ”,"I suggest we should call it "" Pathway to Mysteries "" after the line in Chang Jian 's poem about the mountain temple : A path winds upwards to mysterious places . A name like that would be more distinguished . '"
众人 听 了 ， 赞道 : “ 是 极 ， 好 极 ！,There was a chorus of praise from the literary gentlemen : ' Exactly right ! Wonderful !
二世 兄 天分 高 ， 才情 远 ， 不 似 我们 读腐 了 书 的 。 ”,Our young friend with his natural talent and youthful imagination succeeds immediately where we old pedants fail ! '
贾政笑 道 ： “ 不当 过奖 他 。,Jia Zheng gave a deprecatory laugh : ' You must not flatter the boy !
他 年 小 的 人 ， 不过 以 一 知充 十用 ， 取笑 罢了 。,"People of his age are adept at making a little knowledge go a long way . I only asked him as a joke , to see what he would say ."
再俟 选拟 。 ”,We shall have to think of a better name later on . '
说 着 ， 进入 石洞 ， 只见 佳木 茏葱 ， 奇花 烂漫 ， 一带 清流 ， 从 花木 深处 泻 于 石隙 之下 。,"As he spoke , they passed through a tunnel of rock in the mountain 's shoulder into an artificial ravine ablaze with the vari-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion . Down below , where the trees were thickest , a clear stream gushed between the rocks ."
再 进 数步 ， 渐向 北边 ， 平坦 宽豁 ， 两边 飞楼 插空 ， 雕 甍 绣 槛 ， 皆 隐于 山坳 树 杪 之间 。,"After they had advanced a few paces in a somewhat northerly direction , the ravine broadened into a little flat-bottomed valley and the stream widened out to form a pool . Gaily painted and carved pavilions rose from the slopes on either side , their lower halves concealed amidst the trees , their tops reaching into the blue ."
俯而视之 ， 但 见 青溪 泻 玉 ， 石 磴 穿 云 ， 白石 为 栏 ， 环抱 池沼 ， 石桥 三 港 ， 兽面 衔吐 。,"In the midst of the prospect below them was a handsome bridge : In a green ravine A jade stream sped . A stair of stone Plunged to the brink . Where the water widened To a placid pool , A marble baluster Ran round about . A marble bridge crossed it With triple span , And a marble lion 's maw Crowned each of the arches ."
桥上 有 亭 。 贾政 与 诸人 到 亭 内 坐 了 ， 问 ： “ 诸公 以 何题 此 ？ ”,"Over the centre of the bridge there was a little pavilion , which Jia Zheng and the others entered and sat down in . ' Well , gentlemen ! said Jia Zheng . ' ' What are we going to call it ? '"
诸人 都 道 ： “ 当日 欧阳 公 《 醉翁亭记 》 有 云 ： ‘ 有 亭翼然 ’ ， 就 名 ‘ 翼 然 ’ 罢 。 ”,"' Ou-yang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of "" a pavilion poised above the water "" , ' said one of them . ' What about "" Poised Pavilion "" ? '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ ‘ 翼 然 ’ 虽 佳 ， 但此 亭 压水 而 成 ， 还 须 偏于 水 题为 称 。,"' "" Poised Pavilion "" is good , ' said Jia Zheng , ' but this pavilion was put here in order to dominate the water it stands over , and I think there ought to be some reference to water in its name ."
依 我 拙裁 ， 欧阳 公句 ： ‘ 泻 于 两峰 之间 ’ ， 竟 用 他 这 一个 ‘ 泻 ’ 字 。 ”,"I seem to recollect that in that same essay you mention Ou-yang Xiu speaks of the water "" gushing between twin peaks "" . Could we not use the word "" gushing "" in some way ? '"
有 一 客道 ： “ 是 极 ， 是 极 。,"' Yes , yes ! ' said one of the literary gentlemen ."
竟是 ‘ 泻 玉 ’ 二 字 妙 。 ”,"' "" Gushing Jade "" would do splendidly . '"
贾政 拈须 寻思 ， 因 叫 宝玉 也 拟 一个 来 。,"Jia Zheng fondled his beard meditatively , then turned to Bao-yu and asked him for ks suggestion ."
宝玉 问道 ： “ 老爷 方才 所说 已 是 。 但 如今 追究 了去 ， 似乎 当日 欧阳 公题 ｛ 让 ｝ 泉 用 一 ‘ 泻 ’ 字 则 妥 ， 今日 此 泉 也 用 ‘ 泻 ’ 字 ， 似乎 不妥 。,"' I agreed with what you said just now , Father , ' said Bao-yu , ' but on second thoughts it seems to me that though it may have been all right for Ou-yang Xiu to use the word "" gushing "" in describing the source of the river Rang , it does not really suit the water round this pavilion ."
况 此处 既 为 省亲 别墅 ， 亦 当 依 应制 之 体 ， 用 此等 字 ， 亦 似 粗陋 不 雅 。,"Then again , as this is a Separate Residence specially designed for the reception of a royal personage , it seems to me that something rather formal is called for , and that an expression taken from the Drunkard 's Pavilion might seem a bit improper ."
求 再 拟 蕴藉 含蓄 者 。 ”,"I think we should try to find a rather more imaginative , less obvious sort of name . '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ 诸公 听 此论 何如 ？,' I hope you gentlemen are all taking this in ! ' said Jia Zheng sarcastically .
方才 众人 编新 ， 你 说 ‘ 不如 述古 ’ ； 如今 我们 述古 ， 你 又 说 ‘ 粗陋 不妥 ’ 。,"' You will observe that when we suggest something original we are recommended to prefer the old to the new , but that when we do make use of an old text we are "" improper "" and "" unimaginative "" !"
你 且说 你 的 。 ”,"- Well , carry on then ! Let's have your suggestion ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 用 ‘ 泻 玉 ’ 二 字 ， 则 不若 ‘ 沁 芳 ’ 二 字 ， 岂 不 新雅 ？ ”,"' I think "" Drenched Blossoms "" would be more original and more tasteful than "" Gushing Jade "" . '"
贾政 拈须 点头 不语 。,Jia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently .
众人 都 忙 迎合 ， 称赞 宝玉 才情 不凡 。,The literary gentlemen could see that he was pleased and hastened to commend Bao-yu 's remarkable ability .
贾政道 ： “ 匾 上 二 字 容易 。,"' That is the two words for the framed board on top , ' said Jia Zheng . ' Not a very difficult task ."
再 作 一副 七言 对 来 。 ”,But what about the seven-word lines for the sides ? '
宝玉 四 顾一望 ， 机上 心来 ， 乃 念道 ：,"Bao-yu glanced quickly round , seeking inspiration from the scene , and presently came up with the following couplet :"
绕 堤 柳 借 三 篙 翠 ，,"' Three pole-thrust lengths of bankside willows green ,"
隔岸 花分 一脉 香 。,One fragrant breath of bankside flowers sweet . '
贾政听 了 ， 点头 微笑 。,Jia Zheng nodded and a barely perceptible smile played over his features .
众人 又 称赞 了 一番 。,The literary gentlemen redoubled their praises .
于是 出 亭 过池 ， 一 山 一 石 ， 一花一木 ， 莫不 着意 观览 。 忽 抬头 见 前面 一带 粉垣 ， 数 楹 修舍 ， 有 千百 竿 翠竹 遮映 ， 众人 都 道 ： “ 好 个 所在 ！ ” 于是 大家 进入 ， 只见 进门 便是 曲折 游廊 ， 阶下 石子 漫成 甬路 ， 上面 小小 三间 房舍 ， 两 明一 暗 ， 里面 都 是 合 着 地步 打 的 床几 椅案 。,"They now left the pavilion and crossed to the other side of the pool . For a while they walked on , stopping from time to time to admire the various rocks and flowers and trees which they passed on their way , until suddenly they found themselves at the foot of a range of whitewashed walls enclosing a small retreat almost hidden among the hundreds and hundreds of green bamboos which grew in a dense thicket behind them . With cries of admiration they went inside . A cloister-like covered walk ran round the walls from the entrance to the back of the forecourt and a cobbled pathway led up to the steps of the terrace . The house was a tiny three-frame one , two parts latticed , the third part windowless . The tables , chairs and couches which furnished it seemed to have been specially made to fit the interior ."
从 里间 房里 ， 又 有 一小 门 ， 出去 却是 后园 ， 有 大株 梨花 ， 阔叶 芭蕉 ， 又 有 两间 小小 退步 。,A door in the rear wall opened onto a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flowering pear-tree and overlooked on either side by two diminutive lodges built at right angles to the back of the house .
后 院墙 下 忽开 一隙 ， 得 泉 一派 ， 开沟 尺 许 ， 灌入 墙内 ， 绕 阶缘 屋 至 前院 ， 盘旋 竹下 而 出 。,"A stream gushed through an opening at the foot of the garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran to the foot of the rear terrace and thence round the side of the house to the front , where it meandered through the bamboos of the forecourt before finally disappearing through another opening in the surrounding wall ."
贾政笑 道 ： “ 这 一处 倒 还好 ； 若 能 月夜 至此 窗下 读书 ， 也 不枉 虚生 一世 。 ”,"' This must be a pleasant enough place at any time , ' said Jia Zheng with a smile . ' But just imagine what it would be like to sit studying beside the window here on a moonlight night ! It is pleasures like that which make a man feel he has not lived in vain ! '"
说 着 ， 便 看 宝玉 ， 唬 的 宝玉 忙 垂 了 头 ， 众人 忙 用 闲话 解说 。,"As he spoke , his glance happened to fall on Bao-yu , who instantly became so embarrassed that he hung his head in shame . He was rescued by the timely intervention of the literary gentlemen who changed the subject from that of study to a less dangerous topic ."
又 二 客 说 ： “ 此处 的 匾 该 题 四个 字 。 ”,Two of them suggested that the name given to this retreat should be a four-word one .
贾政笑 问 ： “ 那 四 字 ？ ”,Jia Zheng asked them what four words they proposed .
一个 道 是 ： “ 淇 水 遗风 。 ”,"' "" Where Bends the Qi "" ' said one of them , no doubt having in mind the song in the Poetry Classic which begins with the words"
,See in that nook where bends the Qi
,"The green bamboos , how graceful grown !"
贾政道 ： “ 俗 。 ”,"' No , ' said Jia Zheng . ' Too obvious !"
又 一个 道 是 ： “ 睢园 遗迹 。 ”,"' "" North of the Sui "" , ' said the other , evidently thinking of the ancient Rabbit Garden of the Prince of Liang in Suiyang - also famous for its bamboos and running water ."
贾政道 ： “ 也 俗 。 ”,"' No , ' said Jia Zheng . ' Still too obvious ! '"
贾珍 在 旁 说道 ： “ 还是 宝兄弟 拟 一个 罢 。 ”,"' You would better ask Cousin Bao again , ' said Cousin Zhen , who stood by listening ."
贾政道 ： “ 他 未曾 做 ， 先 要 议论 人家 的 好歹 ， 可见 是 个 轻薄 东西 。 ”,"' He always insists on criticizing everyone else 's suggestions before he will deign to make one of his own , ' said Jia Zheng . ' He is a worthless creature . '"
众 客道 ： “ 议论 的 是 ， 也 无奈 他何 。 ”,"' That is all right , ' said the others . ' His criticisms are very good ones . He is in no way to blame for making them . '"
贾政忙 道 ： “ 休 如此 纵 了 他 。 ”,' You should not let him get away with it ! ' said Jia Zheng .
因 说道 ： “ 今日 任 你 狂为乱道 ， 等 说出 议论 来 ， 方许 你 做 。,"' All right ! ' he went on , turning to Bao-yu . ' Today we will indulge you up to the hilt . Let's have your criticisms , and after that we will hear your own proposal ."
方才 众人 说 的 ， 可 有 使得 的 没有 ？ ”,What about the two suggestions that have just been made ? Do you think either of them could be used ? '
宝玉 见 问 ， 便 答道 ： “ 都 似 不妥 。 ”,"' Neither of them seems quite right to me , ' said Bao-yu in answer to the question ."
贾政 冷笑 道 ： “ 怎么 不妥 ？ ”,"' In what way "" not quite right "" ? ' said Jia Zheng with a scornful smile ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 这 是 第一处 行幸 之 所 ， 必须 颂 圣 方可 。,"' Well , ' said Bao-yu , ' This is the first building our visitor will enter when she looks over the garden , so there ought to be some word of praise for the Emperor at this point ."
若 用 四 字 的 匾 ， 又 有 古人 现成 的 ， 何必 再 做 ？ ”,
,"If we want a classical reference with imperial symbolism , I suggest "" The Phoenix Dance "" , alluding to that passage in the History Classic about the male and female phoenixes alighting "" with measured gambollings "" in the Emperor 's courtyard . '"
贾政道 ： “ 难道 ‘ 淇 水 ’ 、 ‘ 睢园 ’ 不是 古人 的 ？ ”,"' What about "" Bend of the Qi "" and "" North of the Sui "" ? ' said Jia Zheng . ' Are not they classical allusions ?"
,"If not , I should like to know what they are ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 这 太板 了 。,"' Yes , ' said Bao-yu , ' but they are too contrived ."
莫若 ‘ 有凤来仪 ’ 四 字 。 ”,""" The Phoenix Dance "" is more fitting . '"
众人 都哄然 叫 妙 。,There was a loud murmur of assent from the literary gentlemen .
贾政 点头 道 ： “ 畜生 ， 畜生 ！ 可谓 ‘ 管窥蠡测 ’ 矣 。 ” 因命 ： “ 再题 一 联来 。 ”,"Jia Zheng nodded and tried not to look pleased . ' Young idiot ! - A "" small capacity but a great self-conceit "" , gentlemen - All right ! ' he ordered : ' now the couplet ! '"
宝玉 便 念道 :,So Bao-yu recited the following couplet :
宝鼎 茶 闲 烟 尚 绿 ，,' From the empty cauldron the steam still rises after the brewing of tea .
幽 窗 棋 罢 指 犹凉 。,By the darkening window the fingers are still cold after the game of Go. '
贾政 摇头 道 ： “ 也 未 见长 。 ”,Jia Zheng shook his head : ' Nothing very remarkable about that ! '
说 毕 ， 引 人 出来 。 方欲 走时 ， 忽 想起 一事 来 ， 问 贾珍 道 ： “ 这些 院落 屋宇 ， 并 几案 桌椅 都 算有 了 。,"With this remark he began to move on , but thought of something just as they were leaving , and stopped to ask Cousin Zhen : ' I see that the buildings in this garden have their proper complement of chairs and tables and so forth ."
还有 那些 帐幔 帘子 并 陈设 玩器 古董 ， 可 也 都 是 一处 一处 合式 配就 的 么 ？ ”,What about blinds and curtains and flower-vases and all that sort of thing ? Have they been selected to suit the individual rooms ? '
贾珍 回道 ： “ 那 陈设 的 东西 早已 添 了 许多 ， 自然 临期 合式 陈设 。,"' As regards ornaments , ' Cousin Zhen replied , ' we have already got in quite a large stock , and when the time comes we shall naturally select from it what is suitable for each individual room ."
帐幔 帘子 ， 昨日 听见 琏 兄弟 说 ， 还 不 全 ；,"As regards drapes and hangings , Cousin Lian told me yesterday that there are quite a lot yet to come ."
那 原是 一起 工程 之时 就 画 了 各处 的 图样 ， 量 准 尺寸 ， 就 打发 人 办去 的 ；,"What we did was to take the measurements from the plans drawn up for the carpenters and put the work in hand straight away , even before the buildings were finished ."
想必 昨日 得 了 一半 。 ”,"As far as I know , up to yesterday we had received about half of what was ordered . '"
贾政听 了 ， 便 知 此事 不是 贾珍 的 首尾 ， 便 叫 人 去 唤 贾琏 。,"From the way Cousin Zhen spoke , Jia Zheng gathered that this was not his responsibility and sent someone to summon Jia Lian ."
一时 来 了 。 贾政问 他 ： “ 共有 几宗 ？ 现今 得 了 几宗 ？ 尚 欠 几宗 ？ ”,"He arrived within moments , and Jia Zheng questioned him about the types and quantities ordered and the figures for what had already been received and what was still to come ."
贾琏 见 问 ， 忙 向 靴筒 内 取出 靴 掖 里 装 的 一个纸 折略 节来 ， 看 了 一看 ， 回 道 ： “ 妆蟒 洒 堆 、 刻丝 弹墨 ， 并 各色 绸 绫 大小 幔子 一百二十 架 ， 昨日 得 了 八十 架 ， 下欠 四十 架 。,"In response to his inquiry Jia Lian extracted a wallet from the leg of his boot , and glancing at a folded schedule inside it , summarized its contents as follows : ' Curtains , large and small , in various silks and satins - flowered , dragon-spot , sprigged , tapestry , panelled , ink-splash : one hundred and twenty . - Eighty of those were delivered yesterday . That leaves forty to come ."
帘子 二百 挂 ， 昨日 俱 得 了 。,- Blinds : two hundred . - Yes . They all arrived yesterday .
外 有 猩猩 毡帘 二百 挂 ， 湘妃竹 帘 一百 挂 ， 金丝 藤红 漆 竹帘 一百 挂 ， 黑漆 竹帘 一百 挂 ， 五彩 线络 盘 花帘 二百 挂 ： 每样 得 了 一半 ； 也 不过 秋天 都 全 了 。,"But then there are the special ones . - Blinds , scarlet felt : two hundred . Speckled bamboo : one hundred . Red lacquered bamboo with gold fleck : one hundred . Black lacquered bamboo : one hundred . Coloured net : two hundred . - We now have half of each of those four kinds . The other half is promised by the end of autumn ."
椅 搭 、 桌围 、 床裙 、 机套 ， 每 分 一千二百 件 ， 也 有 了 。 ”,"- Chair-covers , table-drapes , valances , tablecloths : one thousand two hundred of each . - Those we already have . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 走 ， 忽 见 青山 斜 阻 。,"They had been moving on as he spoke , but were presently brought to a halt by a steeply sloping hill which rose up in front of them ."
转过 山 怀中 ， 隐隐 露出 一带 黄泥 墙 ， 墙上 皆 用 稻茎 掩护 。,"Having negotiated its foot , they could see , almost concealed in a fold half-way up the other side of it , a dum-coloured adobe wall crowned with a coping of rice-straw thatch ."
有 几百 枝 杏花 ， 如 喷火 蒸霞 一般 。,"Inside it were several hundred apricot trees , whose flowering tops resembled the billowing rosy clouds of some vegetable volcano ."
里面 数 楹 茅屋 ， 外面 却是 桑 、 榆 、 槿 、 柘 ， 各色 树 稚新 条 ， 随其 曲折 ， 编 就 两溜 青篱 。,"In their midst stood a little group of reed-thatched cottages . Beyond the wall , with a barred gate dividing it in the middle , a loose hedge of irregular shape had been made by weaving together the pliant young shoots of the mulberry , elm , hibiscus , and silkworm thorn trees which grew outside it ."
篱外 山坡 之下 ， 有 一 土井 ， 旁 有 桔 槔 辘轳 之 属 ； 下面 分 畦 列 亩 ， 佳 蔬菜 花 ， 一望无际 。,"Between this hedge of trees and the lower slope of the hill was a rustic well , furnished with both well-sweep and windlass . Below the well , row upon row of miniature fields full of healthy-looking vegetables and flowers ran down in variegated strips to the bottom ."
贾政笑 道 ： “ 倒 是 此处 有些 道理 。,"' Ah , now here is a place with a purpose ! ' said Jia Zheng with a pleased smile ."
虽 系 人力 穿凿 ， 却 入 目 动心 ， 未免 勾 引起 我 归 农之意 。,"' It may have been made by human artifice , but the sight of it is none the less moving . In me it awakens the desire to get back to the land , to a life of rural simplicity ."
我们 且 进去 歇息 歇息 。 ”,Let us go in and rest a while ! '
说 毕 ， 方欲 进去 ， 忽见 篱 门外 路旁 有一 石 ， 亦 为 留题 之 所 ， 众人 笑 道 ： “ 更妙 ， 更妙 ！,They were just on the point of entering the gate in the hedge when they observed a stone at the side of the pathway leading up to it which had evidently been put there in order that the name of the place might be inscribed upon it . ' What a brilliant idea ! ' the literary gentlemen exclaimed .
此处 若 悬 匾 待题 ， 则 田舍 家风 一 洗 尽 矣 。 立此 一 碣 ， 又 觉 许多 生色 ， 非 范石湖 田家 之 咏 不足以 尽其 妙 。 ”,"' If they had put a board up over the gate , the rustic atmosphere would have been completely destroyed , whereas this stone actually enhances it . This is a place which calls for the bucolic talent of a Fan Chengda to do it justice ! '"
贾政道 ： “ 诸公 请题 。 ”,"' What shall we call it , then ? ' asked Jia Zheng ."
众人 云 ： “ 方才 世兄 云 ： ‘ 编新 不如 述 旧 。 ’,"' Just now our young friend was saying that to "" recall an old thing is better than to invent a new one "" , ' said one of the literary gentlemen ."
此处 古人 已道 尽 矣 ： 莫若 直 书 ‘ 杏花村 ’ 为 妙 。 ”,"' In this case the ancients have already provided the perfect name : "" Apricot Village "" . '"
,Jia Zheng knew that he was referring to the words of the fainting traveller in Du Mu 's poem :
,"' Where is the tavern ? ' I cry , and a lad points the way"
,To a village far off in the apricot trees .
贾政听 了 ， 笑 向贾珍 道 ： “ 正亏 提醒 了 我 。,He turned to Cousin Zhen with a smile : ' Yes . That reminds me .
此处 都 好 ， 只是 还 少 一个 酒幌 ， 明日 竟 做 一个 来 ， 就 依 外面 村庄 的 式样 ， 不必 华丽 ， 用 竹竿 挑 在 树梢 头 。 ”,There is just one thing missing here : an inn-sign . Tomorrow you must have one made . Nothing fancy . Just an ordinary inn-sign like the ones you see in country villages outside . And it should hang from a bamboo pole above the tree-tops . '
贾珍 答应 了 ， 又 回道 ： “ 此处 竟 不必 养 别样 雀鸟 ， 只 养 些 鹅 、 鸭 、 鸡 之类 ， 才 相称 。 ”,"Cousin Zhen promised to see this done and added a suggestion of his own : ' The birds here , too , ought to be ordinary farmyard ones - hens , ducks , geese , and so on - to be in keeping with the surroundings . '"
贾政 与 众人 都 说 ： “ 好 。 ”,Jia Zheng and the rest agreed enthusiastically .
贾政又 向 众人 道 ： “ ‘ 杏花村 ’ 固佳 ， 只是 犯 了 正村 名 ， 直待 请名 方可 。 ”,"' The only trouble with "" Apricot Village "" , ' said Jia Zheng , ' - though it would suit the place very well - is that it is the name of a real village ; so we should have to get official permission first before we could use it . '"
众客 都 道 ： “ 是 呀 ！,"' Ah , yes , ' said the others ."
如今 虚 的 ， 却是 何 字样 好 呢 ？ ”,' That means we still have to think of something for a temporary name . Now what shall it be ? '
大家 正 想 ， 宝玉 却 等 不得了 ， 也 不等 贾政 的话 ， 便 说道 ： “ 旧 诗云 ： ‘ 红杏 梢头 挂 酒旗 ’ 。,"While they were all still thinking , Bao-yu who had already had an idea , was so bursting with eagerness that he broke in , without waiting to be invited by his father : ' There is an old poem which has the lines Above the flowering apricot A hopeful inn-sign hangs ."
如今 莫若 且 题以 ‘ 杏帘 在 望 ’ 四 字 。 ”,"For the inscription on the stone we ought to have "" The Hopeful Sign "" . '"
众人 都 道 “ 好 个 ‘ 在 望 ’ ！,"' "" The Hopeful Sign "" , ' echoed the literary gentlemen admiringly . ' Very good !"
又 暗合 ‘ 杏花村 ’ 意思 。 ”,"The hidden allusion to "" Apricot Village "" is most ingenious ! '"
宝玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 村名 若 用 ‘ 杏花 ’ 二 字 ， 便 俗陋 不堪 了 。,"' Oh , as for the name of the village , ' said Bao-yu scornfully , ' "" Apricot Village "" is much too obvious !"
唐人 诗 里 ， 还有 ‘ 柴门 临 水稻 花香 ’ ， 何不 用 ‘ 稻香村 ’ 的 妙 ？ ”,"Why not "" Sweet-rice Village "" from the words of the old poem : A cottage by the water stands Where sweet the young rice smells ? '"
众人 听 了 ， 越发 同声 拍手 道 ： “ 妙 ！ ”,The literary gentlemen clapped their hands delightedly ;
贾政 一声 断喝 ： “ 无知 的 畜生 ！,but their cries of admiration were cut short by an angry shout from Jia Zheng : ' Ignorant young puppy ! '
你 能 知道 几个 古人 ， 能 记得 几首 旧诗 ， 敢 在 老先生 们 跟前 卖弄 ！,"Just how many "" old poets "" and "" old poems "" do you think you know , that you should presume to show off in front of your elders in this impertinent manner ?"
方才 任 你 胡说 ， 也 不过 试 你 的 清浊 ， 取笑 而已 ， 你 就 认真 了 ！ ”,We let you have your little say just now in order to test your intelligence . It was no more than a joke . Do you suppose we are seriously interested in your opinions ? '
说 着 ， 引 众人 步入 茆 堂 ， 里面 纸窗 木榻 ， 富贵 气象 一 洗 皆 尽 。,"They had been moving on meanwhile , and he now led them into the largest of the little thatched buildings , from whose simple interior with its paper windows and plain deal furniture all hint of urban refinement had been banished ."
贾政心 中 自是 欢喜 ， 却 瞅 宝玉 道 ： “ 此处 如何 ？ ”,"Jia Zheng was inwardly pleased . He stared hard at Bao-yu : ' How do you like this place , then ? '"
众人 见 问 ， 都 忙 悄悄的 推 宝玉 教 他 说好 。 宝玉 不 听 人言 ， 便 应声 道 ： “ 不及 ‘ 有凤来仪 ’ 多 了 。 ”,"With secret winks and nods the literary gentlemen urged Bao-yu to make a favourable reply , but he wilfully ignored their promptings . ' Not nearly as much as "" The Phoenix Dance "" . '"
贾政听 了道 ： “ 咳 ！,His father snorted disgustedly . ' Ignoramus !
无知 的 蠢物 ， 你 只 知 朱楼 画 栋 、 恶赖 富丽 为 佳 ， 那里 知道 这 清幽 气象 呢 ！,You have eyes only for painted halls and gaudy pavilions - the rubbishy trappings of wealth . What can you know of the beauty that lies in quietness and natural simplicity ?
— — 终是 不 读书 之 过 ！ ”,This is a consequence of your refusal to study properly . '
宝玉 忙 答道 ： “ 老爷 教训 的 固是 ， 但 古人云 ‘ 天然 ’ 二 字 ， 不知 何意 ？ ”,"' Your rebuke is , of course , justified , Father , ' Bao-yu replied promptly , ' but then I have never really understood what it was the ancients meant by "" natural "" . '"
众人 见 宝玉 牛心 ， 都 怕 他 讨 了 没趣 ； 今 见 问 “ 天然 ” 二 字 ， 众人 忙 道 ： “ 哥儿 别的 都 明白 ， 如何 ‘ 天然 ’ 反要 问 呢 ？,"The literary gentlemen , who had observed a vein of mulishness in Bao-yu which boded trouble , were surprised by the seeming naiveté of this reply . ' Why , fancy not knowing what "" natural "" means - you who have such a good understanding of so much else !"
‘ 天然 ’ 者 ， 天之 自成 ， 不是 人力 之 所为 的 。 ”,""" Natural "" is that which is of nature , that is to say , that which is produced by nature as opposed to that which is produced by human artifice . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 却 又 来 ！,"' There you are , you seel ' said Bao-yu ."
此 处置 一 田庄 ， 分明 是 人力 造作 成 的 ：,' A farm set down in the middle of a place like this is obviously the product of human artifice .
远 无 邻村 ， 近 不负 郭 ， 背山 无脉 ， 临水 无源 ， 高无隐 寺 之 塔 ， 下无 通市 之 桥 ， 峭然 孤出 ， 似非 大观 ， 那及 前 数处 有 自然 之 理 、 自然 之 趣 呢 ？,"There are no neighbouring villages , no distant prospects of city walls ; the mountain at the back does not belong to any system ; there is no pagoda rising from some tree-hid monastery in the hills above ; there is no bridge below leading to a near-by market town . It sticks up out of nowhere , in total isolation from everything else . It is not even a particularly remarkable view - not nearly so "" natural "" in either form or spirit as those other places we have seen ."
虽 种 竹引泉 ， 亦 不伤 穿凿 。,"The bamboos in those other places may have been planted by human hand and the streams diverted out of their natural courses , but there was no appearance of artifice ."
古人云 ‘ 天然 图画 ’ 四 字 ， 正 恐非 其地 而 强为 其地 ， 非其山 而 强为 其 山 ， 即 百般 精巧 ， 终不 相宜 … … ”,"That is why , when the ancients use the term "" natural "" I have my doubts about what they really meant . For example , when they speak of a "" natural painting "" , I can not help wondering if they are not referring to precisely that forcible interference with the landscape to which I object : putting hills where they are not meant to be , and that sort of thing . However great the skill with which this is done , the results are never quite ... '"
未及 说完 ， 贾 政气 的 喝命 ： “ 投出去 ！ ”,His discourse was cut short by an outburst of rage from Jia Zheng . ' Take that boy out of here ! '
才 出去 ， 又 喝 命 ： “ 回来 ！ ”,Bao-yu fled . ' Come back ! '
命 ： “ 再题 一联 ， 若 不通 ， 一并 打嘴巴 ！ ”,"He returned . ' You still have to make a couplet on this place . If it is not satisfactory , you will find yourself reciting it to the tune of a slapped face ! '"
宝玉 吓 的 战兢兢 的 ， 半日 ， 只得 念道 ：,Bao-yu stood quivering with fright and for some moments was unable to say anything . At last he recited the following couplet :
新绿 涨 添 浣 葛 处 ，,' Emergent buds swell where the washerwoman soaks her cloth .
好 云香护 采芹 人 。,A fresh tang rises where the cress-gatherer fills his pannier . '
贾政听 了 ， 摇头 道 ： “ 更 不好 。 ”,Jia Zheng shook his head : ' Worse and worse . '
一面 引 人 出来 ， 转过 山坡 ， 穿 花度 柳 ， 抚 石依泉 ， 过了荼 蘼架 ， 入 木香 棚 ， 越 牡丹亭 ， 度 芍药 圃 ， 到 蔷薇 院 ， 傍 芭蕉 坞 里 盘旋曲折 。 忽闻 水声 潺潺 ， 出于 石洞 ， 上则萝 薜 倒垂 ， 下 则 落花 浮荡 。,"He led them out of the ' village ' and round the foot of the hill : through flowers and foliage , by rock and rivulet , past rose-crowned pergolas and rose-twined trellises , through small pavilions embowered in peonies , where scent of sweet-briers stole , or pliant plantains waved - until they came to a place where a musical murmur of water issued from a cave in the rock . The cave was half-veiled by a green curtain of creeper , and the water below was starred with bobbing blossoms ."
众人 都 道 ： “ 好景 ， 好景 ！ ”,' What a delightful spot ! ' the literary gentlemen exclaimed .
贾政道 ： “ 诸公 题 以 何 名 ？ ”,"' Very well , gentlemen . What are you going to call it ? ' said Jia Zheng ."
,Inevitably the literary gentlemen thought of Tao Yuan-ming 's fisherman of Wu-ling and his Peach-blossom Stream .
众人 道 ： “ 再 不必 拟 了 ， 恰恰 乎 是 ‘ 武陵源 ’ 三 字 。 ”,"' "" The Wu-ling Stream "" , ' said one of them . ' The name is ready-made for this place . No need to look further than that . '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ 又 落实 了 ， — — 而且 陈旧 。 ”,"Jia Zheng laughed : ' The same trouble again , I am afraid . It is the name of a real place . In any case , it is too hackneyed . '"
众人 笑 道 ： “ 不然 就 用 ‘ 秦 人 旧舍 ’ 四 字 也罢 。 ”,"' All right , ' said the others good-humouredly . ' In that case simply call it "" Refuge of the Qins "" . '"
,Their minds still ran on the Peach-blossom Stream and its hidden paradise .
宝玉 道 ： “ 越发 背谬 了 。,' That is even more inappropriate ! ' said Bao-yu .
‘ 秦 人 旧舍 ’ 是 避乱 之 意 ， 如何 使得 ？,"' "" Refuge of the Qins "" would imply that the people here were fugitives from tyranny . How can we possibly call it that ?"
莫若 ‘ 蓼 汀花 淑 ’ 四 字 。 ”,"I suggest "" Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour "" . '"
贾政听 了道 ： “ 更是 胡说 。 ”,' Rubbish ! ' said Jia Zheng .
于是 贾政进 了 港洞 ， 又 问 贾珍 ： “ 有 船 无 船 ？ ”,He looked inside the grotto and asked Cousin Zhen if there were any boats .
贾珍 道 ： “ 采莲船 共 四只 ， 座 船 一只 ， 如今 尚未 造成 。 ”,"' Four punts for lotus-gathering and one for pleasure are on order , said Cousin Zhen , ' but they haven ' t finished making them yet . '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ 可惜 不得 入 了 ！ ”,' What a pity we can not go through ! ' said Jia Zheng .
贾珍 道 ： “ 从 山上 盘道 也 可以 进去 的 。 ” 说 毕 ， 在 前 导引 ， 大家 攀 藤抚树 过去 。,"' There is a very steep path over the top which would take us there , ' said Cousin Zhen , and proceeded to lead the way . The others scrambled up after him , clinging to creepers and leaning on tree-trunks as they went ."
只见 水上 落花 愈 多 ， 其 水 愈加 清溜 ， 溶溶 荡荡 ， 曲折 萦 纤 。,"When , having descended once more , they had regained the stream , it was wide and deep and distorted by many anfractuosities . The fallen blossoms seemed to be even more numerous and the waters on whose surface they floated even more limpid than they had been on the side they had just come from ."
池边 两行 垂柳 ， 杂 以 桃杏 遮天 ， 无 一些 尘土 。,The weeping willows which lined both banks were here and there diversified with peach and apricot trees whose interlacing branches made little worlds of stillness and serenity beneath them .
忽 见 柳阴 中 又 露出 一个 折带 朱 栏板 桥 来 ， 度过 桥 去 ， 诸 路可通 ， 便 见 一所 清凉 瓦舍 ， 一色 水磨 砖墙 ， 清瓦花 堵 。,"Suddenly , through the green of the willows , they glimpsed the scarlet balustrade of a wooden bridge whose sloping ramps led to a flat central span high above the water . When they had crossed it , they found a choice of paths leading to different parts of the garden . Ahead was an airy building with roofs of tile , whose elegant surrounding wall was of greyplastered brick pierced by ornamental grilles made of semicircular tiles laid together in openwork patterns ."
那大 主山 所分 之 脉 皆 穿墙 而 过 。,The wall was so constructed that outcrops of rock from the garden 's ' master mountain ' appeared to run through it in several places into the courtyard inside .
贾政道 ： “ 此处 这 一所 房子 ， 无味 的 很 。 ”,"' This building seems rather out of place here , ' said Jia Zheng ."
因而 步入 门 时 ， 忽 迎面 突出 插 天 的 大 玲珑 山石 来 ， 四面 群 绕 各式 石块 ， 竟 把 里面 所有 房屋 悉皆 遮住 。,"But as he entered the gate the source of his annoyance disappeared ; for a miniature mountain of rock , whose many holes and fissures , worn through it by weathering or the wash of waters , bestowed on it a misleading appearance of fragile delicacy , towered up in front of him and combined with the many smaller rocks of various shapes and sizes which surrounded it to efface from their view every vestige of the building they had just been looking at ."
且 一树 花木 也 无 ， 只见 许多 异草 ： 或有 牵 藤 的 ， 或有 引蔓 的 ， 或 垂 山岭 ， 或 穿 石脚 ， 甚至 垂檐 绕 柱 ， 萦 砌 盘 阶 ， 或如 翠带 飘摇 ， 或如 金绳蟠 屈 ， 或实 若 丹砂 ， 或 花 如 金桂 ， 味 香气 馥 ， 非凡 花之 可比 。,"Not a single tree grew in this enclosure , only plants and herbs : some aspired as vines , some crept humbly on the ground ; some grew down from the tops of rocks , some upwards from their feet ; some hung from the eaves in waving trails of green , some clung to pillars in circling bands of gold ; some had blood-red berries , some had golden flowers . And from every flower and every plant and every herb wafted the most exquisite and incomparable fragrances ."
贾政 不禁 道 ： “ 有趣 ！ 只是 不大 认识 。 ”,Jia Zheng could not help but admire : ' Charming ! But what are they all ? '
有 的 说 ： “ 是 薜荔 藤萝 。 ”,' Wild-fig ' and ' wistaria ' was all the literary gentlemen would venture .
贾政道 ： “ 薜荔 藤萝 那 得 有此 异香 ？ ”,"' But surely , ' Jia Zheng objected , ' wild-fig and wistaria do not have this delectable fragrance ? '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 果然 不是 。 这 众草 中 也 有 藤萝 薜荔 ， 那香 的 是 杜若蘅 芜 ， 那 一种 大约 是 茝 兰 ， 这 一种 大约 是 金葛 ， 那 一种 是 金 䔲 草 ， 这 一种 是 玉 蕗 藤 ， 红 的 自然 是 紫芸 ， 绿 的 定是 青芷 。,"' They certainly do not , ' said Bao-yu . ' There are wild-fig and wisteria among the plants growing here , but the ones with the fragrance are pollia and birthwort and - yes , I think those are orchids of some kind . That one over there is probably actinidia . The red flowers are , of course , rue , the "" herb of grace "" , and the green ones must be green-flag ."
想来 那 《 离骚 》 《 文选 》 所有 的 那些 异草 ： 有 叫作 什么 霍纳 姜汇 的 ， 也 有 叫作 什么 纶 组 紫绛 的 。 还有 什么 石帆 、 清松 、 扶留 等样 的 ， 见于 左太冲 《 吴都赋 》 。,"A lot of these rare plants are mentioned in Li sao and Wen zuan , particularly in the Poetical Descriptions of the Three Capitals by Zuo Si. For example , in his Description of the Wu Capital he has agastache , eulalia , and harsh-smelling ginger-bush , cord-flower , cable-flower , centaury and purplestrife , stone-sail and water-pine and sweet-scented eglantine ..."
又 有 叫作 什么 绿荑 的 ， 还有 什么 丹椒 、 蘼芜 、 风莲 ， 见于 《 蜀都 赋 》 。,"And then there are amaranth , xanthoxylon , anemone , phellopteron ... They come in the Description of the Shu Capital ."
如今 年 深 岁 改 ， 人 不能 识 ， 故 皆 象形 夺名 ， 渐渐 的 唤 差 了 ， 也 是 有 的 … … ”,"Of course , after all these centuries nobody really knows what all those names stand for . They apply them quite arbitrarily to whatever seem to fit the description , and gradually all of them - '"
未及 说完 ， 贾政喝 道 ： “ 谁 问 你 来 ？ ”,Once more an angry shout from his father cut him short : ' Who asked for your opinion ? '
唬 的 宝玉 倒退 ， 不敢 再说 。,Bao-yu shrank back and said no more .
贾政因 见 两边 俱 是 超手 游廊 ， 便 顺着 游廊 步入 ， 只见 上面 五间 清厦 ， 连着 卷棚 ， 四面 出廊 ， 绿窗 油壁 ， 更 比 前 清雅 不同 。,"Observing that there were balustraded loggias on either side of the court , Jia Zheng led his party through one of them towards the building at the rear . It was a cool , five-frame gallery with a low , roofed verandah running round it on all sides . The window-lattices were green and the walls freshly painted . It was a building of quite another order of elegance from the ones they had so far visited ."
贾政叹 道 ： “ 此 轩 中 煮茗 操琴 ， 也 不必 再 焚香 了 。,"' Anyone who sat sipping tea and playing the giz to himself on this verandah would have no need to burn incense if he wanted sweet smells for his inspiration , ' said Jia Zheng dreamily ."
此 造 却 出 意外 ， 诸公 必 有 佳作 新题 ， 以 颜其额 ， 方 不负 此 。 ”,' So unexpectedly beautiful a place calls for a specially beautiful name to adorn it . '
众人 笑 道 ： “ 莫若 ‘ 兰风蕙 露 ’ 贴切 了 。 ”,"' What could be better than "" Dewy Orchids "" ? ' said the literary gentlemen ."
贾政道 ： “ 也 只好 用 这 四 字 。,"' Yes , ' said Jia Zheng . ' That would do for the name ."
其 联云何 ？ ”,Now what about the couplet ? '
一 人 道 ： “ 我 想 了 一对 ， 大家 批削 改正 。 ”,"' I have thought of a couplet , ' said one of the gentlemen . ' Tell me all of you what you think of it :"
道 是 ：,
麝兰 芳霭 斜阳 院 ，,A musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard .
杜若香 飘 明月 洲 。,A sweet aroma of galingale floats over the moonlit island . '
众人 道 ： “ 妙 则 妙 矣 ！ 只是 ‘ 斜阳 ’ 二 字 不妥 。 ”,"' Not bad , ' said the others . ' But why "" sunset courtyard "" ? '"
那人 引 古诗 “ 靡 芜 满院 泣 斜阳 ” 句 ， 众人 云 ： “ 颓丧 ， 颓丧 ！ ”,"' I was thinking of that line in the old poem , ' said the man : ' The garden 's gillyflowers at sunset weep . After all , you have already got "" dewy "" in the name . I thought the "" sunset weeping "" would go with it rather well . ' ' Feeble ! Feeble ! ' cried the rest ."
又 一 人 道 ： “ 我 也 有 一联 ， 诸公 评阅 评阅 。 ”,"' I have thought of a couplet , too , ' said one of the others . ' Let me have your opinion of it :"
念道 ：,
三径 香风 飘玉蕙 ，,Down garden walks a fragrant breeze caresses beds of melilot .
一庭 明月照 金兰 。,By courtyard walls a brilliant moon illumines golden orchises . '
贾政 拈须 沉吟 ， 意欲 也 题 一联 ， 忽 抬头 见 宝玉 在 旁 不敢 作 声 ， 因 喝道 ： “ 怎么 你 应 说话 时 又 不 说 了 ！,"Jia Zheng stroked his beard , and his lips were observed to move as though he was on the point of proposing a couplet of his own . Suddenly , looking up , he caught sight of Bao-yu skulking behind the others , too scared to speak . ' What is the matter with you ? ' he bellowed at the unfortunate boy . ' You are ready enough with your opinions when they are not wanted ."
还要 等 人 请教 你 不成 ？ ”,Speak up ! - Or are you waiting for a written invitation ? '
宝玉 听 了 回道 ： “ 此处 并 没有 什么 ‘ 兰 麝 ’ 、 ‘ 明月 ’ ‘ 洲 渚 ’ 之类 ， 若 要 这样 着迹 说来 ， 就 题 二百 联 也 不能 完 。 ”,"' I can see no "" musk "" or "" moonlight "" or "" islands "" in this place , ' said Bao-yu . ' If we are to make couplets in this follow-my-leader fashion , we could turn out a couple of hundred of them and still have more to come . '"
贾政道 ： “ 谁 按着 你 的 头 ， 教 你 必定 说 这些 字样 呢 ？ ”,"' No one 's twisting your arm , ' said Jia Zheng . ' You do not have to use those words if you do not want to . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 如此 说 ， 则 匾 上 莫若 ‘ 蘅 芷 清芬 ’ 四 字 。 对联 则 是 ：,"' In that case , ' said Bao-yu , ' I suggest "" The Garden of Spices "" for the name ; and for the couplet :"
吟成 豆蔻 诗 犹艳 ，,"Composing amidst cardamoms , you shall make verses like flowers ."
睡足 荼 蘼 梦 亦 香 。,"Slumbering amidst the roses , you shall dream fragrant dreams . '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ 这 是 套 的 ‘ 书 成 蕉叶 文犹绿 ’ ， 不足为奇 。 ”,"' We all know where you got that from , ' said Jia Zheng : ' Composing muidst the plantains Green shall my verses be . We can not give you much credit for an imitation . '"
众人 道 ： “ 李太白 ‘ 凤凰台 ’ 之 作 ， 全套 ‘ 黄鹤楼 ’ 。 只要 套得 妙 。,"' Not at all ! ' said the literary gentlemen . ' There is nothing wrong with imitation provided it is done well . After all , Li Bo 's poem "" On Phoenix Terrace "" is entirely based on Cui Hao 's "" Yellow Crane Tower "" , yet it is a much better poem ."
如今 细评 起来 ， 方才 这一 联竟 比 ‘ 书 成 蕉叶 ’ 尤觉 幽雅 活动 。 ”,On reflection our young friend 's couplet seems more poetical and imaginative than the original . '
贾政笑 道 ： “ 岂有此理 ！ ”,"' Oh , come now ! ' said Jia Zheng . But they could see he was not displeased ."
说 着 ， 大家 出来 ， 走 不多 远 ， 则 见 崇 阁 巍峨 ， 层楼 高 起 ， 面面 琳宫 合抱 ， 迢迢 复道 萦 纤 。,"Leaving the place of many fragrances behind them , they had not advanced much further when they could see ahead of them a building of great magnificence which Jia Zheng at once identified as the main reception hall of the Residence . Roof above roof soared , Eye up-compelling , Of richly-wrought chambers And high winding galleries ."
青松 拂 檐 ， 玉兰 绕 砌 ； 金辉 兽面 ， 彩 焕 螭 头 。,"Green rafts of dark pine Brushed the eaves ' edges . Milky magnolias Bordered the buildings . Gold-glinting cal-faces , Rainbow-hued serpents ' snouts Peered out or snarled down From cornice and finial ."
贾政道 ： “ 这 是 正殿 了 。 — — 只是 太 富丽 了 些 ！ ”,"' It is rather a showy building , ' said Jia Zheng ."
众人 都 道 ： “ 要 如此 方是 。 虽然 贵妃 崇尚 节俭 ， 然 今日 之 尊 ， 礼仪 如此 ， 不为过 也 。 ”,"But the literary gentlemen reassured him : ' Although Her Grace is a person of simple and abstemious tastes , the exalted position she now occupies makes it only right and proper that there should be a certain amount of pomp in her reception . This building is in no way excessive . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 走 ， 只见 正面 现出 一座 玉石 牌坊 ， 上面 龙 蟠螭 护 ， 玲珑 凿 就 。,"Still advancing in the same direction , they presently found themselves at the foot of the white marble memorial arch which framed the approach to the hall . The pattern of writhing dragons protectively crouched over its uppermost horizontal was so pierced and fretted by the sculptor 's artistry as to resemble lacework rather than solid stone ."
贾政道 ： “ 此处 书 以 何文 ？ ”,' What inscription do we want on this arch ? ' Jia Zheng inquired .
众人 道 ： “ 必 是 ‘ 蓬莱仙境 ’ 方妙 。 ”,"' "" Peng-lai 's Fairy Precincts "" is the only name that would do it justice , ' said the literary gentlemen ."
贾政 摇头 不语 。,Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing .
宝玉 见 了 这个 所在 ， 心中 忽 有所 动 ， 寻思 起来 ， 倒象 在 那里 见 过 的 一般 ， 却 一时 想不起 那年 那日 的 事 了 。,"The sight of this building and its arch had inspired a strange and unaccountable stir of emotion in Bao-yu which on reflection he interpreted as a sign that he must have known a building somewhat like this before - though where or when he could not for the life of him remember . He was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded him of , when Jia"
贾政又 命 他 题咏 。 宝玉 只顾 细思 前景 ， 全 无心 于 此 了 。,"Zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch , and he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composition ."
众人 不知 其意 ， 只当 他 受 了 这 半日 折磨 ， 精神 耗散 ， 才 尽 词穷 了 ； 再 要 牛 难 逼迫 着 了 急 ， 或 生出 事来 ， 倒 不便 。,"The literary gentlemen , not knowing the nature of his preoccupation , supposed that his father 's incessant bullying had worn him out and that he had finally come to the end of his inspiration . They feared that further bullying might once more bring out the mulish streak in him , thereby provoking an explosion which would be distasteful for everybody ."
遂 忙 都 劝 贾政道 ： “ 罢了 ， 明日 再题 罢了 。 ”,Accordingly they urged Jia Zheng to allow him a day 's grace in which to produce something suitable .
贾政心 中 也 怕 贾母 不 放心 ， 遂 冷笑 道 ： “ 你 这 畜生 ， 也 竟 有 不能 之时 了 。,"Jia Zheng , who was secretly beginning to be apprehensive about the possible consequences of Grandmother Jia 's anxiety for her darling grandson , yielded , albeit with a bad grace : ' Jackanapes ! So even you have your off moments it seems ."
— — 也罢 ， 限 你 一日 ， 明日 题 不 来 ， 定 不 饶 你 。,"Well , I will give you a day to do it in . But woe betide you if you can not produce something tomorrow !"
这 是 第一 要紧 处所 ， 要 好生 作来 ！ ”,"And it had better be something good , too , because this is the most important building in the garden . '"
说 着 ， 引 人 出来 ， 再 一 观望 ， 原来 自 进门 至此 ， 才 游 了 十之 五六 。,"After they had seen over the building and come out again , they stopped for a while on the terrace to look at a general view of the whole garden and attempted to make out the places they had already visited . They were surprised to find that even now they had covered little more than half of the whole area ."
又 值 人 来回 ， 有 雨 村 处 遣 人 回话 。,Just at that moment a servant came up to report that someone had arrived with a message from Yu-cun .
贾政笑 道 ： “ 此 数处 不能 游 了 。,"' I can see that we shall not be able to finish today , ' said Jia Zheng ."
虽 如此 ， 到底 从 那 一边 出去 ， 也 可略 观 大概 。 ”,"' However , if we go out by the way I said , we should at least be able to get some idea of the general layout . '"
说 着 ， 引客 行来 ， 至 一 大桥 ， 水 如晶 帘 一般 奔入 ， 原来 这 桥边 是 通外 河 之 闸 ， 引泉 而 入者 。,He conducted them to a large bridge above a crystal curtain of rushing water . It was the weir through which the water from the little river which fed all the pools and watercourses of the garden ran into it from outside .
贾政因 问 ： “ 此 闸 何名 ？ ”,Jia Zheng invited them to name it .
宝玉 道 ： “ 此 乃 沁芳源之正流 ， 即 名 ‘ 沁 芳 闸 ’ 。 ”,"' This is the source of the "" Drenched Blossoms "" stream we looked at earlier on , ' said Bao-yu . ' We should call it "" Drenched Blossoms Weir "" . '"
贾政道 ： “ 胡说 ， 偏 不用 ‘ 沁 芳 ’ 二 字 。 ”,"' Rubbish ! ' said Jia Zheng . ' You may as well forget about your "" Drenched Blossoms "" , because we are not going to use that name ! '"
于是 一路行 来 ， 或 清堂 ， 或 茅舍 ， 或 堆石 为 垣 ， 或 编花 为 门 ， 或 山下 得 幽 尼 佛寺 ， 或 林中 藏 女道 丹房 ， 或 长廊 曲洞 ， 或 方厦 圆 亭 ： 贾政皆 不及 进去 。,"Their progress continued past many unexplored features of the garden , viz : a summer lodge a straw-thatched cot a dry-stone wall a flowering arch a tiny temple nestling beneath a hill a nun 's retreat hidden in a little wood a straight gallery a crooked cave a square pavilion and a round belvedere . But Jia Zheng hurried past every one of them without entering ."
因 半日 未尝 歇息 ， 腿酸 脚 软 ， 忽 又 见 前面 露出 一所 院落 来 ， 贾政道 ： “ 到此 可要 歇息 歇息 了 。 ” 说 着 一径 引入 ， 绕 着 碧 桃花 ， 穿过 竹篱 花障 编就 的 月洞门 ， 俄 见 粉垣 环护 ， 绿柳 周垂 。,"However , he had now been walking for a very long time without a rest and was beginning to feel somewhat footsore ; and so , when the next building appeared through the trees ahead , he proposed that they should go in and sit down , and led his party towards it by the quickest route possible . They had to walk round a stand of double-flowering ornamental peach-trees and through a circular opening in a flower-covered bamboo trellis . This brought them in sight of the building 's whitewashed enclosing wall and the contrasting green of the weeping willows which surrounded it ."
贾政 与 众人 进 了 门 ， 两边 尽 是 游廊 相接 ， 院中 点 衬 几块 山石 ， 一边 种 几本 芭蕉 ， 那 一边 是 一 树 西府 海棠 ， 其 势 若 伞 ， 丝 垂金缕 ， 葩 吐 丹砂 。,"A roofed gallery ran from each side of the gate round the inner wall of the forecourt , in which a few rocks were scattered . On one side of it some green plantains were growing and on the other a weeping variety of Szechwan crab , whose pendant clusters of double-flowering carmine blossoms hung by stems as delicate as golden wires on the umbrella-shaped canopy of its boughs ."
众人 都 道 ： “ 好 花 ， 好 花 ！,' What magnificent blossom ! ' exclaimed the literary gentlemen .
海棠 也 有 ， 从没 见 过 这样 好 的 。 ”,"' One has seen plenty of crab-apple blossom before , but never anything as beautiful as this . '"
贾政道 ： “ 这 叫做 ‘ 女儿 棠 ’ ， 乃是 外国 之种 ， 俗 传出 ‘ 女儿国 ’ ， 故花 最 繁盛 ， — — 亦 荒唐 不经之说 耳 。 ”,"' This kind is called "" maiden crab "" , ' said Jia Zheng . ' It comes from abroad . According to vulgar belief it originally came from the Land of Maidens , and that is supposed to be the reason why it blooms so profusely . Needless to say , it is only the ignorant sort of persons who hold this ridiculous belief . '"
众人 道 ： “ 毕竟 此 花 不同 ， ‘ 女国 ’ 之 说 ， 想 亦 有 之 。 ”,"' It certainly has most unusual blossoms , ' said the literary gentlemen . ' ' Who knows , perhaps there is something in the popular belief ."
宝玉 云 ： “ 大约 骚人 咏士 以此 花红 若 施脂 ， 弱 如 扶病 ， 近乎 闺阁 风度 ， 故以 ‘ 女儿 ’ 命名 。 世人 以讹传讹 ， 都 未免 认真 了 。 ”,"' Surely , ' said Bao-yu , ' it is much more probable that poets and painters gave it the name of "" maiden crab "" because of its rouge-like colour and delicate , drooping shape , and that the name was misunderstood by ignorant , literal-minded people , who made up this silly story to account for it . '"
众人 都 说 ： “ 领教 ！ 妙 解 ！ ”,' That must be it ! ' said the literary gentlemen . ' Most grateful for the explanation ! '
一面 说话 ， 一面 都 在 廊 下榻 上 坐 了 。,While they were speaking they were at the same time arranging themselves on some benches in the gallery .
贾政因 道 ： “ 想 几个 什么 新鲜 字 来题 ？ ”,' Has anyone an original idea for a name ? ' said Jia Zheng when they were all seated .
一 客道 ： “ ‘ 蕉 鹤 ’ 二 字 妙 。 ”,One of them proposed ' Cranes in the Plantains ' .
又 一个 道 ： “ ‘ 崇光 泛 彩 ’ 方妙 。 ”,Another suggested ' Shimmering Splendour ' .
贾政 与 众人 都 道 ： “ 好 个 ‘ 崇光 泛 彩 ’ ！ ”,"' "" Shimmering Splendour "" , ' Jia Zheng and the others repeated , trying out the words ."
宝玉 也 道 ： “ 妙 。 ”,' That is good ! A lovely name ! ' said Bao-yu .
又 说 ： “ 只是 可惜 了 ！ ”,"But a moment later he added : ' Rather a pity , though . '"
众人 问 ： “ 如何 可惜 ？ ”,"' Why "" rather a pity "" ? ' they asked ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 此处 蕉棠 两 植 ， 其意 暗蓄 ’ 红 ‘ ‘ 绿 ’ 二 字 在内 ， 若 说 一样 ， 遗漏 一样 ， 便 不足取 。 ”,"' Well , said Bao-yu , ' there are both plantains and crab-apple blossom in this courtyard . Whoever planted them must have been thinking of "" the red and the green "" . If our name mentions only one and leaves out the other , it will seem somehow inadequate . '"
贾政道 ： “ 依 你 如何 ？ ”,"' What do you suggest , then ? ' said Jia Zheng ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 依 我 ， 题 ‘ 红香绿 玉 ’ 四 字 ， 方 两全其美 。 ”,"' I suggest "" Fragrant Red and Lucent Green "" , said Bao-yu . ' That takes account of both of them . '"
贾政 摇头 道 ： “ 不好 ， 不好 ！ ”,"Jia Zheng shook his head : ' No , that is no good ! '"
说 着 ， 引 人 进入 房内 。,He led them inside the building .
只见 其中 收拾 的 与 别处 不同 ， 竟 分不出 间隔 来 。,"Its interior turned out to be all corridors and alcoves and galleries , so that properly speaking it could hardly have been said to have rooms at all ."
原来 四面 皆 是 雕空 玲珑 木板 ， 或 “ 流云 百蝠 ” ， 或 “ 岁寒三友 ” ， 或 山水 人物 ， 或 翎毛 花卉 ， 或 集锦 ， 或 博古 ， 或 万福 万寿 ， 各种 花样 ， 皆 是 名手 雕镂 ， 五彩 销金 嵌 玉 的 。,"The partition walls which made these divisions were of wooden panelling exquisitely carved in a wide variety of motifs : bats in clouds , the ' three friends of winter ' - pine , plum and bamboo , little figures in landscapes , birds and flowers , scrollwork , antique bronze shapes , ' good luck ' and ' long life ' characters , and many others . The carvings , all of them the work of master craftsmen , were beautified with inlays of gold , mother-o ' - pearl and semi-precious stones ."
一槅一 槅 ， 或 贮书 ， 或 设鼎 ， 或 安置 笔砚 ， 或 供设 瓶花 ， 或 安放 盆景 ； 其 槅 式样 ， 或 圆 ， 或方 ， 或 葵花 蕉叶 ， 或 连环 半璧 ： 真是 花团锦簇 ， 剔透玲珑 。,"In addition to being panelled , the partitions were pierced by numerous apertures , some round , some square , some sunflower-shaped , some shaped like a fleur-de-lis , some cusped , some fan-shaped . Shelving was concealed in the double thickness of the partition at the base of these apertures , making it possible to use them for storing books and writing materials and for the display of antique bronzes , vases of flowers , miniature tray-gardens and the like . The overall effect was at once richly colourful and , because of the many apertures , airy and graceful ."
倏尔 五色 纱糊 ， 竟 系 小窗 ； 倏尔 彩 绫轻 覆 ， 竟 系 幽户 。,"The trompe-l ' œil effect of these ingenious partitions had been further enhanced by inserting false windows and doors in them , the former covered in various pastel shades of gauze , the latter hung with richly-patterned damask portiéres ."
且 满 墙 皆 是 随 依 古董 玩器 之 形 抠 成 的 槽子 ， 如 琴 、 剑 、 悬瓶 之类 ， 俱 悬于 壁 ， 却 都 是 与 壁 相平 的 。,"The main walls were pierced with window-like perforations in the shape of zithers , swords , vases and other objects of virth ."
众人 都 赞 ： “ 好 精致 ！ 难 为 怎么 做 的 ！ ”,The literary gentlemen were rapturous : ' Exquisite ! ' they cried . ' What marvellous workmanship ! '
原来 贾政 走进 来 了 ， 未 到 两层 ， 便 都 迷 了 旧路 ， 左 瞧 也 有 门 可通 ， 右 瞧 也 有 窗 隔断 ， 及 到 跟前 ， 又 被 一架 书 挡住 ， 回头 又 有 窗纱 明透 门径 。 及至 门前 ， 忽 见 迎面 也 进来 了 一起 人 ， 与 自己 的 形相 一样 ， — — 却是 一架 大 玻璃镜 。,"Jia Zheng , after taking no more than a couple of turns inside this confusing interior , was already lost . To the left of him was what appeared to be a door . To the right was a wall with a window in it . But on raising its portiére he discovered the door to be a bookcase ; and when , looking back , he observed - what he had not noticed before - that the light coming in through the silk gauze of the window illuminated a passage-way leading to an open doorway , and began walking towards it , a party of gentlemen similar to his own came advancing to meet him , and he realized that he was walking towards a large mirror ."
转过 镜 去 ， 一发 见门多 了 。,"They were able to circumvent the mirror , but only to find an even more bewildering choice of doorways on the other side ."
贾珍笑 道 ： “ 老爷 随 我 来 ， 从 这里 出去 就是 后院 ， 出 了 后院 倒 比先 近 了 。 ”,' Come ! ' said Cousin Zhen with a laugh . ' Let me show you the way ! If we go out here we shall be in the back courtyard . We can reach the gate of the garden much more easily from the back courtyard than from the front . '
引着 贾政 及 众人 转 了 两层 纱 厨 ， 果得 一门 出去 ， 院中 满 架 蔷薇 。,"He led them round the gauze hangings of a summer-bed , then through a door into a garden full of rambler roses ."
转过 花障 ， 只见 青溪 前 阻 。,Behind the rose-trellis was a stream running between green banks .
众人 咤 异 ： “ 这 水 又 从何而来 ？ ”,The literary gentlemen were intrigued to know where the water came from .
贾珍 遥指 道 ： “ 原 从 那 闸 起流 至 那 洞口 ， 从 东北 山凹 里 引到 那 村庄 里 ， 又 开 一道 岔口 ， 引至 西南 上 ， 共总 流 到 这里 ， 仍旧 合 在 一处 ， 从 那 墙下 出去 。 ”,Cousin Zhen pointed in the direction of the weir they had visited earlier :
众人 听 了 ， 都 道 ： “ 神妙 之 极 ！ ”,"' The water comes in over that weir , then through the grotto , then under the lea of the north-east "" mountain "" to the little farm . There a channel is led off it which runs into the south-east corner of the garden . Then it runs round and rejoins the main stream here . And from here the water flows out again underneath that wall '"
说 着 ， 忽 见 大山 阻路 ， 众人 都 迷了路 ， 贾珍笑 道 ： “ 跟我来 。 ”,' How very ingenious ! '
乃 在 前 导引 ， 众人 随着 ， 由 山脚下 一 转 ， 便是 平坦 大路 ， 豁然 大门 现于 面前 ， 众人 都 道 ： “ 有趣 ， 有趣 ！ 搜神夺巧 ， 至于 此 极 ！ ”,"They moved on again , but soon found themselves at the foot of a tall ' mountain ' . ' Follow me ! ' said Cousin Zhen , amused at the bewilderment of the others , who were now completely at sea as to their whereabouts . He led them round the foot of the ' mountain ' - and there , miraculously , was a broad , flat path and the gate by which they had entered , rising majestically in front of them . ' Well ! ' exclaimed the literary gentlemen . ' This beats everything ! The skill with which this has all been designed is quite out of this world ! '"
于是 大家 出来 。,Whereupon they all went out of the garden .
那宝玉 一心 只 记挂着 里边 姊妹 们 ， 又 不见 贾政 吩咐 ， 只得 跟 到 书房 。,"Bao-yu was now longing to get back to the girls , but as no dismissal was forthcoming from his father , he followed him along with the others into his study ."
贾政 忽 想 起来 道 ： “ 你 还 不 去 ， 看 老太太 惦记 你 。,"Fortunately Jia Zheng suddenly recollected that Bao-yu was still with him : ' Well , run along then ! Your grandmother will be worrying about you ."
难道 还 逛 不足 么 ？ ”,I take it you are not still waiting for more ? '
宝玉 方 退 了 出来 。,At last Bao-yu could withdraw .
至 院外 ， 就 有 跟 贾政 的 小厮 上来 抱住 ， 说道 ： “ 今日 亏了 老爷 喜欢 ， 方才 老太太 打发 人 出来 问 了 几遍 ， 我们 回说 老爷 喜欢 ； 要不然 ， 老太太 叫 你 进去 了 ， 就 不得 展才 了 。,"But as soon as he was in the courtyard outside , he was waylaid by a group of Jia Zheng 's pages who laid hands on him and prevented him from going . ' You have done well today , haven ' t you , coming out top with all those poems ? You have us to thank for that ! Her Old Ladyship sent round several times asking about you , but because the Master was so pleased with you , we told her not to worry . If we had not done that , you would not have had the chance to show oft your poems !"
人人 都 说 你 才 那些 诗 比 众人 都 强 ， 今儿 得 了 彩头 ， 该 赏 我们 了 。 ”,Everyone says they were better than all the others . What about sharing your good luck with us ? '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 每人 一 吊 。 ”,Bao-yu laughed good-naturedly . ' All right . A string of cash each . '
众人 道 ： “ 谁 没见 那一 吊 钱 ！,' Who wants a measly string of cash ?
把 这 荷包 赏 了 罢 。 ”,Give us that little purse you are wearing ! '
说 着 ， 一个个 都 上来 解 荷包 ， 解 扇袋 ， 不容分说 ， 将 宝玉 所佩 之 物 ， 尽行 解去 。,"And without a ' by your leave ' they began to despoil him , beginning with the purse and his fancase , of all his trinkets , until every one of the objects he carried about him had been taken from him ."
又 道 ： “ 好生 送上去 罢 。 ”,"' Now , they said , ' we will see you back in style ! '"
一个个 围绕 着 ， 送 至 贾母 门前 。,"And closing round him , they marched him back to Grandmother Jia 's apartment in triumphal procession ."
那时 贾母正 等 着 他 ， 见 他 来 了 ， 知道 不曾 难 为 他 ， 心中 自 是 喜欢 。,"Grandmother Jia had been waiting for him with some anxiety , and was naturally delighted to see him come in apparently none the worse for his experience ."
少时 袭 人 倒 了 茶 来 ， 见 身边 佩物 ， 一件 不 存 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 带 的 东西 必 又 是 那 起 没脸 的 东西 们 解 了 去 了 。 ”,"Soon after , when he was back in his own room , Aroma came in to pour him some tea and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had disappeared . ' Where have the things from your belt gone ? ' she said . ' I suppose those worthless pages have taken them again . '"
黛玉 听说 ， 走 过来 一 瞧 ， 果然 一件 没有 ， 因 向宝玉 道 ： “ 我 给 你 的 那个 荷包 也 给 他们 了 ？,"Dai-yu overheard her and came up to inspect . Sure enough , not one of the things was there . ' So you have given away that little purse I gave you ?"
你 明儿 再 想 我 的 东西 ， 可不 能够 了 ！ ”,"Very well , then . You need not expect me to give you anything in future , however much you want it ! '"
说 毕 ， 生气 回房 ， 将 前日 宝玉 嘱咐 他 没 做 完 的 香袋 儿 ， 拿 起 剪子 来 就 铰 。,"With these words she went off to her own room in a temper , and taking up a still unfinished perfume sachet which she was making for him at his own request , she began to cut it up with her embroidery scissors ."
宝玉 见 他 生气 ， 便 忙 赶过来 ， — — 早已 剪破 了 。,"Bao-yu , observing that she was angry , had hurried after her - but it was too late . The sachet was already cut to pieces ."
宝玉 曾 见 过 这 香袋 ， 虽 未 完工 ， 却 十分 精巧 ， 无故 剪 了 ， 却 也 可气 。,"Although it had not been finished , Bao-yu could see that the embroidery was very fine , and it made him angry to think of the hours and hours of work so wantonly destroyed ."
因 忙 把 衣领 解 了 ， 从 里面 衣襟 上将 所系 荷包 解 下来 了 ， 递 与 黛玉 道 ： “ 你 瞧瞧 ， 这 是 什么 东西 ？,Tearing open his collar he took out the little embroidered purse which had all along been hanging round his neck and held it out for her to see . ' Look ! What is that ?
我何 从 把 你 的 东西 给 人 来 着 ？ ”,When have I ever given anything of yours to someone else ? '
黛玉 见 他 如此 珍重 ， 带 在 里面 ， 可知 是 怕人 拿去 之 意 ， 因此 自悔 莽撞 剪 了 香袋 ， 低着头 一言不发 。,Dai-yu knew that he must have treasured her gift to have worn it inside his clothing where there was no risk of its being taken from him . She regretted her over-hasty destruction of the sachet and hung her head in silence .
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 也 不用 铰 ， 我 知 你 是 懒怠 给 我 东西 。,"' You need not have cut it up , ' said Bao-yu . ' I know it is only because you hate giving things away ."
我 连 这 荷包 奉还 ， 何如 ？ ”,"Here , you can have this back too since you are so stingy ! '"
说 着 掷 向 他 怀中 而 去 。,He tossed the purse into her lap and turned to go .
黛玉 越发 气 的 哭 了 ， 拿 起 荷包 又 铰 。,"Dai-yu burst into tears of rage , and picking up the little purse , attacked that too with her scissors ."
宝玉 忙 回身 抢住 ， 笑 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 饶 了 他 罢 ！ ”,"Bao-yu hurried back and caught her by the wrist . ' Come , cuzzy dear ! ' he said with a laugh . ' Have mercy on it ! '"
黛玉 将 剪子 一 摔 ， 拭泪 说道 ： “ 你 不用 合 我 好 一阵 、 歹 一阵 的 ， 要 恼 就 摆开 手 。 ”,"Dai-yu threw down the scissors and wiped her streaming eyes . ' You should not blow hot and cold by turns . If you want to quarrel , let's quarrel properly and have nothing to do with each other ! '"
说 着 赌气 上床 ， 面向 里 倒下 拭泪 。,"She got up on the kang in a great huff , and turning her back on him , sobbed into her handkerchief and affected to ignore his presence ."
禁不住 宝玉 上来 “ 妹妹 ” 长 “ 妹妹 ” 短 赔不是 。,"But Bao-yu got up beside her , and with many soothing words and affectionate endearments humbly entreated her forgiveness ."
前面 贾母 一片 声 找 宝玉 。,Meanwhile in the front room Grandmother Jia was calling loudly for her beloved grandson .
众人 回说 ： “ 在 林姑娘房 里 。 ”,"' Master Bao is in the back with Miss Lin , ' they told her ."
贾母 听 说道 ： “ 好 ， 好 ！ 让 他 姐妹 们 一处 玩玩儿 罢 。,"' Ah , good ! ' said the old lady . ' Let us leave them alone together , then ."
才 他 老子 拘 了 他 这 半天 ， 让 他 松泛 一会 子 罢 。 — — 只别 叫 他们 拌嘴 。 ”,It will be a nice relaxation for him after the strain of being so long with his father - as long as they do not argue . '
众人 答应 着 。,"' Yes , milady . '"
黛玉 被 宝玉 缠 不过 ， 只得 起来 道 ： “ 你 的 意思 不 叫 我 安生 ， 我 就 离 了 你 。 ”,"Finding herself unable to shake oft Bao-yu 's attentions , Dai-yu got up from the kang : ' I can see you are determined not to let me live in peace . I shall just have to go elsewhere ."
说 着 往外 就 走 。,And off she went .
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 到 那里 我 跟到 那里 。 ”,"' Wherever you go , I shall go with you , ' said Bao-yu , taking up the purse and beginning to fasten it on again ."
一面 仍 拿 着 荷包 来 带上 。,But Dai-yu snatched it away from him .
黛玉 伸手 抢道 ： “ 你 说 不要 ， 这 会子 又 带上 ， 我 也 替 你 怪臊 的 ！ ”,"' First you say you do not want it , and now you are trying to put it on again . You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! '"
说 着 “ 嗤 ” 的 一声 笑 了 。,Her anger dissolved in a little explosion of laughter .
宝玉 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 明儿 另 替 我 做 个 香袋 儿 罢 ！ ”,' Dearest cuzzy ! ' said Bao-yu . ' ' Will not you please make me another sachet ? '
黛玉 道 ： “ 那 也 瞧 我 的 高兴 罢了 。 ”,"' That depends on whether I feel in the mood or not , ' said Dai-yu ."
一面 说 ， 一面 二人 出房 ， 到 王夫人 上 房中 去 了 。,Chatting together they went out of the room and round to Lady Wang 's apartment .
可巧 宝钗 也 在 那里 。,Bao-chai was there already .
此时 王夫人 那边 热闹 非常 。 原来 贾蔷已 从 姑苏 采买 了 十二个 女孩子 、 并聘 了 教习 以及 行头 等 事 来 了 。,"They found everyone there in a state of great excitement owing to the fact that Jia Qiang had just arrived back from Soochow with the twelve childactresses he had purchased there , together with their instructors and all the costumes and properties they would use in performing their plays ."
那时 薛姨妈 另 于 东北 上 一所 幽静 房舍 居住 ， 将 梨 香院 另行 修理 了 ， 就 令 教习 在 此 教演 女戏 ； 又 另 派 了 家中 旧 曾 学 过 歌唱 的 众女 人们 ， — — 如今 皆 是 皤 然 老妪 — — 着 他们 带领 管理 。,"Aunt Xue had now moved to a quiet , secluded apartment in the north-east corner of the mansion , and Pear-tree Court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges . A number of female members of the Rong-guo staff who had some previous training in singing and acting - they were all grey-haired old women by now - were put in charge of the domestic arrangements ."
其 日月 出入 银钱 等 事 ， 以及 诸凡 大小 所需 之 物料 账目 ， 就 令 贾蔷 总理 。,"Pay and expenses and the provision of whatever was needed for the maintenance of the troupe was to remain in the hands of Jia Qiang , who was also to keep the accounts ."
又 有 林之孝 来回 ： “ 采访 聘 买 得 十二个 小 尼姑 、 小 道姑 ， 都 到 了 ； 连新 做 的 二十 ｛ 四 ｝ 分 道袍 也 有 了 。,"Simultaneously with this arrival , Lin Zhi-xiao 's wife had come to announce that the selection and purchase of twenty-four little nuns - twelve Buddhist and twelve Taoist - had been successfully accomplished . Even the twenty-four little habits they would wear had now arrived brand-new from the tailor ."
外 又 有 一个 带发修行 的 ， 本 是 苏州 人氏 ， 祖上 也 是 读书 仕宦 之 家 ， 因 自幼 多 病 ， 买 了 许多 替身 ， 皆 不中用 ， 到底 这 姑娘 入 了 空门 ， 方才 好 了 ， 所以 带发修行 。,"But that was not all . It appeared that a young lady who had entered the church under half vows as an ' unshaved nun ' might be persuaded to join them . ' She comes of a highly educated official family from Soochow , ' Lin Zhi-xiao 's wife told them . ' As a child she was always ailing and her parents paid for any number of "" proxy novices "" in the hope that she would get better ; but all was of no avail . In the end there was nothing for it but for the young lady to take the great step herself - though as a lay sister , without the shaving of hair . And sure enough her illness got better immediately ."
今年 十八岁 ， 取名 妙玉 。,"She is now eighteen years of age . Her name in religion is "" Adamantina "" ."
如今 父母 俱 已 亡故 ， 身边 只有 两个 老嬷嬷 、 一个 小丫头 伏侍 ， 文墨 也 极通 ， 经典 也 极熟 ， 模样 又 极好 。,"She lost both her parents some time ago and has only two old nurses and a little maid to look after her . She is said to be a great clerk and knows all the classics by heart . What is more , she is a very handsome young woman ."
因 听说 ‘ 长安 ’ 都 中 有 观音 遗迹 ， 并 贝叶 遗文 ， 去年 随了 师父 上来 ， 现在 西 门外 牟尼院 住 着 。,She moved into this area with her teacher a year ago because of some relic of Guanyin she had heard about and because there are some old Sanskrit texts here that she wanted to look at . She has been living ever since in the Sakyamuni Convent outside the west gate .
他 师父 精演 先 天神 数 ， 于 去冬 圆寂 了 。,"Her teacher was a great authority on the "" Primordial "" branch of the Tantra . She died last winter ."
遗言 说 他 ： ‘ 不宜 回乡 ， 在 此 静候 ， 自有 结果 。 ’,"As she lay dying she told Adamantina that she was not to go back home , but to wait here quietly for a call ."
所以 未曾 扶灵 回去 。 ”,That is why she stays on here and has never taken her teacher 's coffin back . '
王夫人 便 道 ： “ 这样 我们 何不 接 了 他 来 ？ ”,"' We should certainly take advantage of this to invite her here , ' said Lady Wang ."
林之孝 家 的 回道 ： “ 若 请 他 ， 他 说 ： ‘ 侯门公 府 ， 必以 贵势 压人 ， 我 再不去 的 。 ’ ”,"' We have tried asking her , ' said Lin Zhi-xiao 's wife , ' but the reply she gives is that noble households are given to trampling on other people 's feelings , and she is not disposed to be trampled on . '"
王夫人 道 ： “ 他 既是 宦家 小姐 ， 自然 要性 傲 些 。,"' She is bound to be rather a proud young woman , coming from a family of officials , ' said Lady Wang ."
就 下 个 请帖 请 他 何妨 ？ ”,' I do not see why we should not make out a written invitation and request her formally . '
林之孝 家 的 答应 着 出去 ， 叫 书启 相公 写 个 请帖 去 请 妙玉 ， 次日 遣 人 备车 轿 去 接 。,Lin Zhi-xiao 's wife promised to see this done and hurried off ' to ask one of the professional letter-writers in the family 's employment to make out a formal invitation . Next day a carriage was sent round to fetch Adamantina to the mansion in a style befitting a young gentlewoman of tender susceptibilities .
不知 后来 如何 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,But as to what happened thereafter : that will be disclosed in the ensuing chapter .
第十八回,Chapter 18
皇恩 重元妃 省 父母,A brief family reunion is permitted by the magnanimity of a gracious Emperor
天伦乐 宝玉 呈 才 藻,And an Imperial Concubine takes pleasure in the literary progress of a younger brother
话 说 彼时 有人 回 ， 工程 上 等 着 糊 东西 的 纱 绫 ， 请 凤姐 去 开库 ； 又 有人 来回 ， 请 凤姐 收 金银 器皿 。,Just at that moment a servant came in to say that the workmen needed some gauze for pasting on window-lattices and asked Xi-feng if she would unlock the storeroom for them . Then another servant arrived and asked her to take charge of some gold and silver plate .
王夫人 并 上房 丫鬟 等 皆 不 得空儿 。,Lady Wang and her maids also seemed to be fully occupied .
宝钗因 说道 ： “ 咱们 别 在 这里 碍手碍脚 。 ” 说 着 ， 和 宝玉 等 便 往 迎春 房中 来 。,"Thoughtful Bao-chai pointed out to Bao-yu and the rest that they were getting in everyone 's way , and at her suggestion they all adjourned to Ying-chun 's room ."
王夫人 日日 忙乱 ， 直到 十月 里 才 全备 了 ：,Lady Wang 's busyness in fact continued unabated until well into the tenth month .
监办 的 都 交清 账目 ； 各处 古董 文玩 ， 俱 已 陈设 齐备 ； 采办 鸟雀 ， 自 仙鹤 、 鹿 、 兔 以及 鸡 、 鹅 等 ， 亦 已 买 全 ， 交 于 园中 各处 饲养 ； 贾蔷 那边 也 演出 二三十 出杂 戏来 ； 一班 小 尼姑 、 道姑 也 都 学会 念佛 诵经 。,"By then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the various buildings in the garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques ; supplies of livestock - cranes , deer , rabbits , chicken , geese , and so forth - had been purchased and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared ; Jia Qiang 's young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces ; and the little Buddhist and Taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their respective liturgies ."
于是 贾 政略 觉 心中 安顿 。,"Jia Zheng could now feel reasonably well satisfied that things were as they should be , and invited Grandmother Jia into the garden for a final inspection in which she was to suggest any last-minute alterations that might still be needed ."
遂 请 贾母 到 园中 ， 色色 斟酌 ， 点缀 妥当 ， 再 无 些微 不合 之 处 ， 贾政才 敢题 本 。,"When not the slightest shadow of an imperfection could any more be found , he at last sent in his written application for a Visitation ."
本上 之 日 ， 奉旨 ： “ 于 明年 正月十五 日 上 元 之 日 贵妃 省亲 。 ”,"The Gracious Reply arrived on the very same day : Her Grace will make a Family Visitation next year on the fifteenth of the first month , being the Festival of Lanterns ."
贾府 奉 了 此 旨 ， 一发 日夜 不 闲 ， 连年 也 不能 好生 过 了 。,"The receipt of this reply seemed to throw the Jia family into an even greater frenzy of preparation than before , so that even its New Year celebrations that year were somewhat scamped ."
转眼 元宵 在 迩 。,In no time at all the Festival of Lanterns seemed to be almost upon them .
自 正月 初八 ， 就 有 太监 出来 ， 先 看 方向 ： 何处 更衣 ， 何处 燕 坐 ， 何处 受礼 ， 何处 开宴 ， 何处 退息 。,"On the eighth of the first month a eunuch came from the Palace to inspect the layout of the Separate Residence and to establish where the Imperial Concubine would change her clothes ' , where she would sit to converse with her family , where she would receive their obeisances , where she would feast them , and where she would retire to when she wanted to rest ."
又 有 巡察 地方 总理 关防 太监 ， 带 了 许多 小太监 来 各处 关防 ， 挡 围幕 ， 指示 贾宅 人员 何处 出入 ， 何处 进膳 ， 何处 启事 ， 种种 仪注 。,"The eunuch Chief of Security also arrived with his eunuch minions and supervised a great deal of sealing-up and screening-off everywhere . He also instructed the members of the household in the regulations for leaving and entering , serving food and bringing messages , all of which had to be done through special entrances and exits and by special routes ."
外面 又 有 工部 官员 并 五城 兵马 司 打扫 街道 ， 撵 逐 闲人 。,"Outside the mansion the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and a gentleman from the Board of Works were busy supervising the sweeping of the surrounding streets and the chasing away of all idlers , onlookers and other suspicious-looking characters ."
贾 赦等 监督 匠人 扎 花灯 烟火 之类 ， 至 十四日 ， 俱 已 停妥 。,Meanwhile Jia She and the consortium were putting up ornamental lanterns everywhere in the gardens and fixing fireworks in place for a pyrotechnic display in honour of the visit . By the fourteenth everything was finally ready .
这 一夜 ， 上下 通 不曾 睡 。,"No one in the Jia household , whether master or servant , had a wink of sleep throughout the whole of that night ."
至 十五日 五 鼓 ， 自 贾母 等 有 爵者 ， 俱 各 按品 大妆 。,"By five o'clock next morning , when it was still dark night outside , all those in the family from Grandmother Jia downwards who held any sort of rank or title were already dressed in full court rig ."
此时 园内 帐舞 蟠龙 ， 帘 飞绣 凤 ， 金银 焕彩 ， 珠宝 生辉 ， 鼎 焚 百合 之 香 ， 瓶 插 长春 之 蕊 ， 静悄悄 无一 人 咳嗽 。,"In the Separate Residence painted phoenix and coiling dragon flapped and fluttered on drapes and curtains , gold and silver-work gleamed and glinted , jewels and gems made a fiery sparkle , subtle incenses smouldered in brazen censers , everlastings ' blossomed in china vases ; - and all was so silent , that throughout the whole of that great garden not the sound of a cough was to be heard ."
贾 赦等 在 西街 门外 ， 贾母 等 在 荣府 大 门外 。,Jia She and the other menfolk drew themselves up outside the west gate . Grandmother Jia stood outside the main gate with the female members of the family .
街头 巷口 ， 用 围幕 挡 严 。,They noticed that the ends of the street and the entrances of the side-streets leading into it had all been screened off .
正等 的 不耐烦 ， 忽 见 一个 太监 骑 着 匹 马来 了 ， 贾政 接着 ， 问 其 消息 。,"Just as they were beginning to grow impatient , a eunuch trotted up on horseback and was stopped and questioned by Jia Zheng ."
太监 道 ： “ 早 多着呢 ！,"' Oh , you are much too early yet ! ' said the eunuch ."
未初 用 晚 膳 ， 未正 还 到 宝灵宫 拜佛 ， 酉初 进 大明宫 领宴 看灯 方 请旨 。,"Her Grace will not be taking her lunch until one o'clock ; then at two she goes to divine service in the Bao-ling chapel . Five o'clock , when she has an appointment to feast with the Emperor in the Da-ming Palace and look at the New Year lanterns , is the first opportunity she will have of asking permission to leave ."
只怕 戌初 才 起身 呢 。 ”,I should be surprised if she got started much before seven o'clock this evening ! '
凤姐 听 了 道 ： “ 既 这样 ， 老太太 和 太太 且 请回 房 ， 等到 了 时候 ， 再来 也 还 不迟 。 ”,"' Well , ' said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when she heard this , ' you and Aunt Wang may as well go back to your room . You will be able to come back later on nearer the time . '"
于是 贾母 等 自便 去 了 。,"Grandmother Jia and the other ladies took her advice and went off , leaving Xi-feng to attend to whatever still needed doing in the garden ."
园中 俱 赖凤姐 照料 。 执事 人 等 ， 带领 太监 们 去 吃 酒饭 ， 一面 传人 挑进 蜡烛 ， 各处 点 起 灯 来 。,"Under her direction some of the stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine , while other servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden 's many lanterns with ."
忽 听 外面 马 跑 之 声 不 一 ， 有 十来个 太监 ， 喘吁吁 跑 来 拍手 儿 。,"Suddenly , as afternoon drew towards evening , a clatter of many hooves was heard , and after a short pause , a group of ten or so eunuchs rushed in out of breath , clapping their hands as they ran ."
这些 太监 都 会意 ， 知道 是 来 了 ， 各 按 方向 站立 。,"This was taken by the other eunuchs as a sign that the Imperial Concubine was on her way , for they at once jumped up and hurried to their prearranged places ."
贾 赦领 合族 子弟 在 西街 门外 ， 贾母 领合族 女眷 在 大 门外 迎接 ， 半日 静悄悄 的 。,"The family , too , took up their positions once more , Jia She and the menfolk outside the west gate and Grandmother Jia with the ladies outside the main entrance . For a long time there was total silence ."
忽 见 两个 太监 骑马 缓缓 而 来 ， 至 西街 门下 了 马 ， 将马 赶出 围幕 之外 ， 便面 西 站立 ； 半日 又 是 一对 ， 亦 是 如此 。,"Then a couple of eunuchs on horseback came riding very , very slowly up to the west gate . Dismounting , they led their horses out of sight behind the cloth screens , then returned to take up their stand at the sides of the road , half-facing towards the west . After a considerable wait , two more eunuchs arrived and went through the same motions as the first pair ."
少时 便 来 了 十来对 ， 方闻 隐隐 鼓乐 之 声 。,"Then another two , and then another , until in all some ten pairs were standing at the sides of the road , their faces turned expectantly towards the west ."
一对对 凤墨龙 旌 ， 雉 羽 宫扇 ， 又 有 销金 提炉 ， 焚着 御香 ， 然后 一把 曲柄 七 凤 金黄 伞 过来 ， 便是 冠袍带履 ， 又 有 执事 太监 捧 着 香巾 、 绣帕 、 漱 盂 、 拂尘 等物 。,"Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine 's procession at last came in sight First came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners . Then several more pairs with ceremonial pheasant-feather fans . Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special palace incense ' was burning . Next came a great gold-coloured ' seven-phoenix ' umbrella of state , hanging from its curve-topped shaft like a great drooping bell-flower . In its shadow was borne the Imperial Concubine 's travelling wardrobe : her head-dress , robe sash and shoes . Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary , her embroidered handkerchief , her spittoon , her fly-whisk , and various other items ."
一队 队 过完 ， 后面 方是 八个 太监 抬 着 一顶 金顶 鹅黄 绣 凤 銮舆 ， 缓缓 行来 。,"Last of all , when this army of attendants had gone by , a great gold-topped palanquin with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders of eight eunuch bearers ."
贾母 等 连忙 跪下 ， 早 有 太监 过来 ， 扶起 贾母 等 来 ， 将 那 銮舆 抬入 大门 往 东 一所 院落 门前 ， 有 太监 跪请 下 舆 更衣 ， 于是 入门 ， 太监 散 去 ， 只有 昭容 、 彩嫔 等 引着 元春 下 舆 。,"As Grandmother Jia and the rest dropped to their knees eunuchs rushed up and helped them to get up again . The palanquin passed through the great gate and made for the entrance of a courtyard on the east side of the forecourt . There a eunuch knelt beside it and invited the Imperial Concubine to descend and ' change her clothes ' . The bearers carried it through the entrance and set it down just inside the courtyard . The other eunuchs then withdrew , leaving Yuan-chun 's ladies-in-waiting to help her from the palanquin ."
只见 苑 内 各色 花灯 烟 灼 ， 皆 系 纱 绫 扎成 ， 精致 非常 。,The courtyard she now stepped out into was brilliant with coloured lanterns of silk gauze cunningly fashioned in all sorts of curious and beautiful shapes and patterns .
上面 有 一灯 匾 ， 写 着 “ 体仁 沐德 ” 四个 字 。,An illuminated sign hung over the entrance of the principal building : FILLED WITH FAVOURS BATHED IN BLESSINGS
元春 入室 ， 更衣 复出 ， 上舆 进园 。,"Yuan-chun passed beneath it into the room that had been prepared for her , then , having changed her clothes ' , came out again and stepped back into the palanquin , which was now borne into the garden ."
只见 园中 香烟 缭绕 ， 花影 缤纷 ， 处处 灯光 相映 ， 时时 细 乐声 喧 ： 说 不尽 这 太平 景象 ， 富贵 风流 。,"Her first impression was a confused one of curling drifts of incense smoke and gleaming colours . There were lanterns everywhere , and soft strains of music . She seemed to be entering a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and luxury and delight ."
却说 贾妃 在 轿 内 看 了 此 园内 外 光景 ， 因 点头 叹 道 ： “ 太 奢华 过费 了 ！ ”,"Looking at it from the depths of her palanquin she shook her head a little sadly and sighed : ' Oh dear , this is all so extravagant !"
忽 又 见 太监 跪请 登舟 。,At that moment a eunuch knelt beside the palanquin and invited the Imperial Concubine to proceed by boat .
贾妃 下 舆 登舟 ， 只见 清流 一带 ， 势 若 游龙 ， 两边 石栏 上 ， 皆 系 水晶玻璃 各色 风灯 ， 点 的 如 银光 雪浪 ；,"Stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon . Lanterns of crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks , their silvery radiance giving the white marble , in the semi-darkness , the appearance of gleaming drifts of snow ."
上面 柳杏 诸树 ， 虽 无 花叶 ， 却 用 各色 绸 绫纸 绢 及 通草 为 花 ， 粘于 枝 上 ， 每 一株 悬灯 万盏 ；,"Because of the season , the willows and apricot trees above them were bare and leafless ; but in place of leaves they were festooned with hundreds of tiny lanterns , and flowers of gauze , rice-paper and bast had been fastened to the tips of their branches ."
更 兼 池 中 荷 荇 凫鹭 诸 灯 ， 亦 皆 系 螺蚌 羽毛 做 就 的 ， 上下 争辉 ， 水天 焕彩 ， 真是 玻璃 世界 ， 珠宝 乾坤 。,"Other lanterns made of shells and feathers , in the form of lotuses , water-lilies , ducks and egrets floated on the surface of the water below . It would have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the more brilliant spectacle . Together they combined to make a fairyland of jewelled light ."
船上 又 有 各种 盆景 ， 珠帘 绣幕 ， 桂楫兰 桡 ， 自不必说 了 。,"And to these visual delights were added the many charming miniature gardens on the barge itself - not to mention its pearl blinds , embroidered curtains , and the carved and painted oars and paddle with which it was furnished ."
已而 入 一 石港 ， 港 上 一面 匾灯 ， 明现 着 “ 蓼 汀花 溆 ” 四 字 。,"While Yuan-chun was still admiring all this , her boat approached a landing-stage in a grotto , above which hung a lantern-sign inscribed with these words : SMARTWEED BANK AND FLOWERY HARBOUR"
看官 听说 ：,Stone 's Note to Reader :
这 “ 蓼 汀花 溆 ” 及 “ 有凤来仪 ” 等 字 ， 皆 系 上 回 贾 政偶 试 宝玉 之 才 ， 何至 便 认真 用 了 ？,"You may find it surprising that ' Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour ' , ' The Phoenix Dance ' and those other names , which in the last chapter we showed Bao-yu inventing in an aptitude test imposed at random by his father , should actually have been used on the occasion of the Imperial Concubine 's first visit to her family ."
想 贾府 世代 诗书 ， 自有 一二名 手 题咏 ， 岂似 暴富 之 家 ， 竟以 小儿 语 搪塞 了 事 呢 ？,"Surely , you will say , a household as long established and highly cultivated as the Jias ' must have had several well-known talents at its disposal which it could have called upon for such important purposes as these ? These were no wealthy parvenus whose vulgarity would be satisfied with the effusions of a gifted schoolboy for filling in the gaps where inscriptions are felt to be de rigueur ."
只 因 当日 这 贾妃 未 入 宫 时 ， 自幼 亦 系 贾母 教养 。 后来 添 了 宝玉 ， 贾妃 乃 长姊 ， 宝玉 为 幼弟 ， 贾妃 念母 年 将 迈 ， 始得 此 弟 ， 是 以 独 爱怜 之 。 且同 侍贾母 ， 刻不 相离 。,"The answer lies in Yuan-chun 's special relationship with Bao-yu . Before Yuan-chun entered the Palace , she had been brought up mainly by Grandmother Jia ; and when Bao-yu appeared on the scene ( at a time when his mother was already middle-aged and unlikely to have any more children ) she had lavished all her affection on this little brother who spent all his time with her at their grandmother 's ."
那宝玉 未 入学 之 先 ， 三四岁 时 ， 已 得 元妃 口传 教授 了 几本书 ， 识 了 数千 字 在 腹中 。,"When he was still a very little boy of only three or four and had not yet begun his schooling , she had taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters ."
虽为 姊弟 ， 有如 母子 。 自入 宫后 ， 时时 带 信 出来 与 父兄 说 ： “ 千万 好生 扶养 ：,"Although they were brother and sister , their relationship was more like that of a mother and her son ; and even after she entered the Palace , she was always writing letters to her father and her male cousins in which she expressed concern for the little boy who was so constantly in her thoughts . ' I beg you to be most careful in your handling of this child , ' she once wrote ."
不严 不能 成器 ； 过 严恐 生 不虞 ， 且致 祖母 之 忧 。 ”,"If you are not strict with him , he will never grow up into a proper man . But if you are too strict , you may endanger his health and cause Grandmother to be distressed . '"
眷念 之 心 ， 刻刻 不 忘 。,
前日 贾政闻 塾师 赞 他 尽 有 才情 ， 故 于 游园 时 聊一试 之 ， 虽非 名公 大笔 ， 却是 本家 风味 ； 且使 贾妃 见 之 ， 知爱 弟 所为 ， 亦 不负 其 平日 切望 之 意 。,"When , some months previously , Jia Zheng received a favourable report from Bao-yu 's schoolmaster in which his creative ability was commended , he had used the visit to the garden as a means of trying him out . The results were not , of course , what a great writer would have produced in similar circumstances , but at least they were not unworthy of the family 's literary traditions , and Jia Zheng resolved that his daughter should see them , so that she might know that the progress made by her beloved younger brother fully came up to the measure of those ardent hopes she had so often expressed in her letters ."
因此 故 将 宝玉 所题 用 了 。,
— — 那日 未题 完 之处 ， 后来 又 补题 了 许多 。,"- Incidentally , Bao-yu had , in the intervening time , supplied many more inscriptions for the places they had been unable to cover on that first occasion ."
,Stone
且说 贾妃 看 了 四 字 ， 笑 道 ： “ ‘ 花溆 ’ 二 字 便 好 ， 何必 ‘ 蓼 汀 ’ ？ ”,"When Yuan-chun saw the words ' Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour ' she laughed . ' Surely "" Flowery Harbour "" is enough by itself ? Why "" Smartweed Bank "" as well ? '"
侍 坐 太监 听 了 ， 忙 下 舟 登岸 ， 飞传 与 贾政 ， 贾政 即刻 换 了 。,"At once an attendant eunuch disembarked and rushed like the wind to tell Jia Zheng , who immediately gave orders to have the inscription changed ."
彼时 舟临 内岸 ， 去 舟 上 舆 ， 便 见 琳宫 绰约 ， 桂殿 巍峨 ， 石牌坊 上 写 着 “ 天仙 宝镜 ” 四大 字 ， 贾妃 命换 了 “ 省亲 别墅 ” 四 字 。,By this time the barge had drawn alongside the bank and Yuan-chun disembarked and stepped once more into her palanquin . Soon she was borne into that part of the garden where ' Roof above roof soared Eye up-compelling . . . ' and saw the white marble memorial arch which had so stongly affected Bao-yu when he first saw it . It now bore a temporary inscription : PRECINCT OF THE CELESTIAL VISITANT Yuan-chun gave orders that the words ' The House of Reunion ' should be substituted .
于是 进入 行宫 ， 只见 庭 燎绕 空 ， 香屑 布地 ， 火树琪花 ， 金窗 玉槛 ； 说 不尽 帘 卷 虾 须 ， 毯铺 鱼獭 ， 鼎飘 麝脑 之 香 ， 屏列 雉尾 之 扇 。,"She now ascended the terraces and entered the open-fronted hall of audience . From a ring of cressets against the night shy a fragrant scatter dropped on the flagstones ; and candelabra like fiery fir-trees gleamed festively in the gilded casements ; there were blinds looped and fringed like a prawn 's belly , there were rugs in rows like an otter 's offering and tripods smoked with perfumes of musk and borneol , and behind the throne waved fans of pheasant feathers ."
真是 ：,It was a scene no whit less splendid than that fairy palace of which the poet sings :
金门 玉户 神仙 府 ，,
桂殿兰宫 妃子 家 。,The abode of the Princess has cassia halls and orchid chambers .
贾妃 乃 问 ： “ 此 殿 何无 匾额 ？ ”,' How is it that this place has no name ? ' asked Yuan-chun .
随 侍太监 跪 启道 ： “ 此 系 正殿 ， 外臣 未敢 擅拟 。 ”,"' This is the principal hall of the Residence , Your Grace . The family dared not give it a name without consulting you first . '"
贾妃 点头 。,Her Grace nodded .
礼仪 太监 请 升座 受礼 ， 两阶 乐 起 。 二 太监 引赦 政 等于 月 台下 排班 上殿 ， 昭容 传谕 曰 ： “ 免 。 ” 乃退 。,"A eunuch Master of Ceremonies now requested her to seat herself upon a chair of state in order to receive the obeisances of her family . Music struck up from a band stationed at either side of the steps as two eunuchs conducted Jia She and Jia Zheng onto the terrace beneath . The other male members of the family ranged themselves behind them and the whole party then began to advance in formation up the steps into the hall . ' Excused ! ' A lady-in-waiting came forward and uttered this single word as an indication that the Imperial Concubine wished to absolve them from the ceremonial , and with a slight bow they withdrew ."
又 引荣 国 太君 及 女眷 等 自东阶升 月 台上 排班 ， 昭容 再 谕 曰 ： “ 免 。 ” 于是 亦 退 。,"It was now the turn of Grandmother Jia ( the Dowager Lady Jia of Rong-guo ' they called her ) and the ladies of the household to make their obeisance . The eunuchs led them up the steps at the east side of the terrace on to the platform in front of the hall , where they ranged themselves in order of precedence . Once more the lady-in-waiting pronounced the absolving word and they , too , withdrew ."
茶 三献 ， 贾妃 降 座 ， 乐止 ， 退入 侧室 更衣 ， 方备 省亲 车驾 出园 。,"After tea had been offered three times as etiquette prescribed , the Imperial Concubine descended from her throne , the music stopped , and she withdrew into a side room to ' change her clothes ' . A less formal carriage than the imperial palanquin had been prepared which carried her from the garden to her family 's own quarters ."
至 贾母正 室 ， 欲 行家 礼 ， 贾母 等 俱 跪止 之 。,Inside Grandmother Jia 's apartment Yuan-chun became a grandchild once more and knelt down to make her kotow . But Grandmother Jia and the rest knelt down too and prevented her from prostrating herself .
贾妃 垂泪 ， 彼此 上前 厮见 ， 一手 挽 贾母 ， 一手 挽 王夫人 ， — — 三 人 满心 皆 有 许多 话 ， 但 说不出 ， 只是 呜咽 对泣 而已 。,"She ended up , clinging to Grandmother Jia by one hand and Lady Wang by the other , while the tears streamed down her face , too overcome to say anything . All three of them , in fact , though there was so much they wanted to say , seemed quite incapable of speech and stood there holding each other and sobbing , apparently unable to stop ."
邢夫人 、 李 纨 、 王熙凤 、 迎春 、 探春 、 惜春 等 ， 俱 在 旁 垂泪 无言 。,"The others present - Lady Xing , Li Wan , Wang Xi-feng , Ying-chun , Tan-chun and Xi-chun - stood round them weeping silently . No one spoke a word ."
半日 ， 贾妃 方忍 悲强 笑 ， 安慰 道 ： “ 当日 既 送 我 到 那 不得 见 人 的 去处 ， 好容易 今日 回家 ， 娘儿们 这时 不说 不 笑 ， 反倒 哭 个 不了 ， 一会 子 我 去 了 ， 又 不知 多早晚 才能 一 见 ！ ”,"Yuan-chun at last restrained her sobs and forced a smile to her tear-stained face : ' It hasn ' t been easy , winning this chance of coming back among you after all those years since I was first walled up in That Place . Now that we are seeing each other at last , we ought to talk and be cheerful , not waste all the time crying ! I shall be leaving again in no time at all , and Heaven only knows when I shall have another chance of seeing you ! '"
说 到 这 句 ， 不禁 又 哽咽 起来 。 邢夫人 忙 上来 劝解 。,At this point she broke down once more and had to be comforted by Lady Xing .
贾母 等 让 贾妃 归 坐 ， 又 逐次 一一 见 过 ， 又 不免 哭泣 一番 。,"When she had composed herself , Grandmother Jia made her sit down while the members of the family came forward one at a time to greet her and say a few words . This was an occasion for further tears ."
然后 东西 两府 执事 人 等 在外 厅 行礼 。,Then the senior menservants of both the Rong-guo and Ning-guo mansions assembled in the courtyard outside and paid their respects .
其 媳妇 丫鬟 行礼 毕 。,"They were followed by the womenservants and maids , who were allowed to come inside the room to make their kotow ."
〈 贾妃 因 问 ： “ 薛姨妈 、 宝钗 、 黛玉 因 何不 见 ？ ”,Yuan-chun asked why her Aunt Xue and her cousins Bao-chai and Lin Dai-yu were missing .
王夫人 启道 ： “ 外眷 无职 ， 不敢 擅 人 。 ”,"' Relations outside the Jia family are not allowed to see you without a special invitation , dear ; Lady Wang told her ."
贾妃 听 了 ， 忙 命 快 请 。 〉,"Yuan-chun asked them to be invited in immediately , and Aunt Xue and the two girls arrived after a few moments ."
一时 薛姨妈 等 进来 ， 欲 行 国礼 ， 元妃 降旨 免过 ， 上前 各 叙 阔别 。,"They would have kotowed to her in accordance with court etiquette had not Yuan-chun hurriedly excused them from doing so . The three of them went up to her , and niece and aunt exchanged news of the years that had elapsed since they last met ."
又 有 原带 进宫 的 丫鬟 抱 琴 等 叩见 ， 贾母 连忙 扶 起 ， 命入 别室 款待 。,Next Lutany and the other maids who had accompanied Yuan-chun into the Palace came forward to make their kotows to Grandmother Jia . The old lady at once motioned to them to rise and gave instructions to her own servants to entertain them in another room .
执事 太监 及 彩嫔 昭容 各 侍从 人 等 ， 宁府 及 贾 赦那宅 两处 自 有人 款待 ， 只 留 三四个 小太监 答应 。,"The senior eunuchs and the ladies-in-waiting were now led off by members of the staffs of Jia She is household and the Ning-guo mansion to be entertained elsewhere , leaving only three or four very junior eunuchs in attendance ."
母女 姊妹 ， 不免 叙 些 久 别的 情景 ， 及 家务 私情 。,Yuan-chun was at last free to chat informally with her mother and the other female members of her family and learned for the first time about many personal and domestic events that had occurred in the household since she left it .
又 有 贾政 至 帘 外 问安 行参 等 事 。,"Then there was her interview with Jia Zheng , which had to take place with her father standing outside the door-curtain of the room in which she was sitting ."
,"Now that she was the Emperor 's woman , this was the nearest to her he could ever hope to get ."
,The sense of deprivation struck home to Yuan-chun as she addressed him through the curtain .
元妃 又 向 其父 说道 ： “ 田舍 之 家 ， 虀 盐 布帛 ， 得 遂 天伦之乐 ， 今 虽 富贵 ， 骨肉分离 ， 终 无 意趣 。 ”,"What is the use of all this luxury and splendour , she said bitterly , ' if I am to be always separated from those I love - denied the tenderness which even the poorest peasant who seasons his bread with salt and pickles and dresses in hempen homespun is free to enjoy ? '"
贾政亦 含泪 启道 ： “ 臣 草芥 寒门 ， 鸠 群鸦 属 之中 ， 岂意 得征 凤鸾 之 瑞 。,With tears in his eyes the good man delivered the following little speech to the daughter he could not see :
今 贵人 上锡 天恩 ， 下 昭 祖德 ， 此 皆 山川 日月 之 精华 ， 祖宗 之 远 德 ， 钟 于 一 人 ， 幸及 政 夫妇 。,"' Madam . That a poor and undistinguished household such as ours should have produced , as it were , a phoenix from amidst a flock of crows and pies to bask in the sunshine of Imperial favour and shed its reflected beams on the departed representatives of our ancestral line must be attributable to the concentration in your single person of the quintessences of all that is most admirable in celestial and terrestrial nature and the accumulated merit of many generations of our forebears , and is an honour and a blessing in which my wife and I are proud to be participators ."
且 今 上体 天地生 生之 大德 ， 垂 古今 未有 之 旷恩 ， 虽 肝脑涂地 ， 岂能 报效万一 ！ 惟 朝乾夕惕 ， 忠于 厥 职 。,"Our beloved Emperor , who embodies in his own Sacred Person those life-giving forces which are always invisibly at work in the natural cosmos , has showered down upon his grateful subjects a gracious kindness unprecedented in the annals of recorded history - a kindness which even the expenditure of our life 's blood to the veriest ultimate drop would be wholly inadequate to repay and which only the most unremitting pains and unswerving loyalty in the discharge of those duties to which it has pleased him to call us could adequately express ."
伏 愿 圣君 万岁千秋 ， 乃 天下 苍生之 福 也 。 贵妃 切勿 以 政 夫妇 残年 为 念 。 更 祈自 加 珍爱 ， 惟 勤慎 肃恭 以 侍 上 ， 庶 不负 上 眷顾 隆恩 也 。 ”,"It is our earnest prayer that His Sacred Majesty may continue long to reign over us , a blessing to all his peoples ; and that Your Grace should feel no anxiety concerning the welfare of my wife and myself during our now declining years , but should rather cherish and sustain your own precious person , in order to be the better able to serve His Sacred Majesty with care and diligence , seeking by that service to be worthy of the tender regard and loving favour which he has been graciously pleased to bestow upon you . '"
贾妃 亦 嘱以 “ 国 事宜 勤 ， 暇时 保养 ， 切勿 记念 。 ”,"To this formal speech the Imperial Concubine made a formal reply : ' Sir . It is of course desirable that you should exercise the utmost diligence when engaged upon business of state , but it is to be hoped that you will take sufficient care of your own well-being whenever not so engaged , and will under no circumstances vex yourself with anxiety on our behalf . '"
贾政又 启 ： “ 园中 所有 亭台 轩 馆 ， 皆 系 宝玉 所题 ； 如果 有 一二 可 寓目 者 ， 请 即 赐 名为 幸 。 ”,"' The inscriptions at present displayed on the pavilions and other buildings in the garden were composed by Bao-yu , ' said Jia Zheng . If there are any places in the garden which particularly take your fancy , we hope you will name them for us . '"
元妃 听 了 宝玉 能题 ， 便 含笑 说道 ： “ 果 进益 了 。 ”,"The news that Bao-yu could already compose inscriptions evoked a smile of pleasure . ' He has made progress , then ! '"
贾政 退出 。,Jia Zheng withdrew .
元妃 因 问 ： “ 宝玉 因 何不 见 ？ ”,' But why is Bao-yu not with us ? ' she added .
贾母乃 启道 ： “ 无 谕 ， 外 男 不敢 擅入 。 ”,"' The menfolk of the family are not supposed to see you without special reason , ' Grandmother Jia explained ."
元妃 命 快 引进 来 。 小太监 引 宝玉 进来 ， 先行 国 礼毕 ， 命 他 近前 ， 携手 揽 于 怀内 ， 又 抚 其 头颈 笑 道 ： “ 比先 长 了 好些 — — ”,"Yuan-chun at once gave orders that he should be summoned , and presently he was brought in by one of the little eunuchs . When he had completed his kotow she called him over , and stretching out her arms , drew him to her bosom where she held him in a close embrace , stroking his hair and fondling the back of his neck . ' What a lot you have grown - ! ' she began ."
一 语 未终 ， 泪如雨下 。,But the rest was drowned in a flood of tears .
尤氏凤 姐 等 上来 启道 ： “ 筵宴 齐备 ， 请 贵妃 游幸 。 ”,You-shi and Xi-feng now approached to announce that a feast awaited her in the Separate Residence .
元妃 起身 ， 命 宝玉 导引 ， 遂 同 诸 人步 至 园 门前 。,"Yuan-chun rose to her feet , and bidding Bao-yu lead the way , walked with the rest of the company to the gate of the garden ."
早 见 灯光 之中 ， 诸般 罗列 ， 进园 先 从 “ 有凤来仪 ” 、 “ 红香绿 玉 ” 、 “ 杏帘 在 望 ” 、 “ 蘅 芷 清芬 ” 等 处 ， 登楼 步阁 ， 涉水 缘山 ， 眺览 徘徊 。,"There , in the light of the innumerable lanterns , all kinds of spectacles had been prepared for her entertainment . The route led through ' The Phoenix Dance ' , ' Fragrant Red and Lucent Green ' , ' The Hopeful Sign ' , and ' The Garden of Spices ' . This time the inspection was no perfunctory one . Yuan-chun insisted on looking inside the buildings and climbing up and down their stairs . She crossed bridges , she walked round each tiny ' mountain ' , and every once in a while she stopped to look about her and admire the view ."
一处处 铺陈 华丽 ， 一桩 桩 点缀 新奇 。 元妃 极 加奖 赞 ， 又 劝 ： “ 以后 不可 太奢 了 ， 此 皆 过分 。 ”,"All the places she visited were so beautifully furnished and so ingeniously planned , that she could not conceal her delight . But there was a faint note of censure in her praise : ' You really must not be so extravagant in future . This is far too much ! '"
既而 来 至 正殿 ， 降谕 免礼 归 坐 ， 大 开 筵宴 ， 贾母 等 在 下 相陪 ， 尤氏 、 李 纨 、 凤姐 等 捧 羹 把盏 。,"They had now come to the main hall . Having first decreed that they should dispense with court etiquette - which would have prevented the older ladies from sitting down at all - she took her place at the main table , while Grandmother Jia and the rest sat at little tables on either side , and You-shi , Li Wan and Xi-feng moved to and fro , dispensing wine and helping with the service ."
元妃 乃 命 笔砚 伺候 ， 亲 拂 罗笺 ， 择 其 喜者 赐 名 。,"While they were still drinking , Yuan-chun sent for writing materials , and taking up a brush , began in her own hand to write out some names for the parts of the garden she had liked the best ."
因题 其 园 之 总 名曰 “ 大观园 ” ， 正殿 匾额 云 ： “ 顾恩思 义 ” ， 对联 云 ：,"The name she chose for the garden as a whole was ' Prospect Garden ' , and she composed the following couplet to go outside the main reception hall :"
天地 启 宏慈 ， 赤子 苍生 同感 戴 ；,"For all earth to share , his great compassion has been extended , that children and humble folk may gratefully rejoice ."
古今 垂旷典 ， 九州 万国 被 恩荣 。,"For all ages to admire , his noble institutions have been promoted , that people of every land and clime may joyfully exult ."
又 改 题 ： “ 有凤来仪 ” 赐 名 “ 潇湘 馆 ” 。 “ 红香绿 玉 ” 改作 “ 怡红 快 绿 ” ， 赐 名 “ 怡红院 ” 。,"She altered ' The Phoenix Dance ' to The Naiad 's House ' , and she renamed ' Fragrant Red and Lucent Green ' ' Crimson Joys and Green Delights ' and named the building in its grounds ' The House of Green Delights ' ."
“ 蘅 芷 清芬 ” 赐 名 “ 蘅 芜院 ” 。,The buildings belonging to ' The Garden of Spices ' she named ' All-spice Court ' .
“ 杏帘 在 望 ” 赐 名 “ 浣 葛 山庄 ” 。,Those of ' The Hopeful Sign ' she gave the name Washbrook Farm ' .
正楼 曰 “ 大观楼 ” 。 东面 飞楼 曰 “ 缀 锦楼 ” 。 西面 叙楼 曰 “ 含芳阁 ” 。,"The main hall became ' Prospect Hall ' with separate names for the high galleries on either side : The Painted Chamber for the one on the east side , The Fragrance Gallery ' for the one on the west ."
更 有 “ 蓼 风 轩 ” 、 “ 藕 香榭 ” 、 “ 紫菱洲 ” 、 “ 荇 叶渚 ” 等名 。,"Among the other names which she invented for various other parts of the garden were : ' The Smartweed Loggia ' , ' The Lotus Pavilion ' , ' Amaryllis Eyot ' , and ' Duckweed Island ' ."
匾额 有 “ 梨花 春雨 ” 、 “ 桐 剪 秋风 ” 、 “ 荻 芦 夜 雪 ” 等名 。,"She also composed inscriptions for some of its prospects , including Pear-tree blossom in springtime rain ' , Paulownia leaves in autumn wind ' , and Rushes in the winter snow ' ."
又 命 旧有 匾联 不可 摘去 。,The couplets composed by Bao-yu were to remain unaltered .
于是 先题 一 绝句 云 ：,"Having finished with the inscriptions , she proceeded to write out the following quatrain of her own composition :"
衔 山 抱 水 建来 精 ，,"Embracing hills and streams , with skill they wrought"
多少 工夫 筑始 成 ！,Their work at last is to perfection brought .
天上人间 诸景备 ，,"Earth 's fairest prospects all are here installed ,"
芳园 应 锡 “ 大观 ” 名 。,So ' Prospect Garden ' let its name be called !
题 毕 ， 向 诸 姐妹 笑 道 ： “ 我素 乏捷 才 ， 且 不 长于 吟咏 ， 姐妹 辈素 所 深知 ；,"' There ! ' she said with a smile to the girls . ' I am no genius , as you all well know , and I have never been much of a poet ."
今夜 聊以塞责 ， 不负 斯景 而已 ， 异日 少暇 ， 必 补 撰 ‘ 大观园 记 ’ 并 ‘ 省亲 颂 ’ 等 文 ， 以 记 今日 之 事 。,"But tonight I thought I really must write something for this beautiful garden 's sake . Later on , when I have more time to spare , I intend to write a Description of Prospect Garden and a set of verses to be entitled The Visitation in commemoration of this wonderful night ."
妹 等 亦 各 题 一 匾 一 诗 ， 随意 发挥 ， 不可 为 我 微才 所 缚 。,"But meanwhile I should like each of you girls to compose an inscription that could be used somewhere in the garden , and also a poem to go with it . Just write anything that comes into your heads . I do not want you to restrict yourselves by trying to make your poems in any way relate to my own poor effort ."
且 知 宝玉 竟 能 题咏 ， 一发 可喜 。 此中 潇湘 馆 蘅 芜院 二处 ， 我 所 极 爱 ； 次之 怡红院 浣 葛 山庄 ： 此 四大 处 ， 必得别 有 章句 题咏 方妙 。 前所 题 之 联 虽 佳 ， 如今 再 各 赋 五 言律 一首 ， 使 我 当 面试 过 ， 方 不负 我 自幼 教授 之 苦心 。 ”,"As for Bao-yu : I am very pleased that he is able to compose verses so well , and I want him to write me an octet for each of the four places in the garden I like best : the Naiad 's House , All-spice Court - those are my two favourites - the House of Green Delights , and Washbrook Farm . The couplets he has already written for them are very good , but these are four such special places , that I feel they deserve to have something more written about them . And apart from that , if Bao-yu can show me these four poems while I am here , I shall feel that the efforts I made at teaching him when he was a little boy were worth while . '"
宝玉 只得 答应 了 ， 下 来自 去 构思 。,"Bao-yu could scarcely refuse , and went off to rack his brains for some good lines ."
迎春 、 探春 、 惜春 三 人 中 ， 要算 探春 又 出于 姊妹 之上 ， 然 自忖 似难 与 薛林 争衡 ， 只得 随众 应命 。,Tan-chun was by far the most gifted of the Three Springs and joined Bao-chai and Dai-yu in writing octets .
李 纨也 勉强 作成 一 绝 。,"Li Wan , Ying-chun and Xi-chun , none of whom had any talent for versification , contented themselves with a quatrain apiece , but found even four lines a considerable effort ."
贾妃 挨次 看 姊妹 们 的 题咏 ， 写道 是 ：,"When the girls had all finished , Yuan-chun took up the papers one by one and examined the results of their labours ."
,Here is what they had written :
旷性 怡情 （ 匾额 ） 迎春,Ying-chun : Heart 's Ease
园 成 景物 特 精奇 ，,"The garden finished , all is prospects please ."
奉命 羞 题额 旷怡 。,"Bidden to write , I name this spot Heart 's Ease '"
谁 信 世间 有此 境 ，,Who would have thought on earth such scenes to find
游来宁 不畅 神思 ？,As here refresh the heart and ease the mind ?
文采风流 （ 匾额 ） 探春,Tan-chun : Brightness and Grace
秀水明山 抱复 回 ，,"Water on hills and hills on waters smile ,"
风流 文采 胜 蓬莱 。,More bright and graceful than the Immortal Isle .
绿裁 歌扇 迷 芳草 ，,Midst odorous herbs the singer 's green fan hides ;
红衬湘 裙 舞落 梅 。,Her crimson skirt through falling petals glides .
珠玉 自 应传 盛世 ，,"A radiant jewel to the world is shown ,"
神仙 何幸 下 瑶台 ！,A fairy princess from her tower come down :
名园 一自 邀 游赏 ，,"And since her steps the garden 's walks have trod ,"
未许 凡人 到 此来 。,No mortal foot must desecrate its sod .
文章 造化 （ 匾额 ） 惜春,Xi-chun : Art the Creator
山水 横 拖 千里 外 ，,The garden s landscape far and wide outspreads ;
楼台 高 起 五 云中 。,High in the clouds its buildings raise their heads ;
园 修 日月 光辉 里 ，,"Serene in moonlight , radiant in the sun -"
景夺 文章 造化 功 。,Great Nature 's handiwork has been outdone !
万象 争辉 （ 匾额 ） 李 纨,Li Wan : All Things Bright and Beautiful
名园 筑 就势 巍巍 ，,The finished garden is a wondrous sight .
奉命 多 惭学 浅微 。,"Unlettered and unskilled , I blush to write ."
精妙 一时 言 不尽 ，,"Its marvels are not in one phrase expressed ,"
果然 万物 有 光辉 。,Yet Bright and Beautiful ' I judge the best .
凝晖 钟瑞 （ 匾额 ） 薛宝钗,Xue Bao-chai : Auspicious Skies
芳 园筑 向 帝 城西 ，,West of imperial walls the garden lies ;
华日 祥云 笼罩 奇 。,The sun beams on it from auspicious shies .
高柳喜 迁莺出谷 ，,Its willows orioles from the vale invite ;
修 篁 时 待 凤来仪 。,Tall bamboos tempt the phoenix to alight .
文风 已 著 宸 游 夕 ，,Poetic arts this night must celebrate
孝 化应隆 归省 时 。,Filial affection dressed in robes of state .
睿 藻 仙 才 瞻仰 处 ，,"Dare I , who have those jewelled phrases read ,"
自惭 何敢 再为 辞 ？,Add more to what She has already said ?
世外 仙源 （ 匾额 ） 林黛玉,Lin Dai-yu : The Fairy Stream
宸 游增悦 豫 ，,To fairy haunts far from the world 's annoy
仙境 别 红尘 。,A royal visit brings a double joy .
借 得 山川 秀 ，,A thousand borrowed beauties here combined
添来 气象 新 。,In this new setting ncw enchantment find .
香融 金谷 酒 ，,Its odours sweet a poet 's wine enrich ;
花媚玉 堂 人 。,Its flowers a queenly visitor bewitch .
何幸 邀 恩宠 ，,May she and we this favour hope to gain :
宫车 过往 频 。,That of-times she may pass this way again !
元妃 看毕 ， 称赏不已 ， 又 笑 道 ： “ 终是 薛林 二妹 之 作 与众不同 ， 非 愚 姊妹 所 及 。 ”,"As soon as she had finished reading the poems , Yuan-chun praised them all warmly . ' But Cousin Lin 's and Cousin Xue 's poems are specially good , ' she said . ' Our Jia girls are no match for them ! """
原来 黛玉 安心 今夜 大展 奇才 ， 将 众人 压倒 ， 不想 元妃 只命 一 匾 一 咏 ， 倒 不好 违谕 多 做 ， 只 胡乱 做 了 一首五 言律 应命 便 罢了 。,"Dai-yu had confidently expected that this night would give her an opportunity of deploying her talents to the full and amazing everyone with her genius . It was very disappointing that no more had been required of her than a single little poem and an inscription ; and though she was obliged to confine herself to what the Imperial Concubine had commanded , she had composed her octet without enthusiasm and in very perfunctory manner ."
时 宝玉 尚未 做 完 ， 才 做 了 “ 潇湘 馆 ” 与 “ 蘅 芜院 ” 两首 ， 正 做 “ 怡红院 ” 一首 ， 起稿 内 有 “ 绿玉春 犹卷 ” 一句 。 宝钗 转眼 瞥见 ， 便 趁 众人 不 理论 ， 推 他 道 ：,Meanwhile Bao-yu was far from finished with his consignment . He had finished composing the poems for the Naiad 's House and All-spice Court and was still in the middle of a poem on the House of Green Delights . Bao-chai took a peep over his shoulder and noticed that his draft contained the line Some wear sheathed skirts of lucent green curled tight . When no one was looking she gave him a nudge :
“ 贵人 因 不喜 ‘ 红香绿 玉 ’ 四 字 ， 才 改 了 ‘ 怡红 快 绿 ’ ， 你 这 会子 偏 又 用 ‘ 绿玉 ’ 二 字 ， 岂不是 有意 和 他 分驰 了 ？,"' You can tell Her Grace did not like "" lucent green "" because she only just now altered it to something else in your inscription . If you insist on using it in your poem , it will look as if you are deliberately flaunting your difference of opinion ."
况且 蕉叶 之 典故 颇 多 ， 再 想 一个 改 了 罢 。 ”,"There are so many allusions to plantain leaves you could use , you should not have much difficulty in substituting something else . '"
宝玉 见 宝钗 如此 说 ， 便 拭 汗 说道 ： “ 我 这 会子 总 想不起 什么 典故 出处 来 ！ ”,"' It is all very well for you to talk , ' said Bao-yu , mopping the perspiration from his brow , ' but at this particular moment I can not think of any allusion that would do . '"
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 你 只 把 ‘ 绿玉 ’ 的 ‘ 玉 ’ 字 改作 ‘ 蜡 ’ 字 就是 了 。 ”,"Why do not you put "" in spring green waxen sheaths "" in place of your "" sheathed skirts of lucent green "" ?"
宝玉 道 ： “ ‘ 绿蜡 ’ 可 有 出处 ？ ”,"' Where do you get "" green waxen "" from ? ' said Bao-yu ."
宝钗 悄悄的 咂嘴 点头 笑 道 ： “ 亏 你 今夜 不过如此 ， 将来 金殿 对策 ， 你 大约 连 ‘ 赵钱孙 李 ’ 都 忘 了 呢 ！,"' Tut , tut , tut ! ' Bao-chai shook her head pityingly . ' If this is what you are like tonight , Heaven knows what you will be like in a few years ' time when you come to take the Palace Examination . Probably you will find you have forgotten even the Child 's First Primer of Rhyming Names ."
— — 唐朝 ｛ 钱 珝 ｝ 咏 芭蕉 诗头 一句 ： ‘ 冷烛 无烟 绿 蜡 干 ’ 都 忘 了 么 ？ ”,"It is from the Tang poet Qian Xu 's poem "" Furled Plantains "" : Green waxen candles from which no fames rise . Do you mean to say you have forgotten that ? '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 不觉 洞开 心意 ， 笑 道 ： “ 该死 ， 该死 ！,"The scales fell from Bao-yu 's eyes . ' Good gracious , how stupid of me !"
眼前 现成 的 句子 竟 想不到 。,The words are there ready-made and I did not think of them !
姐姐 真是 ‘ 一字师 ’ 了 ！,"I shall have to call you my "" One Word Teacher "" , like the poet in the story ! '"
从此 只 叫 你 师傅 ， 再 不 叫 姐姐 了 。 ”,"I shall not be able to treat you like a sister any more , I shall have to say "" sir "" when I speak to you ! '"
宝钗 也 悄悄的 笑 道 ： “ 还 不快 做 上去 ， 只 姐姐 妹妹 的 ！,' Sister ! ' said Bao-chai with a little laugh . ' Stop fooling about and get on with your poem !
谁 是 你 姐姐 ？ 那 上头 穿 黄袍 的 才 是 你 姐姐 呢 。 ”,"That is your sister , sitting up there in the golden robe . I am no sister of yours ! '"
一面 说 笑 ， 因怕 他 耽延 工夫 ， 遂 抽身 走开 了 。,"Fearing that he would waste more time if she stayed , she slipped quietly away ."
宝玉 续成 了 此 首 ， 共有 三首 。,"The poem finished , Bao-yu had now completed three out of the four commanded ."
此时 黛玉 未 得展 才 ， 心上 不快 。,"At this point Dai-yu , who was still full of dissatisfaction because her talent had been underemployed , noticed that Bao-yu was struggling and came over to the table at which he was working ."
因见 宝玉 构思 太苦 ， 走 至 案 旁 ， 知 宝玉 只少 “ 杏帘 在 望 ” 一首 ， 因 叫 他 抄录 前 三首 ， 却 自己 吟成 一律 ， 写 在 纸条 上 ， 搓成 个 团子 ， 掷 向宝玉 跟前 。,"Observing that ' The Hopeful Sign ' still remained to be done , she told him to get on with the copying out in fair of the three poems he had already completed while she thought of something for ' The Hopeful Sign ' . When she had completed a poem in her head , she scribbled it out on a piece of paper , screwed it into a little ball , and tossed it in front of him ."
宝玉 打开 一 看 ， 觉比 自己 做 的 三首 高 得 十倍 ， 遂 忙 恭 楷 誊 完 呈 上 。,Bao-yu smoothed it out on the table and read it through . It seemed to him to be ten times better than the ones he had written himself . He copied it out in neat kai-shu after the other three and handed the finished task to Yuan-chun for her inspection .
元妃 看道 是 ：,This is what she read :
有凤来仪,The Phoenix Dance
宝玉,
秀玉初 成实 ，,"Perfected now at last , this place is fu"
堪宜 待 凤凰 。,For Bird of Paradise to enter it .
竿 竿 青欲滴 ，,Each graceful wand let's fall a dewy tear ;
个个 绿生凉 。,Each glossy leaf breathes coolness on the air .
迸砌 防阶水 ，,Through narrow-parted blocks the pent stream leaps ;
穿 帘碍 鼎香 。,Through chinks ef blind the incense thinly seeps .
莫摇分 碎影 ，,Let none the checkered shade with violence rude
好 梦 正 初长 。,"Disrupting , on the slumberer 's dreams intrude !"
蘅 芷 清芬,The Garden of Spices
蘅 芜满 静苑 ，,Fragrance of flower-drifts in these quiet confines
萝 薜 助 芬芳 。,"Mingles with headier scents of eglantines ,"
软 衬 三 春草 ，,"And summer 's herbs in a soft , spicy bed"
柔 拖 一缕 香 。,Their aromatic perfumes subtly spread .
轻烟迷 曲径 ，,"Light mist half screens the winding walks from view ,"
冷翠 湿 衣裳 。,Where chilly verdure soaks the clothes with dew .
谁 谓 “ 池塘 曲 ” ，,"Here , slumbering quietly at the fountain 's side ,"
谢家 幽梦 长 。,The dreaming poet all day long may bide .
怡红 快 绿,The House of Green Delights
深 庭长 日 静 ，,"In this quiet plot , where peace reigns through the year ,"
两两 出 婵娟 。,Bewitching ladies rank on rank appear :
绿 蜡 春 犹卷 ，,"Some wear in spring green waxen sheaths curled tight ,"
红妆 夜 未眠 。,"Some carmine caps , that are not doffed at night ."
凭栏 垂 绛 袖 ，,"Some from the trellis trail their purple sleeves ,"
倚 石护清 烟 。,"Some lean on rocks , where thin mists cool their leaves ."
对立 东风里 ，,"Their Mistress , standing in the soft summer breeze ,"
主人 应 解怜 。,Finds quiet content in everything she sees .
杏帘 在 望,The Hopeful Sign
杏帘 招客 饮 ，,"An inn-sign , through the orchards half-discerned"
在 望有 山庄 。,Promises shelter and a drink well-earned .
菱 荇 鹅 儿 水 ，,Through water-weeds the pond 's geese make their way ;
桑榆 燕子 梁 。,Midst elms and mulberry-trees the swallows play .
一 畦 春 韭熟 ，,The garden 's chives are ready to prepare ;
十里 稻 花香 。,The scent of young rice perfumes all the air .
盛世 无 饥馁 ，,"When want is banished , as in times like these ,"
何须 耕织 忙 。,The spinner and the ploughman take their ease .
元妃 看毕 ， 喜之 不尽 ， 说 ： “ 果然 进益 了 ！ ”,Yuan-chun was genuinely delighted . ' You really have made progress ! ' she said .
又 指 “ 杏帘 ” 一首 为 四首 之 冠 ， 遂 将 “ 浣 葛 山庄 ” 改为 “ 稻香村 ” 。,She singled out ' The Hopeful Sign ' as the best of the four and changed the name Washbrook Farm ' back to ' Sweet-rice Village ' by way of acknowledgement .
又 命 探春 将 方才 十数 首诗 ， 另以 锦笺 誉出 ， 令 太监 传 与 外厢 。,She made Tan-chun copy all ten poems - Bao-yu 's and the girls ' - on to a sheet of fancy paper and sent a eunuch to show it to the gentlemen outside .
贾政 等 看 了 ， 都 称颂 不已 。 贾政又 进 《 归省 颂 》 。,"Jia Zheng and the others were very complimentary , and Jia Zheng presented a eulogy of his own composition entitled The Visitation ."
元妃 又 命以 琼 酪金 脍 等 物 ， 赐与 宝玉 并 贾兰 。,"Yuan-chun also ordered Bao-yu and Jia Lan to be given presents of junket and mince , both of some special kind only made in the Imperial kitchens ."
— — 此时 贾兰 尚幼 ， 未谙 诸事 ， 只不过 随 母依叔 行礼 而已 。,At this period Jia Lan was still only a very little boy and did not really know what was going on . He was taken by his mother Li Wan into Yuan-chun 's presence and stood beside his uncle Bao-yu to make his little bow of thanks .
那时 贾蔷 带领 一班 女 戏子 在 楼下 ， 正 等得 不耐烦 ， 只见 一个 太监 飞跑 下来 ， 说 ： “ 做 完 了 诗 了 ， 快 拿 戏单 来 ！ ”,"All this time Jia Qiang and his troupe of girl players had been waiting impatiently below for an order to begin their performance . Just as they were reaching a peak of impatience , a eunuch came running down to them . ' They have finished writing poems , ' he said . ' Quick , give me a play-bill ! '"
贾蔷忙 将 戏目 呈 上 ， — — 并 十二个 人 的 花名册 子 。,"Jia Qiang hurriedly handed him a list of the pieces they had rehearsed , together with a brochure containing the stage names of each of the twelve players and some notes on the parts which each of them played ."
少时 ， 点 了 四出戏 ： 第一 出 ， 《 豪宴 》 ； 第二 出 ， 《 乞巧 》 ； 第三 出 ， 《 仙缘 》 ， 第四 出 ， 《 离魂 》 。,"Four pieces were chosen : ' Shi-fan Entertains ' from The Handful of Snou , ' The Double Seventh ' from The Palace of Eternal Youth , ' The Meeting of the Immortals ' from The Han-dan Road and ' Li-niang 's death-scene ' from The Return of the Soul ."
贾蔷忙 张罗 扮演 起来 ， 一个个 歌有 裂石 之 音 ， 舞 有 天魔 之 态 ， 虽是 妆演 的 形容 ， 却 做 尽 悲欢 的 情状 。,"Jia Qiang supervised the preparations , and soon the rock-splitting little voices and spellbinding movements of the actresses had taken over , and the stage was full of passions which were no whit less overwhelming for being counterfeit ."
刚 演完 了 ， 一个 太监 托 着 一 金盘 糕点 之 属 进来 ， 问 ： “ 谁 是 龄 官 ？ ”,"No sooner had they finished than a eunuch came round , bearing a variety of fancy cakes and sweetmeats on a gilded salver . ' Which is "" Charmante "" ? ' he asked , referring to the stage name of the little soubrette who had played the part of Li-niang 's maid in The Return of the Soul and a dashing young huntsman in the play within a play in The Handful of Snow ."
贾蔷便 知 是 赐 龄 官 之 物 ， 连忙 接 了 ， 命龄 官 叩头 。,"Jia Qiang realized that the confectionery was a present for the little actress , and taking the salver from the eunuch , made Mademoiselle Charmante come forward and kotow her thanks ."
太监 又 道 ： “ 贵妃 有 谕 ， 说 ： ‘ 龄 官 极好 ， 再 做 两出 戏 ， 不拘 那 两出 就是 了 。 ’ ”,"' Her Grace says that she enjoyed Mademoiselle Charmante 's performance the most and would like to see her in two more pieces , ' said the eunuch . ' She may choose any two she likes . '"
贾蔷忙 答应 了 ， 因 命龄 官 做 《 游园 》 《 惊梦 》 二 出 。,"Having replied to the eunuch , Jia Qiang told Charmante that she ought to play two more pieces from The Return gf the Soul : The Walk in the Garden ' and ' The Dream ' ."
龄 官 自 为此 二 出非 本角 之 戏 ， 执意不从 ， 定要 做 《 相约 》 《 相骂 》 二 出 。,"But neither had a part suitable for a soubrette in it , and Charmante obdurately refused . She said she would do ' The Assignation ' and ' The Altercation ' from The Bracelet and the Comb , in which the part of the pert young maidservant would allow her comic talent a fuller scope ."
贾蔷扭 不过 他 ， 只得 依 他 做 了 。,Jia Qiang failed to talk her out of this decision and had to let her do as she wished .
元妃 甚 喜 ， 命 ： “ 莫难 为了 这 女孩子 ， 好生 教习 。 ”,"Yuan-chun was delighted , and gave special instructions that Charmante was to be well treated and to have the best possible training ."
额外 赏 了 两匹 宫绸 ， 两个 荷包 ， 并 金 银锞子 之类 。,"She also awarded her , over and above her share of the presents that the whole troupe would receive in commemoration of her visit , two dress-lengths of tribute satin , two embroidered purses , and some miniature gold and silver ingots ."
然后 撤 筵 ， 将 未 到 之处 ， 复 又 游玩 。,"The feast was now cleared away and Yuan-chun recommenced her tour of the garden , visiting those places which she had not had time to look at before dinner ."
忽 见 山环 佛寺 ， 忙 盥手 进去 焚香 拜佛 ， 又题 一 匾 云 ： “ 苦 海慈航 ” ； 又 额外 加恩 与 一班 幽尼 女道 。,"When they came to the little convent nestling under its hill , she washed her hands and entered the shrine-hall to offer incense and pray before the image of the Buddha . She also wrote an inscription for the board which hung above the image : THE SHIP OF MERCY ON THE SEA OF SUFFERING and gave instructions for various extra presents to be bestowed on the little nuns in addition to those which , along with all the other members of the household , they were already due to receive in commemoration of her visit ."
少时 ， 太监 跪启 ： “ 赐 物 俱 齐 ， 请验 按 例行 赏 。 ” 乃 呈 上 略 节 。,A list for the latter had already been drawn up and presently it was submitted to Yuan-chun by a kneeling eunuch for her approval .
元妃 从头 看 了 无话 ， 即 命 照此 而 行 。,After reading through it in silence she approved its contents and asked that they should be distributed forthwith .
太监 下来 ， 一一 发放 。,The presents distributed were as follows :
原来 贾母 的 是 金玉如意 各一 柄 ， 沉香 拐杖 一根 ， 伽楠 念珠 一串 ， “ 富贵 长春 ” 宫 缎 四匹 ， “ 福寿绵长 ” 宫 䌷 四匹 ， 紫金 “ 笔锭 如意 ” 锞 十锭 ， “ 吉庆 有余 ” 银锞 十锭 。,"To Grandmother Jia : one golden ru-yi sceptre one jade ditto a staff of carved aloeswood a rosary of putchuk beads four lengths of ' Fu Gui Chang Chun ' tribute satin four lengths of ' Fu Shou Mian Chang ' tribute silk ten medallions of red gold with a design showing an ingot , a writing-brush and a sceptre ( which in the riddling rebus-language used by the makers of such objects meant ' All your heart 's desire ' ) ten silver medallions with a design showing a stone-chime flanked by a pair of little fish ( carrying the rebus-message ' Blessings in abundance ' )"
邢夫人 等 二分 ， 只 减 了 如意 、 拐 、 珠 四样 。,"Lady Xing , Lady Wang and Aunt Xue each received the same selection of gifts as Grandmother Jia with the omission of the sceptres , staff and rosary ."
贾敬 、 贾 赦 、 贾政 等 每 分 御制 新书 二部 ， 宝墨二 匣 ， 金银 盏 各 二只 ， 表礼 按 前 。,"To Jia Jing , Jia She and Jia Zheng ( each ) : two new books of His Imperial Majesty 's own composition two boxes of ink-sticks ( collector 's pieces ) two solid gold wine-cups two solid silver ditto silks and satins as above ."
宝钗黛 玉诸 姊妹 等 ， 每人 新书 一部 ， 宝砚 一方 ， 新 样 格式 金银 锞 二 对 。,"To Bao-chai , Dai-yu , Ying-chun , Tan-chun and Xi-chun ( each ) : one new book one inkstone ( collector 's piece ) two specially designed medallions in gold two ditto in silver"
宝玉 和 贾兰 是 金银 项圈 二个 ， 金银 锞 二 对 。,To Bao-yu and Jia Lan ( each ) : one gold necklet one silver ditto two gold medallions two silver ditto
尤氏 、 李 纨 、 凤姐 等 皆 金银 银 四锭 ， 表礼 四端 。,"To You-shi , Li Wan and Xi-feng ( each ) : two gold medallions two silver ditto four dress-lengths of tribute silk"
另有 表礼 二十四 端 ， 清 钱 五百 串 ， 是 赏 与 贾母王 夫人 及 各 姊妹 房中 奶娘 众 丫鬟 的 。,"( Also twenty-four lengths of silk and one hundred strings of unmixed Imperial Mint copper cash for the women-servants and maids in attendance on Grandmother Jia , Lady Wang and the girls )"
贾珍 、 贾琏 、 贾环 、 贾蓉 等 皆 是 表礼 一端 ， 金银 锞 一对 。,"To Cousin Zhen , Jia Lian , Jia Huan and Jia Rong ( each ) : one length of tribute satin one gold medallion one silver ditto"
其余 彩缎 百匹 ， 白银 千两 ， 御 酒 数瓶 ， 是 赐 东西 两府 及 园中 管理 工程 、 陈设 、 答应 及 司戏 、 掌灯 诸人 的 。 外 又 有 清 钱 三百 串 ， 是 赐 厨役 、 优伶 、 百戏 、 杂 行人 等 的 。,"There were also a hundred bales of variegated satins , a thousand taels of silver and an unspecified number of bottles of Palace wine for the senior servants of the Rong and Ning Mansions and Separate Residence responsible for construction and maintenance , attendance , theatre management , and lighting , and an additional five hundred strings of unmixed Imperial Mint copper cash for the cooks , entertainers and Miscellaneous ."
众人 谢恩 已 毕 ， 执事 太监 启道 ： “ 时 已 丑 正 三刻 ， 请 驾 回銮 。 ”,"When all had expressed their thanks , one of the eunuchs in charge announced that it was a quarter to three and time for Her Grace to return to the Palace ."
元妃 不由 的 满眼 又 滴下 泪 来 ， 却 又 勉强 笑 着 ， 拉 了 贾母王 夫人 的 手 不忍 放 ， 再 四 叮咛 ： “ 不须 记挂 ， 好生 保养 ！,"At once Yuan-chun 's eyes filled with tears , and even though she forced herself to smile , she was unable to prevent a few drops from falling . Clinging to Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang as if she would never let them go , she begged them again and again not to grieve for her . ' Now you must not worry about me , my dears : just look after yourselves !"
如今 天恩 浩荡 ， 一月 许进 内 省视 一次 ， 见面 尽 容易 的 ， 何必 过 悲 ？,"Thanks to the Emperor 's kindness , we are now allowed visits in the Palace once a month : so you see we can see each other quite easily . It is silly of us to be so upset !"
倘 明岁 天恩 仍许 归省 ， 不可 如此 奢华 糜费 了 。 ”,"And if His Majesty is gracious enough to permit another Visitation next year , you really must not be so extravagant again on my account ! '"
贾母 等 已 哭 的 哽噎 难言 。,Grandmother Jia and the others were now sobbing audibly and were much too overcome to reply .
元妃 虽 不忍 别 ， 奈 皇家 规矩 ， 违错 不得 的 ， 只得 忍心 上舆 去 了 。,"But Yuan-chun , however hard it was to leave her family , dared not infringe the regulations of the Imperial Household , and steeled herself to re-enter the palanquin which was to carry her away ."
这里 众人 好容易 将 贾母 劝住 ， 及 王夫人 搀扶 出园 去 了 。,"It was all the rest of the family could do to restrain Grandmother Jia from making a scene , and when she was somewhat calmed , she and Lady Wang had to be led weeping from the garden in a state of near-collapse ."
未知 如何 ， 下回分解 。,What followed will be told in the next chapter .
第十九回,Chapter 19
情 切切 良宵 花解语,A very earnest young woman offers counsel by night
意 绵绵 静日 玉生香,And a very endearing one is found to be a source of fragrance by day
话 说 贾妃 回宫 ， 次日 见 驾 谢恩 ， 并 回奏 归省 之 事 ， 龙颜 甚 悦 ， 又 发 内 帑 彩 缎 金银 等物 ， 以 赐 贾政 及 各 椒 房 等 员 ， 不必 细说 。,"On the day following the Imperial Concubine 's return to the Palace , she called on the Emperor to offer thanks and gave him a full account of her Visitation . The Emperor was visibly pleased by her report and commanded that bounties of gold , silver and silks should be issued to Jia Zheng and the other fathers of visiting ladies by the Inner Treasury . But there is no need for us to pursue these matters in further detail ."
且说 荣宁 二府 中 连日 用尽 心力 ， 真是 人 人力 倦 ， 各 各神疲 ； 又 将 园中 一应 陈设 动用 之物 收拾 了 两三天 方 完 。,"The events of the last few days had taxed the energies of all the inmates of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo mansions to the utmost , and by now all of them were feeling both physically and mentally exhausted . Even so , Xi-feng forced herself to supervise the taking down and storing away of all the decorations and other movables from the garden - an operation which took another two or three days to accomplish ."
第一个 凤姐 事 多 任 重 ， 别人 或 可 偷闲躲静 ， 独 他 是 不能 脱得 的 ； 二则 本性 要强 ， 不肯 落人 褒贬 ， 只 扎挣 着 与无事 的 人 一样 。,"Xi-feng 's duties and responsibilities were so many that she could not evade them and seek recuperation in rest and quiet as the others did . At the same time , however , the anxiety to be thought well of and the shrinking fear of criticism that were a part of her nature made her take pains , even when she was at her busiest , to appear outwardly as idle and unoccupied as the rest ."
第一个 宝玉 是 极 无 事 最 闲暇 的 。,"Of those idle and unoccupied rest , the idlest and most unoccupied was Bao-yu ."
偏 这 一早 ， 袭 人 的 母亲 又 亲来 回过 贾母 ， 接袭 人家 去 吃 年 茶 ， 晚上 才 得 回来 。,"On this particular morning , Aroma 's mother had been round first thing to report to Grandmother Jia that she was taking her daughter home for a New Year 's party and would not be bringing her back until late that evening ."
因此 ， 宝玉 只 和 众 丫头 们 掷骰子 赶 围棋 作戏 。,"After her departure Bao-yu played ' Racing Go ' with the other maids . This was a game in which you moved your Go-piece across the board in accordance with the throw of dice , the object being to reach the opposite side before everyone else and pocket all the stakes ."
正在 房内 玩 得 没 兴头 ， 忽 见 丫头 们 来回 说 ： “ 东府里 珍 大爷 来 请 过去 看戏 ， 放 花灯 。 ”,"He was already tired of sitting indoors and was beginning to find the game boring , when one of the maids told him that someone had just been round from Cousin Zhen 's inviting him over to the other house to see their New Year lanterns and to join them in watching some plays ."
宝玉 听 了 ， 便 命换 衣裳 。,Bao-yu told the maids to fetch his going-out clothes and help him change .
才 要 去 时 ， 忽 又 有 贾妃 赐 出糖 蒸酥 酪来 ； 宝玉 想 上次 袭 人 喜 吃 此物 ， 便 命留 与 袭 人 了 ， 自己 回过 贾母 ， 过去 看戏 。,"As he was on the point of leaving , someone arrived with a present of sweetened koumiss from the Imperial Concubine . He remembered how much Aroma had enjoyed this drink last time they had had some , and asked them to put it by for her ."
谁 想 贾珍 这边 唱 的 是 《 丁郎 认父 》 、 《 黄伯 央大 摆 阴魂 阵 》 ， 更 有 《 孙行者 大闹天宫 》 、 《 姜太公 斩 将 封神 》 等类 的 戏文 。,"Then , having first called on Grandmother Jia to tell her he was leaving , he went over to the other house to watch the players . The plays they were performing turned out to be very noisy ones : Ding-lang Finds His Father ; Huang Bo-yang and the Ghostly Army , Monkey Makes War in Heaven and The Investiture of the Gods ."
倏尔 神鬼 乱 出 ， 忽 又 妖魔 毕露 。 内中 扬 幡 过会 、 号 佛 行香 、 锣鼓 喊叫 之 声 ， 闻 于 巷外 。,"All of them , but especially the last two , seemed to involve much rushing in and out of supernatural beings , and the sound of drums and cymbals and blood-curdling battle-cries , as they whirled into combat across the stage with banners flying and weapons flashing or invoked the names of the Buddha with waving of burning joss-sticks , was positively deafening ."
〈 满街 之 人 个个 都 赞 “ 好 热闹 戏 ， 别人 家 断 不能 有 的 。 ” 〉,"It carried into the street outside , where the passersby smiled appreciatively and told each other that only a family like the Jias could afford theatricals that produced so satisfying a volume of noise ."
独有 宝玉 见 那 繁华 热闹 到 如此 不堪 的 田地 ， 只 略 坐 了 一 坐 ， 便 走 往 各处 闲 耍 。,"To Bao-yu , however , a little of this kind of thing was more than enough , and after sitting for a short while with the rest , he drifted off to seek his amusement elsewhere ."
先是 进 内 去 和 尤氏 并 丫头 姬 妾 说 笑 了 一回 ， 便 出 二门 来 。 尤氏 等 仍料 他 出来 看戏 ， 遂 也 不曾 照管 。,"To begin with he went inside and spent some time in bantering conversation with You-shi and the maids and concubines in the women 's quarters . When he went off once more through the inner gate , the women assumed that he was going back to the play and made no attempt to detain him ."
贾珍 、 贾琏 、 薛蟠 等 只顾 猜谜 行令 ， 百般 作乐 ， 纵 一时 不见 他 在座 ， 只道 在 里边 去 了 ， 也 不 理论 。,"The menfolk - Cousin Zhen , Jia Lian , Xue Pan and the rest - were engrossed in games of guess-fingers and other convivial aids to drunkenness , and if they noticed his absence at all , assumed that he was inside with the ladies and did not comment on it ."
至于 跟 宝玉 的 小厮 们 ： 那 年纪 大些 的 ， 知 宝玉 这一来 了 必是 晚上 才 散 ， 因此 偷 空儿 也 有 会 赌钱 的 ， 也 有 往 亲友 家 去 的 ， 或 赌 或 饮 ， 都 私自 散 了 ， 待 晚上 再 来 ； 那些 小 些 的 ， 都 钻进 戏 房里 瞧热闹 儿 去 了 。,"As for the pages who had accompanied him : the older ones , estimating that he had almost certainly come over for the day , gave themselves time off to gamble and drink with their cronies or to visit friends and relations outside , confident that if they returned in the evening they would be in time for Bao-yu 's departure . The younger ones wormed their way into the green-room to watch the excitement and get in the way of the actors ."
宝玉 见 一个 人 没有 ， 因想 ： “ 素日 这里 有个 小 书房 内 曾 挂 着 一 轴 美 人 ， 画 的 很 得 神 。,"Bao-yu was left without a single one of them in attendance . Finding himself alone , he began thinking about a certain painting he remembered having seen in Cousin Zhen 's ' smaller study ' . It was a very life-like portrait of a beautiful woman ."
今日 这般 热闹 ， 想 那里 自然 无人 ， 那 美 人 也 自然 是 寂寞 的 ， 须 得 我 去 望慰 他 一回 。 ”,"While everyone was celebrating , he reflected , she was sure to have been left on her own and would perhaps be feeling lonely ."
想着 ， 便 往 那里 来 。,He would go and have a look at her and cheer her up .
刚 到 窗前 ， 〈 闻 得 房内 有 呻吟 之 韵 〉 。,"But as he approached the study , he experienced a sudden thrill of fright . A gentle moaning could be heard coming from inside it ."
宝玉 倒 唬 了 一 跳 ， 心想 ： “ 美 人 活 了 不成 ？ ”,' Good gracious ! ' he thought . ' Can the woman in the painting really have come to life ? '
"乃 大 着 胆子 ， 舐 破 窗纸 ， 向 内 一看 ， — — 那 轴 美 人 却不曾 活 ， 却是 茗 烟 按着 个 女孩子 ， 也 干 那 警幻 所训 之 事 ［ , 正在 得趣 ， 故此 呻吟 ］ 。","He made a tiny hole in the paper window with his tongue and peeped through . It was no painted lady he saw , stepped down from her hanging scroll upon the wall , but Tealeaf , pressed upon the body of a girl and evidently engaged in those exercises in which Bao-yu had once been instructed by the fairy Disenchantment ."
宝玉 禁不住 大叫 ： “ 了不得 ！ ” 一脚 踹 进门 去 ， 将 两个 唬 的 抖衣而颤 。,"' Good lord ! ' He cried out involuntarily , and kicking open the door , strode into the study , so startling the two inside that they shook in their clothes ."
茗 烟 见 是 宝玉 ， 忙 跪下 哀求 。,"Seeing that it was Bao-yu , Tealeaf at once fell upon his knees and begged for mercy ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 青天白日 ， 这 是 怎么 说 ！,' In broad daylight ! ' said Bao-yu . ' What do you think you are at ? '
珍 大爷 要 知道 了 ， 你 是 死 是 活 ？ ”,"If Mr Zhen got to hear of this , it would be more than your life is worth . '"
一面 看 那丫头 ， 倒 也 白白净净 儿 的 有些 动 人心 处 ， 在 那里 羞 的 脸红耳赤 ， 低首 无言 。,"As he spoke , his eye fell upon the girl . She had a soft , white skin , to whose charms he could not be insensible . At the moment she was red to the very tips of her ears and stood there in silence , hanging her head with shame ."
宝玉 跺脚 道 ： “ 还 不快 跑 ？ ”,Bao-yu stamped his foot impatiently : ' Why do not you go ? '
一 语 提醒 ， 那丫头 飞跑 去 了 。,"The words seemed to bring her to herself , for she turned and fled immediately ."
宝玉 又 赶出去 叫 道 ： “ 你 别怕 ， 我 不 告诉 人 。 ”,"Bao-yu ran after her , shouting : ' Do not be afraid ! I will not tell anyone ! '"
急 的 茗 烟 在 后 叫 ： “ 祖宗 ， 这 是 分明 告诉 人 了 ！ ”,"Tealeaf , running out behind him , was frantic : ' My dear little grandfather , that is exactly what you are doing ! '"
宝玉 因 问 ： “ 那丫头 十几岁 了 ？ ”,' How old is she ? ' Bao-yu asked him .
茗 烟道 ： “ 不过 十六七 了 。 ”,"' Not more than fifteen or so , ' said Tealeaf ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 连 他 的 岁数 也 不 问问 ， 就 作 这个 事 ， 可见 他 白 认得 你 了 ！,"' You do not even know her age ! ' said Bao-yu . ' You can do this to her without even knowing her age ! She is wasted on you , that is evident ."
可怜 ， 可怜 ！ ”,Poor girl !
又 问 ： “ 名字 叫 什么 ？ ”,What is her name ? '
茗 烟 笑 道 ： “ 若 说出 名字 来话 长 ， 真正 新鲜 奇文 ！,"' Ah now , that is quite a story , ' said Tealeaf with a broad smile ."
— — 他 说 他 母亲 养 他 的 时节 ， 做 了 一个 梦 ， 梦得 一匹 锦 ， 上面 是 五色 富贵 不断 头 的 ‘ 卍 ’ 字 花样 ， 所以 他 的 名字 叫做 万儿 。 ”,"' She says that just before she was born her mother dreamed she saw a beautiful piece of brocade , woven in all the colours of the rainbow , with a pattern of lucky swastikas all over it . So when she was born , she gave her the name "" Swastika "" ' ."
宝玉 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 想必 他 将来 有些 造化 。,"Bao-yu smiled back . ' She ought to have a lucky future ahead of her , then ."
等 我 明儿 说 了 给 你 作 媳妇 ， 好不好 ？ ”,Shall I ask them tomorrow if you can have her for your wife ? '
茗 烟 也 笑 了 。,Tealeaf thought this was a huge joke .
因 问 ： “ 二爷 为何 不 看 这样 的 好戏 ？ ”,"' Why are not you watching the plays , Master Bao ? ' he asked . ' They are ever so good ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 看 了 半日 ， 怪烦 的 ， 出来 逛逛 ， 就 遇见 你们 了 。,"' I did watch for quite a while , ' said Bao-yu , ' but I got rather deafened and came out to walk around for a bit . That is how I found you here ."
— — 这 会子 作 什么 呢 ？ ”,But what are we going to do now ? '
茗 烟 微微 笑 道 ： “ 这 会子 没 人 知道 ， 我 悄悄的 引 二爷 城外 逛去 ， 一会儿 再 回 这里 来 。 ”,Tealeaf gave a sly little smile : ' What about going for a ride outside the city ? If we slipped off quietly we could get there and back without anyone knowing . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 不好 ， 看 仔细 花子 拐 了 去 。,"' Too risky , ' said Bao-yu . ' We might get kidnapped or something ."
况且 他们 知道 了 ， 又 闹 大 了 。,"Besides , there would be terrible trouble if they found out ."
不如 往近 些 的 地方 去 ， 还 可 就 来 。 ”,"It would better be somewhere nearer , so that we can get back quickly . '"
茗 烟道 ： “ 就近 地方 谁家 可 去 ？,Who do we know near here that we could call on ? ' said Tealeaf .
这 却 难 了 。 ”,' I can not think of anyone . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 依 我 的 主意 ， 咱们 竟 找 花大姐姐 去 ， 瞧 他 在家 作 什么 呢 。 ”,"' I know , ' said Bao-yu . ' Why do not we go round to the Huas ' house and see what Aroma is up to ? '"
茗 烟 笑 道 ： “ 好 ， 好 ！,' All right .
倒 忘 了 他家 。 ”,"But I have forgotten where they live , ' said Tealeaf untruthfully ."
又 道 ： “ 他们 知道 了 ， 说 我 引着 二爷 胡 走 ， 要 打 我 呢 ？ ”,"' And suppose they do find out you have been gadding around outside ' ( he added the real reason for his hesitation ) they will say I put you up to it , and I shall get a beating . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 有 我 呢 ！ ”,"' I will see you do not get into trouble , ' said Bao-yu ."
茗 烟 听说 ， 拉 了 马 ， 二人 从 后门 就 走 了 。,"Reassured , Tealeaf fetched the horse , and the two of them slipped out by the back entrance ."
幸而 袭 人家 不远 ， 不过 一半 里 路程 ， 转眼 已 到 门前 。,"Luckily the Huas ' house was only a few hundred yards from the Ning-guo mansion , and in no time at all they had reached its gate ."
茗 烟 先进 去 叫 袭 人 之 兄 花自芳 。,"Tealeaf entered first and called out the name of Aroma 's elder brother , Hua Zi-fang ."
此时 袭 人 之 母 接 了 袭 人 与 几个 外甥 女儿 几个 侄女儿 来家 ， 正 吃 果茶 ， 听见 外面 有人 叫 “ 花 大哥 ” ， 花自芳 忙 出去 看 时 ， 见 是 他 主仆 两个 ， 唬 的 惊疑 不定 ， 连忙 抱 下 宝玉 来 ， 至 院内 嚷 道 ： “ 宝二爷 来 了 ！ ”,"Aroma 's mother was not long back from collecting the various nieces , on both her own and her late husband 's side of the family , who had had to be fetched after she had been to call for Aroma , and the family had only just settled down to their tea when they heard this voice outside calling for Hua Zi-fang . To the latter 's considerable surprise and mystification he found , on going outside to look , his sister 's young master waiting at the gate with a servant . Having first lifted Bao-yu off his horse , he went back into the courtyard and bawled to the rest inside : ' It is Master Bao ! '"
别人 听见 还 可 ， 袭 人 听 了 ， 也 不知 为何 ， 忙 跑 出来 迎 着 宝玉 ， 一把 拉 着 问 ： “ 你 怎么 来 了 ？ ”,Aroma was dumbfounded and came running out to discover the cause of this unaccountable visit . As soon as she saw him she clung to him anxiously : ' What is it ? Are you all right ? '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 怪闷 的 ， 来 瞧瞧 你 作 什么 呢 。 ”,"Bao-yu laughed carelessly . ' I was just feeling bored , so I came over to see what you were up to . '"
袭 人 听 了 ， 才 把 心放 下来 ， 说道 ： “ 你 也 胡闹 了 ！,"' Stupid ! ' said Aroma , relieved to find that nothing was amiss ."
可 作 什么 来 呢 ？ ”,' What did you think I would be up to ? '
一面 又 问 茗 烟 ： “ 还有 谁 跟 了 来 了 ？ ”,She turned to Tealeaf . ' Who else is with you ? '
茗 烟 笑 道 ： “ 别人 都 不 知道 。 ”,"' Nobody , ' said Tealeaf with a grin . ' Nobody else knows we are here . '"
袭 人 听 了 ， 复 又 惊慌 道 ： “ 这 还 了得 ！,At this Aroma became alarmed once more . ' That is terrible !
倘若 碰见 人 ， 或是 遇见 老爷 ， 街上 人 挤 马 碰 ， 有个 失闪 ， 这 也 是 玩得 的 吗 ？,"Suppose you were to run into someone ? Suppose you were to meet the Master ? ' She glanced at Bao-yu fearfully . ' In any case , the streets are so crowded now , you could easily get ridden down or something . It would be no joke if you were to have an accident ."
你们 的 胆子 比斗 还 大 呢 ！,You two certainly have a nerve ! ' She turned to Tealeaf again .
— — 都 是 茗 烟 调唆 的 ； 等 我 回去 告诉 嬷嬷 们 ， 一定 打 你个 贼死 。 ”,"' You put him up to this , did not you ? Wait till I get back : I will tell his nannies about you . They will have you flogged like a felon , see if they do not ! '"
茗 烟 撅 了 嘴 道 ： “ 爷 骂 着 打着 叫 我 带 了 来 的 ， 这 会子 推到 我 身上 。,Tealeaf pulled a face . ' Do not go trying to pin the blame on me ! Master Bao was cursing and swearing at me to make me go with him .
我 说 别 来 罢 ！,I kept telling him not to come .
— — 要 不 ， 我们 回去 罢 。 ”,"Anyway , we would better be going back now , if that is the way you feel ! '"
花自芳 忙 劝道 ： “ 罢了 ， 已经 来 了 ， 也 不用 多 说 了 。,"' You might as well stay , now you are here , ' said Hua Zi-fang in a conciliatory manner . ' There is no point in quarrelling about it ."
只是 茅檐 草舍 ， 又 窄 又 不 干净 ， 爷 怎么 坐 呢 ？ ”,"The only trouble is , this is not much of a place we live in here : poor and cramped and not too clean and that . Hardly a fit place for the likes of Master Bao , I am thinking . '"
袭 人 的 母亲 也 早 迎 出来 了 。,By this time Aroma 's mother had joined them outside to welcome the visitors .
袭 人 拉 着 宝玉 进去 。,Aroma took Bao-yu by the hand and led him in .
宝玉 见 房中 三五个 女孩儿 ， 见 他 进来 ， 都 低 了 头 ， 羞 的 脸上 通红 。,He saw four or five girls sitting down inside who hung their heads and blushed when he entered .
花自芳 母子 两个 恐怕 宝玉 冷 ， 又 让 他 上 炕 ， 又 忙 另 摆 果子 ， 又 忙 倒好 茶 。,"Despite their blushes , Hua Zi-fang and his mother insisted that Bao-yu should get up on the kang with them , as they were afraid that he would find their house cold . Having installed him on the kang , they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pouring tea ."
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 你们 不用 白忙 ， 我 自然 知道 ， 不敢 乱 给 他 东西 吃 的 。 ”,"' Now do not you two rush about , Mother , ' said Aroma . ' I know how to look after him . There is no point in your giving him a lot of things he will not be able to eat . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 将 自己 的 坐褥 拿 了 来 ， 铺 在 一个 机子 上 ， 扶 着 宝玉 坐下 ， 又 用 自己 的 脚炉 垫 了 脚 ， 向 荷包 内 取出 两个 梅花香 饼儿 来 ， 又 将 自己 的 手炉 掀开 焚上 ， 仍 盖 好 ， 放在 宝玉 怀里 ， 然后 将 自己 的 茶杯 斟 了 茶 ， 送与 宝玉 。,"As she said this she took her own cushion that she had been sitting on , put it on top of a little short-legged kang table , and made Bao-yu sit on it with his feet on her metal foot-warmer . Then she took a couple of rose-shaped perfume lozenges from a little purse she was wearing , opened up her hand-warmer , popped the lozenges onto the burning charcoal , and closing it up again , stuffed it into the front of his gown . Having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction , she served him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup"
彼时 他 母兄 已是 忙 着 齐齐整整 的 摆上 一 桌子 果品 来 ， 袭 人 见 总 无可 吃之物 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 既 来 了 ， 没有 空 回去 的 理 ， 好歹 尝 一点儿 ， 也 是 来 我家 一趟 。 ”,"Hua Zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea . The cakes , nuts and dried fruits were arranged on their plates , and the plates themselves on the table , with painstaking attention to symmetry and design . Aroma could tell at a glance that there was nothing there which Bao-yu could possibly be expected to eat . But her family must not be offended . ' Since you have decided to come , ' she said to Bao-yu with a smile . ' we can not let you go without having tasted something of ours . You will have to try something , just to be able to say that you have been our guest ! '"
说 着 ， 捻 了 几个 松 瓢 ， 吹 去 细皮 ， 用 手帕 托 着 给 他 。,"She took a handful of pine nuts from one of the dishes on the table , and blowing away the skins , handed them to him on her handkerchief ."
宝玉 看见 袭 人 两眼 微红 ， 粉光 融滑 ， 因悄 问 袭 人 道 ： “ 好好 的 哭 什么 ？ ”,Bao-yu noticed that Aroma 's eyes were slightly red and that there were recent tear-stains on her powdered cheeks . ' Why have you been crying ? ' He spoke the words in an undertone as she handed him the pine nuts .
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 谁 哭 来 着 ？,' Who is been crying ? ' said Aroma with a feigned laugh .
才 迷了眼 揉 的 。 ”,' I have just been rubbing my eyes . '
因此 便 遮掩 过 了 。,"Her little fiction was successful , for he made no further comment ."
因见 宝玉 穿着 大红 金蟒 狐腋箭袖 ， 外罩 石青 貂裘 排穗 褂 ， 说道 ： “ 你 特为 往 这里 来 ， 又 换 新 衣裳 ， 他们 就 不问 你 往 那里 去 吗 ？ ”,"Bao-yu was wearing his dark-red gown with the pattern of golden dragons and white fox-fur lining , and a sable-lined slate-blue jacket with fringed edges . ' Fancy ! ' said Aroma , ' you got yourself all dressed up just to come and see us . Did not anyone ask you where you were going ? '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 原是 珍 大爷 请 过去 看戏 换 的 。 ”,"' No , ' said Bao-yu . ' Actually I changed because I was going to Cousin Zhen 's . He invited me over to watch the players . '"
袭 人 点头 ， 又 道 ： “ 坐 一 坐 就 回去 罢 ； 这个 地方 儿 不是 你 来得 的 。 ”,"Aroma nodded . ' You would better go back after you have sat a bit longer , ' she said . ' This is really no place for you here . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 就 家 去 才 好 呢 ， 我 还 替 你 留 着 好 东西 呢 。 ”,"' You should not be too long , either , ' said Bao-yu with a smile . ' I have got something nice waiting for you when you get back ."
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 悄悄儿 的 罢 ！ 叫 他们 听 着 作 什么 ？ ”,' Sh ! ' said Aroma . ' Do you want them all to hear you ? '
一面 又 伸手 从 宝玉 项 上将 “ 通灵玉 ” 摘下来 ， 向 他 姊妹 们 笑 道 ： “ 你们 见识 见识 。,"As she said this , she reached out and took the Magic Jade from his neck . ' Here 's something that will interest you all , ' she said , holding it out to the others ."
时常 说 起来 都 当 稀罕 ， 恨不能 一 见 ， 今儿 可 尽力 儿 瞧瞧 。,"' You know how often you have spoken about that wonderful jade of Master Bao 's and said how much you would give for a look at it ? Well , here it is ! Now you can look to your heart 's content ."
再 瞧 什么 稀罕物 儿 ， 也 不过 是 这么着 了 。 ”,"There you are , that is all it is ! Not so wonderful , really , is it ? '"
说 毕 ， 递 与 他们 传看 了 一遍 ， 仍 与 宝玉 挂 好 ， 又 命 他 哥哥 去 雇 一辆 干干净净 、 严严 紧紧 的 车 ， 送 宝玉 回去 。,"They passed it from hand to hand , and when it had gone full circle and all had examined it , she hung it once more round his neck . Aroma told her elder brother to go out and hire the cleanest , smartest-looking cab he could find to take Bao-yu home in ."
花自芳 道 ： “ 有 我 送 去 ， 骑马 也 不妨 了 。 ”,' I can see him safely back ; ' said Hua Zi-fang . ' He will not come to any harm on horseback '
袭 人 道 ： “ 不 为 不妨 ， 为的是 碰见 人 。 ”,"' It is not a question of whether he will come to any harm or not , ' said Aroma . ' I am afraid someone might see him . '"
花自芳 忙 去 雇 了 一辆车 来 ， 众人 也 不好 相留 ， 只得 送 宝玉 出去 。,"Hua Zi-fang hurried out to hire a cab . The rest of the company , realizing that Bao-yu had no real business to be there , made no effort to detain him and rose to see him off ."
袭 人 又 抓 些 果子 给 茗 烟 ， 又 把 些 钱 给 他 买 花 爆放 ， 叫 他 ： “ 别 告诉 人 ， 连 你 也 有 不是 。 ”,Aroma snatched up a handful of sweetmeats for Tealeaf . She also gave him a few coppers to buy fireworks with . ' Mind you do not tell anyone about this visit ! ' she said . ' You will be in trouble yourself if they find out about it . '
一面 说 着 ， 一直 送 宝玉 至 门前 ， 看着 上车 ， 放 下车 帘 。,"She escorted Bao-yu to the gate and saw him into the cab , pulling the blind down on him as soon as he was inside ."
茗 烟 二人 牵马 跟随 。,Tealeaf and her brother followed behind it with the horse .
来 至 宁府街 ， 茗 烟命 住车 ， 向 花自芳 道 ： “ 须 得 我 和 二爷 还 到 东府里 混一 混 ， 才 过去 得 呢 ， 看 人家 疑惑 。 ”,"When they arrived outside the Ning-guo mansion , Tealeaf told the cabbie to stop . ' We would better go in here for a bit before going home , ' he explained to Aroma 's brother . Otherwise they might get suspicious . '"
花自芳 听说 有理 ， 忙 将 宝玉 抱 下车 来 ， 送 上马 去 。,"Hua Zi-fang acknowledged the sense of this precaution , and lifting Bao-yu from the cab , helped him up on to his horse ."
宝玉 笑 说 ： “ 倒 难 为 你 了 。 ” 于是 仍 进 了 后门 来 ， 俱 不在话下 。,"' Thank you for your trouble , ' said Bao-yu with a winning smile as he rode into the rear gate of the Ning-guo mansion . And there , for the time being , we shall leave him ."
却说 宝玉 自 出了门 ， 他 房中 这些 丫鬟 们 都 索性 恣意 的 玩笑 ， 也 有 赶 围棋 的 ， 也 有 掷 骰抹 牌 的 ， 磕 了 一地 的 瓜子皮 儿 。,"When Bao-yu left his room for the other mansion , his maids were free to do exactly as they liked and threw themselves into their amusements with great abandon . Some played at Racing Go , some at Dice and Dominoes . Everywhere a litter of the spat-out skins of melonseeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence ."
偏 奶母 李嬷嬷 拄 拐进来 请安 ， 瞧瞧 宝玉 ， 见 宝玉 不 在家 ， 丫鬟 们 只顾 玩闹 ， 十分 看 不过 ， 因 叹道 ： “ 自从 我 出去 了 不大 进来 ， 你们 越发 没 了 样儿 了 ； 别的 嬷嬷 越 不敢 说 你们 了 。,"It was unfortunate that Nannie Li should have chosen such a moment to come stomping in , stick in hand , to call on Bao-yu and to inquire how he was getting on . She could see that Bao-yu was out , and the uproar created in his absence by the maids was deeply offensive to her . ' Now that I have left service and do not come in very often , she said with a sigh , you girls have got worse than ever . The other nannies can do nothing with you ."
那宝玉 是 个 ‘ 丈八 的 灯台 ， — — 照见 人家 ， 照 不见 自己 ’ 的 ， 只 知 嫌人家 腌臜 。 这 是 他 的 房子 ， 由着 你们 遭塌 ， 越 不成体统 了 。 ”,"And as for Bao-yu : he is like a six-foot lampstand that lights up others but stays dark itself ; for he is always on about how dirty other people are , but look at the mess he allows you to make of his own room ! It is a disgrace ! '"
这些 丫头 们 明知 宝玉 不 讲究 这些 ； 二则 李嬷嬷 已 是 告老 解 事 出去 的 了 ， 如今 管不着 他们 。,Now the maids all knew that Bao-yu did not care about such matters . They also knew that Nannie Li was pensioned off now and had no more power over them .
因此 ， 只顾 玩笑 ， 并 不理 他 。,They therefore continued with their fun and took no notice of her .
那 李嬷嬷 还 只管 问 ： “ 宝玉 如今 一顿 吃 多少 饭 ？,But Nannie Li was not to be ignored . ' How is Bao-yu eating nowadays ?
什么 时候 睡觉 ？ ”,' What time does he go to bed ? '
丫头 们 总 胡乱 答应 ， 有 的 说 ： “ 好 个 讨厌 的 老货 ！ ”,"She plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all . One of them even said , quite audibly and in her hearing , ' Old nuisance ! '"
李嬷嬷 又 问道 ： “ 这 盖碗 里 是 酪 ， 怎么 不 送给 我 吃 ？ ”,"' What is in this covered bowl ? ' Nannie Li went on . ' It is junket , is not it ? Why do not you offer it to me ? '"
说 毕 ， 拿起 就 吃 。,She picked up the gift of koumiss and began to drink it .
一个 丫头 道 ： “ 快 别动 ！,' Do not you touch that ! ' said one of the maids .
那 是 说 了 给 袭 人 留 着 的 ， 回来 又 惹气 了 。,' He was keeping that for Aroma . He will be angry when he gets back and finds out about that .
你 老人家 自己 承认 ， 别 带累 我们 受气 。 ”,You would better tell him yourself you took it . We do not want you getting us into trouble ! '
李嬷嬷 听 了 ， 又 气 又 愧 ， 便 说道 ： “ 我 不信 他 这么 坏 了 肠子 ！ 别说 我 吃 了 一碗 牛奶 ， 就是 再 比 这个 值钱 的 ， 也 是 应该 的 。,"Nannie Li was angry and embarrassed at one and the same time . ' I will not believe it of him , ' she said . ' I will not believe he would be so wicked as to grudge his old Nannie a bowl of milk . Why , he owes it to me . And not only a bowl of milk , either . Much more precious things than that ."
难道 待 袭 人 比 我 还 重 ？,Do you mean to tell me that Aroma counts for more with him than I do ?
难道 他 不 想想 怎么 长大 了 ？,He ought to stop and ask himself how he grew up to be the big boy he is today .
我 的 血 变 了 奶 ， 吃 的 长 这么 大 ； 如今 我 吃 他 碗 牛奶 ， 他 就 生气 了 ？,"It is my milk he sucked , that came from my own heart 's blood : that is what he grew up on . And you mean to tell me that now , if I drink one little bowlful of his milkcow 's milk - he is going to be angry with me ?"
我 偏 吃 了 ， 看 他 怎么着 ！,"Well , I will drink it , so there ! He can do what he likes about it ."
你们 看袭 人不知 怎么样 ， 那 是 我 手里 调理 出来 的 毛丫头 ， 什么 阿物儿 ！ ”,And as for that Aroma . I do not know what sort of a wonderful creature you think she is - a little bit of a girl I picked out myself and trained with my own hand ! '
一面 说 ， 一面 赌气 把 酪全 吃 了 。,Defiantly she applied the koumiss once more to her lip and downed it to the last gulp .
又 一个 丫头 笑 道 ： “ 他们 不会 说话 ， 怨不得 你 老人家 生气 。,"One of the maids , politer than the rest , attempted to placate her : ' They should not talk to you like that , Nannie ! I am not surprised you are cross ."
宝玉 还 送 东西 给 你 老人家 去 ， 岂 有 为 这个 不自在 的 ？ ”,Of course Bao-yu is not going to upset himself over a little thing like that . He is much more likely to send something nice round to you when he hears that you have been to see him . '
李嬷嬷 道 ： “ 你 也 不必 妆 狐媚 子 哄 我 ， 打量 上次 为 茶 撵 茜 雪 的 事 我 不 知道 呢 ！,"' Do not you try wheedling me with your airs and graces , young woman ! ' said Nannie Li implacably . ' You think I do not know about Snowpink being dismissed that time over the tea ?"
明儿 有 了 不是 ， 我 再 来 领 。 ”,"You need not worry . If he makes a fuss about it tomorrow , I shall take the blame . '"
说 着 ， 赌气 去 了 。,She went off in dudgeon .
少时 ， 宝玉 回来 ， 命人 去 接袭 人 ， 只见 晴雯 躺 在 床上 不 动 ， 宝玉 因 问 ： “ 可是 病 了 ？,Presently Bao-yu returned and sent someone off to fetch Aroma . He noticed Skybright lying motionless on the day-bed . ' What is the matter with her ? ' he asked . ' Is she ill ?
还是 输 了 呢 ？ ”,Or has she lost the game ? '
秋纹 道 ： “ 他 倒 是 赢 的 ； 谁知 李 老太太 来 了 混输 了 ， 他 气 的 睡去 了 。 ”,"' She was winning , ' said Ripple . ' Then Nannie Li came along and put her off her stroke and she started losing . She got so cross that she had to go and lie down . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你们 别 和 他 一般见识 ， 由他去 就是 了 。 ”,"' You should not all take the old girl so seriously , ' said Bao-yu . ' Just leave her to do as she likes and take no notice ! '"
说 着 ， 袭 人 已来 ， 彼此 相见 。,Just at that moment Aroma arrived and said ' hullo ' to everyone .
袭 人 又 问宝玉 何处 吃饭 ， 多早晚 回来 ； 又 代母 妹问 诸 同伴 姊妹 好 。,She asked Bao-yu where he had eaten and what time he had got back . She also gave her mother 's regards to the other maids .
一时 换衣 卸妆 。 宝玉 命取 酥酪 来 ， 丫鬟 们 回说 ： “ 李 奶奶 吃 了 。 ”,"When she had finished changing out of her holiday attire and taken the ' going-out ' ornaments from her hair , Bao-yu asked someone to fetch the koumiss . There was a chorus of replies from the maids : ' Nannie Li drank it ! '"
宝玉 才 要 说话 ， 袭 人 便 忙 笑 说道 ： “ 原来 留 的 是 这个 ， 多谢 费心 。 前儿 我 因为 好吃 ， 吃 多 了 ， 好 肚子疼 ， 闹 的 吐 了 才 好 了 。,"Bao-yu was about to say something when Aroma cut in with a smile : ' So that is what you were saving for me ! It was a very kind thought ; but last time I had some of that stuff I took too much , being so fond of it , and gave myself a terrible stomachache . It did not go away until I would brought it all up again , and it is put me off it ever since ."
他 吃 了 倒好 ， 搁 在 这里 白 遭塌 了 。,It is a good job really that she did drink it . It would only have got left around and gone bad .
我 只 想 风干 栗子 吃 ， 你 替 我 剥 栗子 ， 我 去 铺 炕 。 ”,"Now what I would really fancy are some dried chestnuts , if you would like to be peeling them for me while I make up your bed on the kang . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 信以为真 ， 方 把 酥酪 丢开 ， 取 了 栗子 来 ， 自 向 灯 下检 剥 。,"Bao-yu was completely taken in by this little ruse , and forgetting all about the koumiss , went off for some chestnuts and sat down by the lamp to peel them ."
一面 见 众人 不在 房中 ， 乃 笑 向 袭 人 道 ： “ 今儿 那个 穿 红 的 是 你 什么 人 ？ ”,"He and Aroma were now alone in the room together . Glancing up with a smile from his peeling he said , ' What relation of yours was that girl in the red dress today ? '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 那 是 我 两 姨 姐姐 。 ”,' That is my mother 's sister 's child . '
宝玉 听 了 ， 赞叹 了 两声 。,Bao-yu made appreciative noises .
袭 人 道 ： “ 叹 什么 ？,"' What are you "" oo-ing "" and "" ah-ing "" about ? ' said Aroma ."
我 知道 你 心里 的 缘故 ， 想 是 说 ： 他 那里 配穿 红 的 ？ ”,"' No , do not tell me ! I know how your mind works . You think she is not good enough to wear red . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 不是 ， 不是 。,"' No. On the contrary , ' said Bao-yu ."
那样 的 人 不配 穿 红 的 ， 谁 还 敢 穿 ？,"' If she is not good enough to wear red , I should not think anyone is ."
我 因为 见 他 实在 好 的 很 ， 怎么 也 得 他 在 咱们 家 就 好 了 。 ”,"No , I was merely thinking what a beautiful girl she is and how nice it would be if we could have her to live with us here . '"
袭 人 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 一个 人 是 奴才 命 罢了 ， 难道 连 我 的 亲戚 都 是 奴才 命 不成 ？,"' Because I have the misfortune to be a slave , ' Aroma said bitterly , ' does that mean that all my relations ought to be slaves too ?"
定 还要 拣 实在 好 的 丫头 才 往 你们 家 来 ？ ”,I suppose you think every pretty girl you see is just waiting to be bought so that she can be a servant in your household ! '
宝玉 听 了 ， 忙 笑 道 ： “ 你 又 多心 了 ！,' How touchy you are ! ' said Bao-yu .
我 说 往 咱们 家 来 ， 必定 是 奴才 不成 ， 说 亲戚 就 使不得 ？ ”,"' Having her to live with us does not have to mean as a servant , does it ? It could mean as a bride . '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 那 也 搬 配不上 。 ”,"' Thank you , I am sure ! ' said Aroma . ' But my folk are not quite grand enough for that ! '"
宝玉 便 不肯 再说 ， 只是 剥 栗子 。,Bao-yu was unwilling to pursue a conversation that had become so unpleasant and went on peeling in silence .
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 怎么 不 言语 了 ？,' Why do not you say something ? ' said Aroma .
想 是 我 才 冒 撞 冲犯 了 你 ？,' I suppose I have upset you now .
明儿 赌气 花 几两 银子 买进 他们 来 就是 了 。 ”,"Well , never mind ! Tomorrow you can go out and buy the lot of them , just to spite me ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 说 的话 怎么 叫 人 答言 呢 ？,"' I do not see what answer I can give when you say things like that , ' said Bao-yu ."
我 不过 是 赞 他 好 ， 正 配生 在 这 深宅大院 里 ， 没 的 我们 这 宗 浊物 倒生 在 这里 ！ ”,"' I only said what a nice girl she was . I think she is exactly suited to live in a big , wealthy household like ours . Much more so than some of the lumbering idiots who do live here . '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 他 虽 没 这样 造化 ， 倒 也 是 姣生 惯养 的 ， 我 姨父 姨娘 的 宝贝儿 似的 ， 如今 十七岁 ， 各样 的 嫁妆 都 齐备 了 ， 明年 就 出嫁 。 ”,"' She may not have that much good fortune , ' said Aroma ; ' but for all that she has been very delicately brought up - the apple of my aunt 's and uncle 's eye . She was seventeen this holidays , and her trousseau is all ready for her to be married next year . '"
宝玉 听 了 “ 出嫁 ” 二 字 ， 不禁 又 “ 瞎 ” 了 两声 。,' Hai ! ' An involuntary expression of regret broke from him when he heard that the girl in red was to be married .
正 不自在 ， 又 听 袭 人 叹 道 ： “ 我 这 几年 ， 姊妹 们 都 不大 见 ， 如今 我 要 回去 了 ， 他们 又 都 去 了 ！ ”,"Already Aroma 's words had made him uneasy ; but worse was to follow . ' I haven ' t been able to see much of my cousins during these last few years , she said with a sigh , and now it looks as if they will all have left home when I do go back . '"
宝玉 听 这话 里 有 文章 ， 不觉 吃 了 一惊 ， 忙 扔下 栗子 ， 问道 ： “ 怎么着 ， 你 如今 要 回去 ？ ”,"There was obviously a good deal more that lay behind this remark . Startled , he threw down the chestnut he was peeling and asked her : ' How do you mean , ' when you do go back ' ? '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 我 今儿 听见 我 妈 和 哥哥 商量 ， 教 我 再 耐 一年 ， 明年 他们 上来 就 赎出 我 去 呢 。 ”,"' Today I heard my mother discussing it with my elder brother . They want me to hold out this one year more , then next year they will see about buying me out of service . '"
宝玉 听 了 这话 ， 越发 忙 了 ， 因 问 ： “ 为什么 赎 你 呢 ？ ”,Bao-yu was becoming more and more alarmed . ' Why should they want to buy you out of service ? '
袭 人 道 ： “ 这话 奇 了 ！,"' Well upon my word , that is a funny question to ask ! ' said Aroma ."
我 又 比 不得 是 这里 的 家 生子儿 ， 我们 一家子 都 在 别处 ， 独 我 一个 人 在 这里 ， 怎么 是 个 了 手 呢 ？ ”,"' I am not one of your house-born slaves , my family lives elsewhere . I am the only member of my family away from home . There is no future for me here . Naturally I want to rejoin them . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 不 叫 你 去 也 难 哪 ！ ”,"' You can not if I will not let you , ' said Bao-yu ."
袭 人 道 ： “ 从来没 这个 理 。,' I never heard of such a thing ! ' said Aroma :
就是 朝廷 宫里 ， 也 有 定例 ， 几年 一 挑 ， 几年 一 放 ， 没有 长远 留下 人 的 理 ， 别说 你们 家 ！ ”,"' Even in palace hall Law is the lord of all . A bond is a bond . When their term of service has ended , you have to let people go . You can not force them to stay in service for ever and ever - especially a household like yours . '"
宝玉 想一想 ， 果然 有理 ， 又 道 ： “ 老太太 要 不放 你 呢 ？ ”,Bao-yu thought a bit . What she said seemed reasonable enough . ' But suppose Grandmother will not let you ? '
袭 人 道 ： “ 为什么 不放 呢 ？,' Why should not she ? ' said Aroma .
我 果然 是 个 难得 的 ， 或者 感动 了 老太太 、 太太 不肯 放 我 出去 ， 再多 给 我们 家 几两 银子 留下 ， 也 还有 的 ； 其实 我 又 不过 是 个 最 平常 的 人 ， 比我强 的 多 而且 多 。,"If I were a very exceptional sort of person , it is quite possible that she and Her Ladyship might feel upset at the idea of losing me and offer my family money to let me stay on . But as it is I am only a very ordinary sort of maid . There are any number much better than me ."
我 从小儿 跟着 老太太 ， 先 伏侍 了 史 大姑娘 几年 ， 这 会子 又 伏侍 了 你 几年 ， 我们 家 要 来 赎 我 ， 正是 该 叫 去 的 ， — — 只怕 连 身价 不要 ， 就 开恩 放 我 去 呢 。,"I started off with Her Old Ladyship and served Miss Shi for a few years . Then I was transferred to you , and I have already been quite a few years with you . They would think it quite natural that my family should want to buy me out now . In fact , I would not be surprised if they let me go as a kindness without even asking for the money ."
要说 为 伏侍 的 你好 不 叫 我 去 ， 断然 没有 的 事 。,"If you think they would not let me go because I have served you so well , that is just ridiculous ."
那 伏侍 的 好 ， 是 分内 应当 的 ， 不是 什么 奇功 ； 我 去 了 仍旧 又 有 好 的 了 ， 不是 没 了 我 就 使不得 的 。 ”,Serving you well is no more nor less than what I am supposed to do . It is my job . There is nothing remarkable about that . There will be plenty of other good ones to take my place when I am gone . I am not irreplaceable . '
宝玉 听 了 这些 话 ， 竟是 有 去 的 理 ， 无留 的 理 ， 心里 越发 急 了 ， 因 又 道 ： “ 虽然 如此 说 ， 我 的 一心 要 留下 你 ， 不怕 老太太 不 和 你 母亲 说 ， 多多 给 你 母亲 些 银子 ， 他 也 不好意思 接 你 了 。 ”,"Everything Aroma said pointed to the reasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of her staying . A kind of desperateness began to seize him . ' That may be so , ' he said , ' but if I am absolutely determined to keep you , I am sure Grandmother would speak to your mother about it . If Grandmother had a talk with your mother and offered her a really large sum of money , surely she would not refuse ? '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 我 妈 自然 不敢 强 。,"' I am sure my mother would never insist , ' said Aroma ."
且慢 说 和 他 好 说 ， 又 多 给 银子 ； 就 便 不好 和 他 说 ， 一个 钱 也 不 给 ， 安心 要强 留下 我 ， 他 也 不敢 不依 。,"' And I do not only mean if you spoke to her and gave her a lot of money . Even if you did not speak to her about it and did not give her any money at all , but simply made up your minds to keep me here against my will and say nothing , I am sure she would not dare object ."
但 只是 咱们 家 从没 干 过 这 倚 势 仗 贵 霸道 的 事 。,"But your family has never gone in for throwing its weight about like that in the past , and I do not believe it is going to start doing so now ."
这 比 不得 别的 东西 ， 因为 喜欢 ， 加 十倍 利弄 了 来 给 你 ， 那 卖 的 人 不 吃亏 ， 就 可以 行得 的 ； 如今 无故 平空 留下 我 ， 于 你 又 无益 ， 反教 我们 骨肉分离 ， 这件 事 ， 老太太 、 太太 肯行 吗 ？ ”,"It would be different if I were just an object you d taken a fancy to and they could get it for you without any danger of upsetting the owner by simply offering him ten times the price . But I am not an object . If you were to keep me here without rhyme or reason against my will , you would not only be doing yourselves no good , you would be breaking up someone else 's family ; and that is something I am quite sure Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship would never be willing to do . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 思忖 半晌 ， 乃 说道 ： “ 依 你 说来说去 ， 是 去 定 了 ？ ”,"For some time Bao-yu reflected in silence . At last he spoke : ' The long and short of all this is that you are definitely going , is that right ? '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 去 定 了 。 ”,' Definitely . '
宝玉 听 了 自思道 ： “ 谁知 这样 一个 人 ， 这样 薄情无义 呢 ！ ”,' Who would have believed that so sweet a person could be so faithless and unfeeling ? ' he thought to himself .
乃 叹 道 ： “ 早 知道 都 是 要 去 的 ， 我 就 不该 弄 了 来 。 临 了 剩 我 一个 孤鬼 儿 ！ ”,"But all he said was : ' If I had known all along that in the end you would go away and leave me on my own , I should never have let you work for me in the first place . '"
说 着 便 赌气 上床 睡 了 。,And with those words he took himself off to bed in a thoroughly bad humour and composed himself for sleep .
原来 袭 人 在家 ， 听见 他 母兄 要 赎 他 回去 ， 他 就 说 ： “ 至死 也 不 回去 。 ”,"Now Aroma 's mother and elder brother had spoken earlier that day about their intention of buying her out of service , but Aroma had at once stated that she would never go back home as long as she lived ."
又 说 ： “ 当日 原 是 你们 没饭 吃 ， 就 剩 了 我 还 值 几两 银子 ， 要 不 叫 你们 卖 ， 没有 个 看着 老子 娘 饿死 的 理 ； 如今 幸而 卖 到 这个 地方 儿 ， 吃 穿 和 主子 一样 ， 又 不朝打暮骂 。 况 如今 爹 虽 没了 ， 你们 却 又 整理 的 家成业就 ， 复了 元气 。,"' When you sold me in the first place , ' she said , ' it was because you had nothing to eat and I was the only thing you had left in the house which was worth a bit of money . I could not have refused to go and watched my own mother and father starve . But now , fortunately , I have got a good situation - one in which I am not beaten and sworn at all day long and where I am fed and clothed as well as the masters themselves - and the rest of you , in spite of losing Father , have managed to get in the clear again and are as well off now as you have ever been ."
若 果然 还 艰难 ， 把 我 赎 出来 ， 再 多 掏摸 几个 钱 ， 也 还 罢了 ， 其实 又 不难 了 。,"If you were still hard up and wanted to buy me out so that you could raise a bit of money by reselling me , there would be some point in it . But you are not ."
— — 这 会子 又 赎 我 做 什么 ？,What do you want to buy me out for ?
权当 我 死 了 ， 再 不必 起 赎 我 的 念头 了 ！ ”,"Why do not you just pretend that I am dead , then you will not need to think about buying me out any more ? '"
因此 哭 了 一阵 。,And after that she had had a little cry .
他 母兄 见 他 这般 坚执 ， 自然 必不 出来 的 了 。,"Seeing her so adamant , her mother and brother had naturally resigned themselves to her continuing in service ."
况且 原是 卖倒 的 死契 ， 明仗 着 贾宅 是 慈善 宽厚 人家 儿 ， 不过 求求 ， 只怕 连 身价 银 一并 赏 了 还是 有 的 事 呢 ， 二则 贾府中 从 不曾 作践 下 人 ， 只有 恩多威 少 的 ， 且 凡 老少 房中 所有 亲侍 的 女孩子 们 ， 更 比待 家下 众人 不同 ， 平常 寒薄 人家 的 女孩儿 也 不能 那么 尊重 ： 因此 他 母子 两个 就 死心 不 赎 了 。,"They did so the more readily as Aroma 's contract was , in point of fact , for life . In seeking to redeem her they would have had to rely on the customary generosity of the Jias , who , as soon as they were approached on the subject , would in all probability restore not only the person of Aroma but also the body-price offered for her , but who were certainly not under any obligation to do so . Another consideration which predisposed them to let her stay was the well-known fact - already mentioned by Aroma - that the Jia household did not ill-treat its servants and relied more on kindness than coercion in its dealings with them . Indeed , the ' inside maids ' - those who , like Aroma , were in personal attendance on members of the family ( and this was true of allof them , no matter in whose apartment they were employed ) were the crême de la creme of the household staff and were even regarded as a cut above the free daughters of poorer households outside ."
次后 忽然 宝玉 去 了 ， 他 两个 又 是 那个 光景 儿 ， 母子 二人 心中 更 明白 了 ， 越发 一块 石头 落 了 地 ， 而且 是 意外 之 想 ， 彼此 放心 ， 再 无 别意 了 。,"Later , when Bao-yu unexpectedly arrived on the scene and they saw how it was between him and Aroma , the reason for her reluctance to leave service at once became apparent . It was a factor they had not foreseen ; but now they recognized it , it was a great weight off their minds , and it was not without feelings of relief that they abandoned all further thought of attempting to purchase her freedom ."
且说 袭 人 自幼儿 见 宝玉 性格 异常 ， 其 淘气 憨 顽 出于 众 小儿 之外 ， 更 有 几件 千奇百怪 口 不能 言 的 毛病 儿 。,"But to return to our story . Since early youth Aroma had always been aware that Bao-yu 's character was peculiar . His naughtiness and intractability exceeded those of normal boys , and in addition he had a number of extraordinary eccentricities of his own which she could scarcely even have put a name to ."
近来 仗 着 祖母 溺爱 ， 父母 亦 不能 十分 严紧 拘管 ， 更觉 放纵 弛荡 ， 任情 恣性 ， 最 不喜 务正 。 每 欲 劝 时 ， 谅 不能 听 。,"Recently he had taken advantage of the comparative immunity from parental control , afforded him by the all-encompassing protection of his doting grandmother , to become even more wild and self-indulgent and even more confirmed in his aversion to serious pursuits than in previous years , and all her attempts to remonstrate with him met with the same obstinate unwillingness to hear ."
今日 可巧 有 赎身 之 论 ， 故先 用 骗词 以 探 其 情 ， 以 压其气 ， 然后 好 下 箴规 。,"Today 's talk about buying her out of service turned out to be providential . By employing only a minimum of deceit , she could use it as a means of ascertaining his real feelings towards her and of humbling his spirit a little , so that he might be in a suitably chastened frame of mind for the lecture with which she was preparing to admonish him ."
今 见 宝玉 默默 睡 去 ， 知 其 情 不忍 ， 气 已 馁 堕 。,She judged from his going off silently to bed that he was shaken and a little unsure of himself .
,Evidently she had succeeded in the first part of her plan .
自己 原 不想 栗子 吃 ， 只因怕 为 酥酪 生事 ， 又 象 那茜雪 之 茶 ， 是 以 假要 栗子 为 由 ， 混 过 宝玉 不 提 就 完 了 。,Aroma had not really wanted the chestnuts . She had pretended to do so because she was afraid that the matter of the koumiss might blow up into an incident like the earlier one involving Snowpink and the tea . By pretending to want chestnuts she had deflected him from pursuing it further .
于是 命 小丫头 子 们 将 栗子 拿 去 吃 了 ， 自己 来 推 宝玉 。,"She now told the younger maids to take them away and eat them themselves , while she went over to rouse up Bao-yu ."
只见 宝玉 泪痕 满面 ， 袭 人 便 笑 道 ： “ 这 有 什么 伤心 的 ？,The face that he lifted from the pillow was wet with tears . ' Now what do you want to go upsetting yourself like that for ? ' she said with a smile .
你 果然 留 我 ， 我 自然 不肯 出去 。 ”,"' If you really want me to stay , of course I will not go . '"
宝玉 见 这话 头儿 活动 了 ， 便 道 ： “ 你 说 说 ， 我 还要 怎么 留 你 ？ 我 自己 也 难说 了 ！ ”,"Bao-yu at once brightened up . ' Tell me ! ' he said . ' Tell me what I must do to prove to you how much I want you to stay , since nothing I say myself seems any good ! '"
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 咱们 两个 的 好 ， 是 不用说 了 。,"' I know we are both fond of each other , ' said Aroma . ' That does not need any proving ."
但 你 要 安心 留 我 ， 不在 这 上头 。,"But if you want to be sure of my staying here , it must not only be because of that ."
我 另 说出 三件 事来 ， 你 果然 依了 ， 那 就是 真心 留 我 了 ， 刀 搁 在 脖子 上 ， 我 也 不 出去 了 。 ”,"There are three other things I want to talk to you about . If you will promise to obey me in all of them , I shall know that you really and truly want me to stay ; then nothing-not even a knife at my throat - will ever make me leave you ! '"
宝玉 忙 笑 道 ： “ 你 说 ， 那 几件 ？,' Tell me what they are ! ' he said impetuously .
我 都 依 你 。,I promise to obey you .
好 姐姐 ， 好 亲姐姐 ！,Dearest Aroma ! Sweetest Aroma !
别说 两三件 ， 就是 两三百 件 我 也 依 的 。,Never mind two or three : I would promise if it were two or three hundred !
只求 你们 看守 着 我 ， 等 我 有 一日 化成 了 飞灰 ， — — 飞灰 还 不好 ， 灰 还有 形有 迹 ， 还有 知识 的 。,"All I ask is that you should not leave me . If the day ever comes when nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash - no , not ash . Ash has form and substance and perhaps consciousness too ."
— — 等 我 化成 一股 轻 烟 ， 风 一 吹 就 散 了 的 时候 儿 ， 你们 也 管 不得 我 ， 我 也 顾不得 你们 了 ， 凭 你们 爱 那里 去 那里 去 就 完 了 。 ”,"Say smoke . A puff of thin smoke dissolved upon the wind . When that is all that remains of me , and you can no longer fuss over me because there is nothing left to fuss over , and I can no longer pay attention to you because there is nothing left to pay attention with - when that time comes , you may go or stay as you please ! '"
急的 袭 人 忙 握 他 的 嘴 ， 道 ： “ 好 爷 ， 我 正为 劝 你 这些 个 。 更 说 的 狠 了 ！ ”,"' My dear young gentleman , ' said Aroma exasperatedly , clapping her hand over his mouth to prevent him saying any more , ' it is precisely this way of carrying on that I was going to talk to you about , and here you go , ranting away worse than ever ! '"
宝玉 忙 说道 ： “ 再 不 说 这话 了 。 ”,"' Right , ' said Bao-yu . ' Right . I promise never to talk that way again . '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 这 是 头 一件 要改 的 。 ”,' That was the first thing I wanted you to reform .
宝玉 道 ： “ 改 了 ， 再说 你 就 拧 嘴 ！,"' I have reformed already , ' said Bao-yu . ' If I ever talk that way again , you can pinch my lips !"
还有 什么 ？ ”,Then what ? '
袭 人 道 ： “ 第二件 ， 你 真 爱 念书 也罢 ， 假 爱 也罢 ， 只 在 老爷 跟前 ， 或 在 别人 跟前 ， 你 别 只管 嘴里 混批 ， 只 作出 个 爱 念书 的 样儿 来 ， 也 叫 老爷 少生 点儿 气 ， 在 人 跟前 也好 说 嘴 。,"' The second thing is this , ' said Aroma . ' I do not care whether you really like studying or not , but even if you do not , I would like you at least to pretend that you do when you are with the Master or any other gentlemen , and not always be making sarcastic remarks about it . If you could only put on an appearance of liking it , he would have less cause to be angry with you , and could even take a bit of pride in you when he was talking to his friends ."
老爷 心里 想着 ： 我家 代代 念书 ， 只 从 有 了 你 ， 不 承望 不但 不 爱 念书 ， — — 已经 他 心里 又 气 又 恼 了 — — 而且 背前面后 混 批评 。,Look at it from his point of view . Every generation of your family up to now have been scholars . Then suddenly you come along . Not only do you hate studying - that is already enough to make him feel angry and upset - but on top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it - and not only behind his back but even when he is there .
凡 读书 上进 的 人 ， 你 就 起 个 外号 儿 ， 叫 人家 ‘ 禄 蠹 ’ ； 又 说 只 除了 什么 ‘ 明明 德 ’ 外 就 没书 了 ， 都 是 前人 自己 混 编纂 出来 的 。,"According to you anyone who studies and tries to improve himself is a "" career worm "" . According to you the Illumination of Clear Virtue or whatever it is called is the only genuine book ever written and all the rest are forgeries ."
— — 这些 话 ， 你 怎么 怨 得 老爷 不 气 ， 不 时时刻刻 的 要 打 你 呢 ？ ”,No wonder the Master gets so angry with you . No wonder he is every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a thrashing . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 再 不 说 了 。,Bao-yu laughed . ' All right . I will not say such things any more .
那 是 我 小时候 儿 不知 天 多 高地 多 厚 信口胡说 的 ， 如今 再 不敢 说 了 。,"In any case , these are all things I used to say when I was younger and did not know any better . I do not say things like that nowadays ."
还有 什么 呢 ？ ”,What else ? '
袭 人 道 ： “ 再 不许 谤 僧 毁道 的 了 。 还有 更 要紧 的 一件 事 ， 再 不许 弄 花儿 ， 弄 粉儿 ， 偷 着 吃 人 嘴上 擦 的 胭脂 ， 和 那个 爱红 的 毛病 儿 了 。 ”,' You must leave off forever going on about people 's appearance and interfering with their make-up-and you must give up that craze for everything red and that filthy habit of taking the lipstick from girl 's lips with your own mouth . That is most important ! '
宝玉 道 ： “ 都 改 ！ 都 改 ！,' I will reform ! I will reform !
再有 什么 快 说 罢 。 ”,"Is there anything else , now ? '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 也 没有 了 ， 只是 百事 检点 些 ， 不 任意 任性 的 就是 了 。,"' Nothing else , really . Just to be a bit more careful about things in general and not always letting yourself get carried away by your whims and fancies ."
你 要 果然 都 依 了 ， 就 拿 八 人 轿 也 抬不出 我 去 了 。 ”,"But if you will really keep your promise about these three things I have mentioned , I will promise never to leave you - even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry me away ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 这里 长远 了 ， 不怕 没八人轿 你 坐 。 ”,"' Oh , come now ! Is not that stretching it a bit ? ' said Bao-yu with a laugh . For eight bearers and a handsome husband I bet you would go ! '"
袭 人 冷笑 道 ： “ 这 我 可不 希罕 的 。 有 那个 福气 ， 没有 那个 道理 ， 纵坐 了 也 没趣儿 。 ”,"' It would not interest me in the least , ' said Aroma haughtily . ' "" Kind sir , for such blessing I am not willing . "" Even if I did go , I should take no pleasure in it . '"
二人 正说 着 ， 只见 秋纹 走进 来 ， 说 ： “ 三 更天 了 ， 该 睡 了 。,"Their dialogue was interrupted by Ripple , who just at that moment entered the room . ' It is nearly midnight , you two . You ought to be in bed ."
方才 老太太 打发 嬷嬷 来 问 ， 我 答应 睡 了 。 ”,Her Old Ladyship just now sent one of the nannies round to ask about you and I told her you were asleep . '
宝玉 命取 表 来看 时 ， 果然 针 已 指到 子 初二 刻 了 ， 方 从 新 盥漱 ， 宽衣 安歇 ， 不在话下 。,"Bao-yu asked for his watch and looked . The hand was pointing to half past eleven . He washed and cleaned his teeth all over again , and taking off his outer clothes , settled down once more to sleep"
至 次日 清晨 ， 袭 人 起来 ， 便 觉 身体 发重 ， 头疼 目胀 ， 四肢 火热 。,"When Aroma got up first thing next morning she felt heavy and unwell . Her head ached , her eyelids were puffy and her whole body was afire ."
先时 还 扎挣 的 住 ， 次 后 捱 不住 ， 只要 睡 ， 因而 和 衣 躺 在 炕上 。,"At first she dragged herself round performing her usual tasks , but eventually she could hold out no longer and had to lie down fully clothed on the kang ."
宝玉 忙 回 了 贾母 ， 传医 诊视 ， — — 说道 ： “ 不过 偶感 风寒 ， 吃 一 两剂 药 疏散 疏散 就 好 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu at once informed Grandmother Jia , who called in a doctor . Having taken Aroma 's pulses , the doctor informed them that she had ' merely contracted a severe chill and would be all right after taking a few doses of medicine to relieve the congestion , and left after writing a prescription ."
开方 去后 ， 令人 取药 来 煎 好 ， 刚 服下去 ， 命 他 盖 上 被窝 渥汗 ， 宝玉 自去 黛玉 房中 来看 视 。,"Bao-yu sent out for the materials prescribed , and when they had been duly boiled up and the first draught taken , made her cover herself with a quilt to bring on a perspiration . Then he went off to see Dai-yu ."
彼时 黛玉 自在 床上 歇 午 ， 丫鬟 们 皆 出去 自便 ， 满 屋内 静悄悄 的 。,Dai-yu was at that moment taking a midday nap . Her maids had all gone off about their own affairs . Not a sound could be heard from the inside room .
宝玉 揭起 绣线 软帘 ， 进入 里间 ， 只见 黛玉 睡 在 那里 ， 忙 上来 推 他 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 才 吃了饭 ， 又 睡觉 ！ ”,"As Bao-yu lifted the embroidered door-curtain and entered , he could see her lying asleep inside and hurried over to rouse her : ' Sleeping after you have just eaten , coz ? That is bad ! Wake up ! '"
将 黛玉 唤醒 。,His voice woke her .
黛玉 见 是 宝玉 ， 因 说道 ： “ 你 且 出去 逛逛 ， 我 前儿 闹 了 一夜 ， 今儿 还 没歇 过来 ， 浑身 酸疼 。 ”,She opened her eyes and saw that it was Bao-yu . ' Do go away and play for a bit ! I am so dreadfully tired . I did not get any sleep last night and I haven ' t been able to rest until now . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 酸疼 事 小 ， 睡 出来 的 病 大 ， 我 替 你 解闷 儿 ， 混过 困去 就 好 了 。 ”,"' Never mind how tired you are , ' said Bao-yu . ' You will do yourself much more harm by sleeping after a meal . I will stay and amuse you to keep you awake if you feel sleepy . '"
黛玉 只合 着眼 ， 说道 ： “ 我 不 困 ， 只 略 歇歇 儿 ， 你 且 别处 去 闹 会子 再 来 。 ”,"' I am not sleepy , I am tired . I want to rest for a bit . Can not you go and amuse yourself somewhere else for a few minutes and come back later ? '"
宝玉 推 他 道 ： “ 我 往 那里 去 呢 ， 见 了 别人 就 怪腻 的 。 ”,Bao-yu gave her another shake . ' Where else can I go ? ' he said . I am so bored with everyone else . '
黛玉 听 了 ， “ 嗤 ” 的 一 笑 道 ： “ 你 既要 在 这里 ， 那边 去 老老实实 的 坐 着 ， 咱们 说话 儿 。 ”,"' Chee-ee-ee ! ' Dai-yu exploded in a little laugh . ' All right . I suppose now you are here you may as well stay . You can sit very , very quietly over there and we will talk . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 也 歪 着 。 ”,"' I should prefer to lie down , ' said Bao-yu ."
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 就 歪 着 。 ”,"' All right , lie down then ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 没有 枕头 ， 咱们 在 一个 枕头 上 罢 。 ”,' There is not a pillow . We shall have to share yours . '
黛玉 道 ： “ 放屁 ！,' Do not be ridiculous ! ' said Dai-yu .
外头 不是 枕头 ？,Look at all those pillows in the next room .
拿 一个 来 枕着 。 ”,Why do not you get yourself one of them ? '
宝玉 出至 外间 ， 看 了 一看 ， 回来 笑 道 ： “ 那个 我 不要 ， 也 不知 是 那个 腌臜 老婆子 的 。 ”,"Bao-yu went into the outer room for a look but came back empty-handed . ' I do not want any of them , ' he said genially . ' How do I know some dirty old woman hasn ' t been sleeping on them ? '"
黛玉 听 了 ， 睁开眼 ， 起身 笑 道 ： “ 真真 你 就是 我 命中 的 ‘ 魔星 ’ ， — — 请 枕 这 一个 ！ ”,"Dai-yu opened her eyes very wide . ' You really are the bane of my life ! ' she said . Here , take this ! '"
说 着 ， 将 自己 枕 的 推给 宝玉 ， 又 起身 将 自己 的 再 拿 了 一个 来 枕上 ， 二人 对 着 脸儿 躺 下 。,"She pushed the pillow she had been lying on towards him and got up to fetch another one of her own to replace it with . The two of them then reclined , facing each other , at opposite ends of the bed ."
黛玉 一回 眼 ， 看见 宝玉 左边 腮 上 有 钮扣 大小 的 一块 血迹 ， 便 欠身 凑近 前来 ， 以 手抚 之 细看 道 ： “ 这 又 是 谁 的 指甲 划破 了 ？ ”,"Glancing up from her recumbent position , Dai-yu noticed that there was a blood-spot about the size of a small button on Bao-yu 's left cheek . She bent over him to examine it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger . ' Whose nails was it this time ? '"
宝玉 倒身 ， 一面 躲 ， 一面 笑 道 ： “ 不是 划 的 ， 只怕 是 才刚 替 他们 淘 澄 胭脂 膏子 溅 上 了 一点儿 。 ”,Bao-yu lay back to avoid her scrutiny and laughed . ' It is not a scratch . I have just been helping them make rouge . A little of it must have splashed on to my face . '
说 着 ， 便 找 绢子 要 擦 。,He rummaged for a handkerchief to wipe it off with .
黛玉 便 用 自己 的 绢子 替 他 擦 了 ， 咂 着 嘴儿 说道 ： “ 你 又 干 这些 事 了 。,"Dai-yu wiped it off with her own , clicking her tongue censoriously as she did so . ' So you are up to those tricks again ?"
— — 干 也罢 了 ， 必定 还要 带 出 幌子 来 。,You might at least refrain from advertising the fact !
就是 舅舅 看不见 ， 别人 看见 了 ， 又 当作 奇怪 事 新鲜 话儿 去 学舌 讨好 儿 ， 吹 到 舅舅 耳朵 里 ， 大家 又 该 不得 心净 了 。 ”,"Even if Uncle does not see you himself , someone else might who thought it an amusing story to go around gossiping about . He could easily get to hear about it in that way , and that would make it unpleasant for all of us . '"
宝玉 总 没 听见 这些 话 ， 只 闻见 一股 幽香 ， 却是 从 黛玉袖 中 发出 ， 闻之 令人 醉魂 酥 骨 。,But her words were lost on Bao-yu . He was preoccupied with a subtle fragrance which seemed to emanate from Dai-yu 's sleeve - a fragrance that intoxicated the senses and caused one to feel rather limp .
宝玉 一把 便 将 黛玉 的 衣袖 拉 住 ， 要 瞧瞧 笼 着 何物 。,He seized hold of the sleeve and demanded to know what perfume she was wearing .
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 〈 冬寒 十月 〉 ， 谁 带 什么 香 呢 ？ ”,' Perfume ? At this season ? ' said Dai-yu with a laugh . ' I am not wearing any . ' In the cold winter none smells sweet ' ! '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 那么 着 ， 这 香 是 那里 来 的 ？ ”,"' Well , where does it come from , then ? '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 连 我 也 不 知道 ， 想必 是 柜子 里头 的 香气 熏染 的 ， 也 未可知 。 ”,"' I do not know myself where it comes from , ' said Dai-yu . ' I suppose it might have come from the wardrobe . '"
宝玉 摇头 道 ： “ 未必 。 这 香 的 气味 奇怪 ， 不是 那些 香 饼子 、 香球 子 、 香袋 儿 的 香 。 ”,Bao-yu shook his head . ' I doubt it . It is a very unusual scent . Not the kind you would get from a scent-cake or a perfume-ball or sachet . '
黛玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 难道 我 也 有 什么 ‘ 罗汉 ’ ‘ 真人 ’ 给 我些 奇香 不成 ？,' I hope you do not imagine it is some exotic perfume given me by the Immortals of the Isles .
就是 得 了 奇香 ， 也 没有 亲哥哥 亲兄弟 弄 了 花儿 、 朵儿 、 霜儿 、 雪儿 替 我 炮制 。,"Even if I had the recipe , I have no kind elder brother to get together all those flowers and stamens and things and make it up for me ."
我 有的是 那些 俗 香 罢了 ！ ”,"I have got only the ordinary , vulgar sorts of perfume ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 凡 我 说 一句 ， 你 就 拉 上 这些 。,"' Whatever I say , you are always dragging in things like that , ' said Bao-yu ."
不 给你个 利害 也 不 知道 ， 从 今儿 可不 饶 你 了 ！ ”,"Very well , You will have to be taught a lesson . From now on , no mercy ! '"
说 着 翻身 起来 ， 将 两只手 呵 了 两口 ， 便 伸 向黛玉 膈 肢窝 内 两 胁 下 乱 挠 。,"Half rising , he pretended to spit on his hands , then stretching them out before him , began to waggle his fingers up and down in the region of her ribs and armpits ."
黛玉 素性 触痒 不禁 ， 见 宝玉 两手 伸来 乱 挠 ， 便 笑 的 喘 不过 气 来 ， 口里 说 ： “ 宝玉 ！,"Dai-yu had always been the most ticklish of mortals , and the mere sight of his waggling fingers sent her off into shrieks of laughter which soon ended in breathlessness : ' Oh ! Oh ! Bao-yu !"
你 再 闹 ， 我 就 恼 了 。 ”,No ! Stop ! I will be angry ! '
宝玉 方 住 了 手 ， 笑 问道 ： “ 你 还 说 这些 不 说 了 ？ ”,Will you say things like that any more ? '
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 再 不敢 了 。 ”,"' No , ' said Dai-yu , laughing weakly , ' I promise . '"
一面 理鬓 笑 道 ： “ 我 有 奇 香 ， 你 有 ‘ 暖 香 ’ 没有 ？ ”,"She proceeded to pat her hair into place , smilingly complacently : ' So I have got an unusual fragrance , have I ? Have you got a warm fragrance ? '"
宝玉 见 问 ， 一时 解不来 ， 因 问 ： “ 什么 ‘ 暖 香 ’ ？ ”,For the moment Bao-yu was puzzled : ' Warm fragrance ? '
黛玉 点头 笑 叹 道 ： “ 蠢才 ， 蠢才 ！,Dai-yu shook her head pityingly . ' Do not be so dense !
你 有 玉 ， 人家 就 有 金 来 配 你 ； 人家 有 ‘ 冷香 ’ ， 你 就 没有 ‘ 暖 香 ’ 去 配 他 ？ ”,"You have your jade . Somebody has a gold thing to match . Somebody has Cold Fragrance , ergo you must have Warm Fragrance to go with it ! '"
宝玉 方 听 出来 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 方才 告饶 ， 如今 更 说狠 了 ！ ”,"' I have only just let you off , ' said Bao-yu , ' and here you go again , worse than ever ! '"
说 着 又 要 伸手 。 黛玉忙 笑 道 ： “ 好 哥哥 ， 我 可 不敢 了 。 ”,Once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and Dai-yu again began to shriek . ' No ! Bao-yu ! Please ! I promise ! '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 饶 你 不难 ， 只 把 袖子 我 闻一闻 。 ”,"' All right , I forgive you . But you must let me smell your sleeve . '"
说 着 便 拉 了 袖子 笼 在 面上 ， 闻 个 不住 。,He wrapped the free end of that garment over his face and abandoned himself to long and prodigious sniffs .
黛玉 夺 了 手道 ： “ 这 可 该 去 了 。 ”,Dai-yu jerked away her arm . ' I really think you ought to go . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 要 去 不能 。 咱们 斯斯文文 的 躺 着 说话 儿 。 ”,' Could not go if I wanted to . Let's lie down very quietly and genteelly and have a conversation . '
说 着 复 又 躺 下 ， 黛玉 也 躺 下 ， 用 绢子 盖 上 脸 。,"And he stretched himself out again . Dai-yu lay down too , and covered her face with a handkerchief ."
宝玉 有一 搭 没一搭 的 说 些 鬼话 ， 黛玉总 不理 。,He tried to arouse her interest with desultory chat - talking for the sake of talking . Dai-yu took no notice .
宝玉 问 他 几岁 上京 ， 路上 见 何 景致 ， 扬州 有何 古迹 ， 土俗 民风 如何 ， 黛玉 不答 。,He tried asking questions . How old was she when she first came to the Capital ? What had the scenery been like on the journey ? What places of historical interest were there in Yangchow ? What were its inhabitants like ? What were its local customs ? Dai-yu made no reply .
宝玉 只怕 他 睡出 病来 ， 便 哄 他 道 ： “ 暧哟 ！,"Still concerned that she might fall asleep and injure her health , he tried a ruse . ' Why , yes ! ' he said , as if suddenly remembering something ."
你们 扬州 衙门 里 有 一件 大 故事 ， 你 可 知道 么 ？ ”,' There is a famous story that took place near Yangchow . I wonder if you know about it . '
黛玉 见 他 说 的 郑重 ， 又 且 正言厉色 ， 只当 是 真事 ， 因 问 ： “ 什么 事 ？ ”,This was delivered with so straight a face and in so serious a tone of voice that Dai-yu was quite taken in . ' Oh ? What ? '
宝玉 见 问 ， 便 忍 着 笑 ， 顺口 诌 道 ： “ 扬州 有 一座 黛山 ， 山上 有个 林子 洞 ， … … ”,"Mastering a strong inclination to laugh , he began to extemporize with whatever came into his head . ' Near the city of Yangchow there is a mountain called Mt Yu-dai , in the side of which is a cavern called the Cave of Lin . '"
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 这 就 扯谎 ， 自来 也 没 听见 这 山 。 ”,"' That is false , for a start , ' said Dai-yu . ' I have never heard of a mountain of that name . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 天下 山水 多着呢 ， 你 那里 都 知道 ？,"' There are a great many mountains in this world , said Bao-yu . ' You could hardly be expected to know all of them ."
等 我 说完 了 你 再 批评 。 ”,Leave your criticisms until I have finished my story . '
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 说 。 ”,"' Carry on , ' said Dai-yu ."
宝玉 又 诌 道 ： “ 林子 洞 里 原来 有 一群 耗子 精 。 那 一年 腊月初 七 老 耗子 升座 议事 ， 说 ： ‘ 明儿 是 腊八 儿 了 ， 世上 的 人 都 熬 腊八粥 ， 如今 我们 洞 里 果品 短少 ， 须 得 趁此 打劫 些个 来 才 好 。 ’,"' Now in the Cave of Lin there lived a tribe of magic mice , and one year , on the seventh day of the last month , the Oldest Mouse climbed up on to his throne and sat in council with the rest of the tribe . "" Tomorrow is Nibbansday , "" he said , "" and everywhere in the world of men they will be cooking frumenty . Since our cave is at present short of dry provender , we should take this opportunity of replenishing our stores by raiding theirs . """
乃拔 令箭 一枝 ， 遣 了 个 能干 小 耗子 去 打听 。,"He took a ceremonial arrow from the receptacle in front of him and handing it to an able younger mouse , instructed him to carry out a reconnaissance ."
小 耗子 回报 ： ‘ 各处 都 打听 了 ， 惟有 山下 庙里 果米 最 多 。 ’,"In due course the Able Younger Mouse came back and reported that , though he had looked positively everywhere , there were nowhere more plentiful stores to be found than in the temple at the foot of the mountain ."
老 耗子 便 问 ： ‘ 米 有 几样 ？ 果 有 几品 ？ ’,"' "" How many kinds of grain have they got there , and how many sorts of dried fruits ? "" the Oldest Mouse asked him ."
小 耗子 道 ： ‘ 米 豆 成仓 。 果品 却 只有 五样 ： 一 是 红枣 ， 二 是 栗子 ， 三 是 落花生 ， 四 是 菱角 ， 五 是 香芋 。 ’,"' "" There is a whole granary full of rice and beans , "" replied the Able Younger Mouse , "" but only five kinds of dried fruits : the first , red dates the second , chestnuts the third , peanuts the fourth , caltrops the fifth , sweet potatoes . '"
老 耗子 听 了 大喜 ， 即时 拔 了 一枝 令箭 ， 问 ： ‘ 谁 去 偷 米 ？ ’,"' The Oldest Mouse was highly delighted , and picking up another arrow , he said , "" Who will go to steal rice ? """
一个 耗子 便 接令 去 偷 米 。,' A mouse at once took the arrow and went off to steal rice .
又 拔 令箭 问 ： ‘ 谁 去 偷 豆 ？ ’,"' "" ...Who will go to steal beans ? "" he asked , picking up another arrow ."
又 一个 耗子 接令 去 偷 豆 。,' Another mouse took the arrow and went off to steal beans .
然后 一一 的 都 各 领令 去 了 。 只 剩下 香芋 。,' One by one they departed on their missions until only the sweet potatoes had still to be arranged for
因 又 拔 令箭 问 ： ‘ 谁 去 偷 香芋 ？ ’,"' The Oldest Mouse took up another arrow . ' "" ...Who will go to steal sweet potatoes ? """
只见 一个 极小 极弱 的 小 耗子 应道 ： ‘ 我 愿 去 偷 香芋 。 ’,"' A little puny , weak mouse replied , ' "" I will ! """
老 耗子 和 众耗 见 他 这样 ， 恐 他 不 谙练 ， 又 怯懦 无力 ， 不准 他 去 。,"' Seeing how young and puny he was , the Oldest Mouse and the other members of the mousey tribe feared that he would be too lacking in training and experience and too timid and weak to carry out the task , and refused to let him go ."
小 耗子 道 ： ‘ 我 虽 年 小 身 弱 ， 却是 法术 无边 ， 口齿伶俐 ， 机谋 深远 。,"But the little mouse said , ' "" Although I am young in years and weak in body , I am eloquent and resourceful and possess unlimited magic powers ."
这一 去 ， 管比 他们 偷 的 还 巧 呢 ！ ’,"I can guarantee to carry out this mission even more expeditiously than the rest . """
众 耗子 忙 问 ： ‘ 怎么 比 他们 巧 呢 ？ ’,"' "" How will you do that ? "" asked the other mice ."
小 耗子 道 ： ‘ 我 不 学 他们 直 偷 ， 我 只 摇身一变 ， 也 变成 个 香芋 ， 滚 在 香芋 堆 里 ， 叫 人 瞧 不 出来 ， 却 暗暗 儿 的 搬运 ， 渐渐 的 就 搬运 尽 了 ： 这 不 比直 偷 硬取 的 巧 吗 ？ ’,""" I shall not rush at the job head-on like the others , "" said the little mouse . "" By just giving my body a couple of shakes I shall change myself into a sweet potato ; I shall roll myself into the pile of sweet potatoes without anyone seeing me ; then - very , very gently - I shall roll the sweet potatoes away , one by one , until there are not any more left . Is not that a more expeditious way of doing it than the crude and headlong approach which the others have adopted ? """
众 耗子 听 了 ， 都 说 ： ‘ 妙 却 妙 ， 只是 不知 怎么 变 ？ 你 先 变 个 我们 瞧瞧 。 ’,""" That is all very well , "" said the other mice , "" but what about this transformation business ? Let's see you do it first ! """
小 耗子 听 了 ， 笑 道 ： ‘ 这个 不难 ， 等 我 变来 。 ’,""" Nothing easier ! "" said the little mouse with a confident smile . "" Watch ! """
说 毕 ， 摇身 说 ： ‘ 变 。 ’ 竟变 了 一个 最 标致 美貌 的 一位 小姐 。,"' He gave his body a couple of shakes . "" Heypresto ! "" And at once he turned into the most exquisitely beautiful young lady ."
众 耗子 忙 笑 说 ： ‘ 错 了 ， 错 了 ！ 原说 变 果子 ， 怎么 变出 个 小姐 来 了 呢 ？ ’,"' The other mice all laughed . "" No , no , no , you have made a mistake ! That is not a sweet potato , that is a young lady you have turned into ! """
小 耗子 现 了 形笑 道 ： ‘ 我 说 你们 没 见世面 ， 只 认得 这 果子 是 香芋 ， 却 不知 盐 课林 老爷 的 小姐 才 是 真正 的 “ 香玉 ” 呢 。 ’ ”,""" The little mouse resumed his own shape and smiled at them pityingly . ' "" It is you who are mistaken . You have seen too little of the world to understand . The vegetable tuber is not the only kind of sweet potato . The daughter of our respected Salt Commissioner Lin is also a sweet potato . She is the sweetest sweet potato of them all . "" '"
黛玉 听 了 ， 翻身 爬起来 ， 按着 宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 把 你 这个 烂 了 嘴 的 ！ 我 就 知道 你 是 编派 我 呢 。 ”,"Dai-yu got up on her knees and , crawling over , planted herself on top of Bao-yu . ' I will teach you to make fun of me , you hateful creature ! I will teach you ! '"
说 着 便 拧 。,She seized his lips between thumb and finger and began to pinch and shake them .
宝玉 连连 央告 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 饶 了 我 罢 ， 再 不敢 了 ！,' Help ! ' cried Bao-yu . ' Mercy ! I will not do it again !
我 因为 闻见 你 的 香气 ， 忽然 想起 这个 故典 来 。 ”,It was smelling your beautiful perfume that put me in mind of the allusion . '
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 饶 骂 了 人 ， 你 还 说 是 故典 呢 ！ ”,' Allusion ? ' said Dai-yu . ' You vilify someone else and then call it an allusion ? '
一 语 未了 ， 只见 宝钗 走来 ， 笑 问 ： “ 谁 说 故典 呢 ？ 我 也 听听 。 ”,Just at that moment Bao-chai walked in . ' Who is this talking about allusions ? I must hear this ! '
黛玉忙 让 坐 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你 瞧瞧 ， 还有 谁 ？,Dai-yu invited her to sit down . ' Look ! Who else would you expect it to be ?
他 饶 骂 了 ， 还 说 是 故典 。 ”,He says a lot of horrid things about me and then tells me it is an allusion ! '
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 哦 ！ 是 宝兄弟 哟 ！,"' Oh , ' said Bao-chai . ' Cousin Bao ."
怪不得 他 。,"I am not surprised , then ."
他 肚子 里 的 故典 本来 多么 ！,He is full of allusions .
— — 就 只是 可惜 一件 ， 该 用 故典 的 时候 儿 他 就 偏 忘 了 。,The only trouble is that he tends to forget them at the very moment when they are most needed .
有 今儿 记得 的 ， 前儿 夜里 的 芭蕉 诗 就 该 记得 呀 ！,"If he can remember allusions today , he ought to have been able to remember that allusion about the plantain the other night ."
眼面前 儿 的 倒 想不起来 。 别人 冷 的 了不得 ， 他 只是 出汗 。,"But no , it just would not come , and though everyone else was dying of cold , he was perspiring !"
这 会子 偏 又 有 了 记性 了 。 ”,Yet now his memory has come back again . Strange ! '
黛玉 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！,' Now praised be ! ' said Dai-yu .
到底 是 我 的 好 姐姐 。,"' I have a nice , kind cousin to stick up for me . '"
— — 你 一般 也 遇见 对子 了 。,"' You have met your match now , ' she said to Bao-yu ."
可知 一还一报 ， 不爽 不错 的 。 ”,' Now you are going to get as good as you give ! Now we shall see you paid in your own coin ! '
刚 说 到 这里 ， 只 听宝玉 房中 一片 声 吵嚷 起来 。,Their conversation was interrupted by a burst of angry shouting from the direction of Bao-yu 's room .
未知 何事 ， 下回分解 。,The occasion of it will be discussed in the following chapter .
第二十回,Chapter 20
王熙凤 正言弹 妒意,Wang Xi-feng castigates a jealous attitude with some forthright speaking
林黛玉 俏 语 谑 娇 音,And Lin Dai-yu makes a not unattractive speech impediment the subject of a jest
话 说 宝玉 在 黛玉 房中 说 “ 耗子 精 ” ， 宝钗 撞来 ， 讽刺 宝玉 元宵 不知 “ 绿蜡 ” 之典 ， 三 人 正在 房中 互相 取笑 。,We have shown how Bao-yu was in Dai-yu 's room telling her the story of the magic mice ; how Bao-chai burst in on them and twitted Bao-yu with his failure to remember the green wax ' allusion on the night of the Lantern Festival ; and how the three of them sat teasing each other with good-humoured banter .
那宝玉 恐 黛玉 饭后 贪眠 ， 一时 存 了 食 ， 或 夜间 走 了 困 ， 身体 不好 ； 幸而 宝钗 走来 ， 大家 谈笑 ， 那黛玉 方 不 欲 睡 ， 自己 才 放 了 心 。,"Bao-yu had been afraid that by sleeping after her meal Dai-yu would give herself indigestion or suffer from insomnia through being insufficiently tired when she went to bed at night , but Bao-chai 's arrival and the lively conversation that followed it banished all Dai-yu 's desire to sleep and enabled him to lay aside his anxiety on her behalf ."
忽 听 他 房中 嚷起来 ， 大家 侧耳 听 了 一 听 ， 黛玉 先 笑 道 ： “ 这 是 你 妈妈 和 袭 人 叫唤 呢 。,"Just then a sudden commotion arose from the direction of Bao-yu 's room , and the three of them stopped talking and turned their heads to listen . Dai-yu was the first to speak : ' That is your Nannie quarrelling with Aroma , ' she said ."
那 袭 人 待 他 也罢 了 ， 你 妈妈 再 要 认真 排 揎 他 ， 可见 老背晦 了 。 ”,"' To think how that poor girl goes out of her way to be nice to the old woman , yet still she manages to find fault with her ! She really must be getting senile . '"
宝玉 忙 欲 赶过去 ， 宝钗 一把 拉 住 道 ： “ 你 别 和 你 妈妈 吵 才 是 呢 ！,"Bao-yu was for rushing over straight away , but Bao-chai restrained him : ' Do not go quarrelling with your Nannie , whatever you do !"
他 是 老糊涂 了 ， 倒 要 让 他 一步 儿 的 是 。 ”,She is only a silly old woman . You have to indulge her a bit . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 知道 了 。 ”,"' Of course , ' said Bao-yu and ran off ."
说 毕 ， 走来 ， 只见 李嬷嬷 拄着 拐杖 ， 在 当地 骂 袭 人 ： “ 忘 了 本 的 小 娼妇 儿 ！,He found Nannie Li leaning on her stick in the middle of the room abusing Aroma : ' Ungrateful little baggage !
我 抬举 起 你 来 ， 这 会子 我 来 了 ， 你 大模 厮 样儿 的 躺 在 炕上 ， 见 了 我 也 不理 一 理儿 。,"After all I have done for you - and now when I come to call on you , you lie back there on the kang like a young madam and haven ' t even the grace to look up and take notice of me !"
,You and your airs and graces !
一心 只 想妆 狐媚 子 哄 宝玉 ， 哄 的 宝玉 不理 我 ， 只 听 你 的话 。,All you ever think about is how to win Bao-yu over to you . Thanks to you he will not listen to me any more . He only does what you say .
你 不过 是 几两 银子 买 了 来 的 小丫头 子 罢 咧 ， 这 屋里 你 就 作起 耗来 了 ！,To think that a cheap bit of goods like you that they only paid a few taels of silver for should come along here and turn the whole place upside down !
好不好 的 ， 拉出去 配 一个 小子 ， 看 你 还 妖精 似的 哄人 不 哄 ！ ”,The best thing they could do with you would be to marry you off to one of the boys and send you packing . Then we would see how you managed to play the siren and lead young gentlemen astray ! '
袭 人 先 只道 李嬷嬷 不过 因 他 躺 着 生气 ， 少不得 分辩 说 ： “ 病 了 ， 才 出汗 ， 蒙 着 头 ， 原 没 看见 你 老人家 。 ”,"Aroma at first thought that Nannie Li 's anger arose solely on account of her failure to get up and welcome her , and had started to excuse herself on that supposition : ' I am ill , Mrs Li. I have just been sweating . I did not see you because I had my head under the clothes . '"
后来 听见 他 说 “ 哄 宝玉 ” ， 又 说 “ 配 小子 ” ， 由不得 又 羞 又 委屈 ， 禁不住 哭 起来 了 。,"But when the old woman proceeded to go on about leading young men astray and marrying her off to a servant and what not , she felt wronged and humiliated , and in spite of her efforts to restrain them , burst into tears of sheer helplessness ."
宝玉 虽 听 了 这些 话 ， 也 不好 怎样 ， 少不得 替 他 分辩 说 ： “ 病 了 ， 吃药 … … ”,"Bao-yu had heard all this , and though too embarrassed to argue , could scarcely refrain from saying a word or two in Aroma 's defence : ' She is ill . She is having to take medicine , ' he said ."
又 说 ： “ 你 不信 ， 只 问 别的 丫头 。 ”,"' If you do not believe me , ask any of the maids . '"
李嬷嬷 听 了 这话 ， 越发 气 起来 了 ， 说道 ： “ 你 只 护 着 那 起 狐狸 ， 那里 还 认得 我 了 呢 ？,This made the old woman even angrier . ' Oh yes ! You stickup for the little hussies ! You do not care about me any more !
叫 我 问 谁 去 ？,"And which of them am I supposed to ask , pray ?"
谁 不 帮 着 你 呢 ？,They will all take your side against me .
谁 不是 袭 人 拿下马来 的 ？,"You are all under Aroma 's thumb , every one of you ."
我 都 知道 那些 事 ！,"I know what goes on here , do not think I do not !"
我 只 和 你 到 老太太 、 太太 跟前 去 讲讲 ： 把 你 奶 了 这么 大 ， 到 如今 吃 不 着 奶 了 ， 把 我 扔 在 一边 儿 ， 逞 着 丫头 们 要 我 的 强 ！ ”,"Well , you can come along with me to see Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship about this . Let them hear how you have cast me off - me that reared you at my own breast - now that you do not need my milk any more , and how you encourage a pack of snotty-nosed little maidservants to amuse themselves at my expense ! '"
一面 说 ， 一面 哭 。,"She was in tears herself by now , and wept as she cursed ."
彼时 黛 玉宝钗 等 也 过来 劝道 ： “ 妈妈 ， 你 老人家 担待 他们 些 就 完 了 。 ”,"By this time Dai-yu and Bao-chai had also arrived on the scene and did their best to calm her : ' Come , Nannie ! Be a bit more forbearing with them ! Try to forget about it ! '"
李嬷嬷 见 他 二人 来 了 ， 便诉 委屈 ， 将 当日 吃 茶 ， 茜 雪 出去 ， 和 昨日 酥酪 等 事 ， 唠唠叨叨 ， 说 个 不了 。,Nannie Li turned towards this new audience and proceeded to pour out her troubles in an interminable gabble in which tea and Snowpink and drinking koumiss mingled incoherently
可巧 凤姐 正在 上房 算了 输赢 账 ， 听见 后面 一片 声 嚷 ， 便 知 是 李嬷嬷 老病 发 了 ， 又值 他 今儿 输了钱 ， 迁怒于人 ， 排擅 宝玉 的 丫头 ， 便 连忙 赶过来 ， 拉 了 李嬷嬷 ， 笑 道 ： “ 妈妈 别生气 。,"Xi-feng happened to be in Grandmother Jia 's room totting up the day 's scores for the final settlement when she heard this hubbub in the rear apartment . She identified it immediately as Nannie Li on the rampage once more , taking out on Bao-yu 's unfortunate maids some of the spleen occasioned by her recent gambling losses . At once she hurried over , seized Nannie Li by the hand , and admonished her with smiling briskness : ' Now , Nannie , we must not lose our tempers !"
大节 下 ， 老太太 刚 喜欢 了 一日 。,This is the New Year holiday and Her Old Ladyship has been enjoying herself all day .
你 是 个 老人家 ， 别人 吵 ， 你 还要 管 他们 才 是 ； 难道 你 倒 不知 规矩 ， 在 这里 嚷起来 ， 叫 老太太 生气 不成 ？,"A person of your years ought to be stopping other people from quarrelling , not upsetting Her Old Ladyship by quarrelling yourself . Surely you know better than that ?"
你 说 谁 不好 ， 我 替 你 打 他 。,"If anyone has been misbehaving , you have only to tell me and I will have them beaten for you ."
我 屋里 烧 的 滚热 的 野鸡 ， 快 跟 了 我 喝酒 去 罢 。 ”,Now I have got a nice hot pheasant stew in my room . You just come along with me and you shall have some of that and a drink to go with it ! '
一面 说 ， 一面 拉 着 走 ， 又 叫 ： “ 丰儿 ， 替 你 李 奶奶 拿 着 拐 棍子 、 擦 眼泪 的 绢子 。 ”,"She proceeded to haul her off the premises , addressing a few words over her shoulder to her maid Felicity as she went : ' Felicity , bring Nannie 's stick for her , there is a good girl ! And for goodness ' sake give her a handkerchief to wipe her eyes with ! '"
那 李嬷嬷 脚不沾地 ， 跟 了 凤姐儿 走 了 ， 一面 还 说 ： “ 我 也 不要 这 老命 了 ， 索性 今儿 没 了 规矩 ， 闹 一场 子 ， 讨 个 没脸 ， 强似 受 那些 娼妇 的 气 ！ ”,"Unable to hold her ground , the old Nannie was borne off in Xi-feng 's wake , muttering plaintively as she went : ' I wish I was dead , I really do ! But I would sooner forget myself and make a scene like I have today and be shamed in front of you all than put up with the insolence of those shameless little baggages !"
后面 宝钗黛 玉见 凤姐儿 这般 ， 都 拍手 笑 道 ： “ 亏 他 这 一阵风 来 ， 把 个 老婆子 撮 了 去 了 。 ”,"Watching this sudden exit , Bao-chai and Dai-yu laughed and clapped their hands : ' How splendid ! Just the sort of wind we needed to blow the old woman away ! '"
宝玉 点头 叹 道 ： “ 这 又 不知 是 那里 的 账 ， 只 拣 软 的 欺负 ！,But Bao-yu shook his head and sighed : ' I wonder what had really upset her . Obviously she only picked on Aroma because she is weak and can not defend herself .
又 不知 是 那个 姑娘 得罪 了 ， 上在 他 账 上 了 — — ”,I wonder which of the girls had offended her to make her so . . . '
一句 未 完 ， 睛 雯 在 旁 说道 ： “ 谁 又 没疯 了 ， 得罪 他 做 什么 ？,He was interrupted by Skybright : ' Why should any of us want to upset her ? Do you think we are mad ?
既 得罪 了 他 ， 就 有 本事 承任 ， 犯不着 带累 别人 ！ ”,"And even if we had offended her , we should be perfectly capable of owning up to it and not letting someone else take the blame ! '"
袭 人 一面 哭 ， 一面 拉 着 宝玉 道 ： “ 为 我 得罪 了 一个 老奶奶 ， 你 这 会子 又 为 我 得罪 这些 人 ， 这 还 不够 我 受 的 ， 还 只是 拉扯 人 ！ ”,"Aroma grasped Bao-yu 's hand and wept : ' Because I offended one old nurse , you have to go offending a whole roomful of people . Do not you think there is been enough trouble already without dragging other people into it ? '"
宝玉 见 他 这般 病势 ， 又 添 了 这些 烦恼 ， 连忙 忍气吞声 ， 安慰 他 仍旧 睡 下 出汗 。,"Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her condition , Bao-yu stifled his indignation and did his best to comfort her so that she might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever ."
又 见 他 汤烧火热 ， 自己 守 着 他 ， 歪 在 旁边 劝 他 ： “ 只 养病 ， 别 想 那些 没 要紧 的 事 。 ”,"Her skin was burning to the touch . He decided to stay with her for a while , and lying down beside her , spoke to her soothingly : ' Just try to get better , now ! Never mind all that other nonsense ! It is of no importance . '"
袭 人 冷笑 道 ： “ 要 为 这些 事 生气 ， 这 屋里 一刻 还 住 得 了 ？,"Aroma smiled bitterly . ' If I had allowed myself to get upset about things like that , I should not have lasted in this room for five minutes !"
但 只是 天长日久 ， 尽着 这么 闹 ， 可 叫 人 怎么 过 呢 ！,"Still , if we are always going to have this sort of trouble , I think in the long run I just shall not be able to stand any more ."
你 只顾 一时 为 我 得罪 了 人 ， 他们 都 记 在 心里 ， 遇 着 坎儿 ， 说 的 好 说 不好 听 的 ， 大家 什么 意思 呢 ？ ”,"You do not seem to realize . You offend people on my account and the next moment you have forgotten all about it . But they haven ' t . It is all scored up against me ; and as soon as something goes a bit wrong , they come out with all these horrible things about me . It makes it so unpleasant for all of us . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 禁不住 流泪 ， — — 又 怕 宝玉 烦恼 ， 只得 又 勉强 忍 着 。,"She cried weakly as she said this , but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting Bao-yu ."
一时 杂使 的 老婆子 端 了 二 和 药 来 。,Soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of Aroma 's medicine .
宝玉 见 他 才 有点 汗儿 ， 便 不 叫 他 起来 ， 自己 端 着 给 他 就 枕上 吃 了 ， 即令 小 丫鬟 们 铺 炕 。,"Bao-yu could see that she had started sweating again and told her not to get up , holding the medicine for her himself and supporting her while she drank it . Then he told one of the junior maids to make up a bed for her on the kang ."
袭 人 道 ： “ 你 吃饭 不 吃饭 ， 到底 老太太 、 太太 跟前 坐 一会 子 ， 和 姑娘 们 玩 一会 子 ， 再 回来 。,"' Whether you are going to eat there or not , ' Aroma said to him , ' you would better go and sit with Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship for a bit and play a while with the young ladies before you come back here again ."
我 就 静静的 躺 一 躺 也好 啊 。 ”,I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my own . '
宝玉 听说 ， 只得 依 他 ， 看着 他 去 了 簪环 躺 下 ， 才 去 上 屋里 跟着 贾母 吃饭 。,"Bao-yu thought he had better do as she said , and after waiting until she had taken off her ornaments and was lying tucked up in bed , he went to the front apartment and took his dinner with Grandmother Jia ."
饭 毕 ， 贾母 犹欲 和 那 几个 老管家 的 嬷嬷 斗牌 。,After dinner Grandmother Jia wanted to go on playing cards with some of the old stewardesses .
宝玉 惦记 袭 人 ， 便 回至 房中 ， 见 袭 人 朦胧 睡 去 。,"Bao-yu , still worrying about Aroma , returned to his own room , where he found her sleeping fitfully ."
自己 要 睡 ， 天气 尚早 。,"He thought of going to bed himself , but it was still too early ."
彼时 晴雯 、 绮霞 、 秋纹 、 碧痕 都 寻 热闹 找 鸳鸯 琥珀 等 耍 戏 去 了 。,"Skybright , Mackerel , Ripple and Emerald had gone off in quest of livelier entertainment , hoping to persuade Grandmother Jia 's maids , Faithful and Amber , to join them in a game ."
见 麝月 一 人 在 外间 屋里 灯 下 抹 骨牌 。,"Only Musk was left in the outer room , playing Patience under the lamp with a set of dominoes ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 怎么 不 和 他们 去 ？ ”,Bao-yu smiled at her . ' Why do not you go off to join the others ? '
麝月 道 ： “ 没有 钱 。 ”,' I haven ' t got any money . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 床 底下 堆 着 钱 ， 还 不够 你 输 的 ？ ”,' There is a great pile of money under the bed . Is not that enough for you to lose ? '
麝月 道 ： “ 都乐 去 了 ， 这 屋子 交给 谁 呢 ？,"' If we all went off to play , ' said Musk , ' who would look after this room ?"
那 一个 又 病 了 ， 满 屋里 上头 是 灯 ， 下头 是 火 ； 那些 老婆子 们 都 ‘ 老天拔地 ’ ， 伏侍 了 一天 ， 也 该 叫 他们 歇歇 儿 了 ； 小丫头 们 也 伏侍 了 一天 ， 这 会子 还 不 叫 玩玩儿 去 吗 ？,"There is her sick inside . And lamps and stoves burning everywhere . The old women were practically dead on their feet after waiting on you all day ; I had to let them go and rest . And the girls have been on duty all day , too . You could scarcely grudge them some time off now for amusement ."
— — 所以 我 在 这里 看着 。 ”,- Which leaves only me to look after the place . '
宝玉 听 了 这话 ， 公然 又 是 一个 袭 人 了 。,"' Another Aroma , ' thought Bao-yu to himself and gave her another smile ."
因 笑 道 ： “ 我 在 这里 坐 着 ， 你 放心 去 罢 。 ”,' I will sit here while you are away . There is nothing to worry about here if you would like to go . '
麝月 道 ： “ 你 既 在 这里 ， 越发 不用 去 了 。,"' There is even less excuse for going if you are here , ' said Musk ."
咱们 两个 说话 儿 不好 ？ ”,Why can not we both sit here and talk ? '
宝玉 道 ： “ 咱们 两个 做 什么 呢 ？ 怪 没意思 的 … …,' What can we do ? ' said Bao-yu . ' Just sitting here talking is going to be rather dull .
也罢 了 ， 早起 你 说 头上 痒痒 ， 这 会子 没什么 事 ， 我 替 你 篦头 罢 。 ”,"I know ! You were saying this morning that your head was itchy . As you haven ' t got anything else to do now , I will comb it for you . '"
麝月 听 了 道 ： “ 使得 。 ” 说 着 ， 将 文具 镜匣 搬 来 ， 卸去 钗 镮 ， 打开 头发 ， 宝玉 拿 了 篦子 替 他 篦 。,"' All right , ' said Musk , and fetching her toilet-box with the mirror on top she proceeded to take off her ornaments and shake her hair out . Bao-yu took a comb and began to comb it for her ."
只篦 了 三五下 儿 ， 见 晴雯 忙忙 走进 来 取钱 ， 一 见 他 两个 ， 便 冷笑 道 ： “ 哦 ！ 交杯 盏 儿 还 没 吃 ， 就上 了头 了 ！ ”,"But he had not drawn it more than four or five times through her hair , when Skybright came bursting in to get some more money . Seeing the two of them together , she smiled sarcastically : ' Fancy ! Doing her hair already - before you have even drunk the marriage-cup ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 来 ， 我 也 替 你 篦篦 。 ”,"Bao-yu laughed . ' Come here ! I will do yours for you too , if you like ! '"
晴雯 道 ： “ 我 没 这么 大 造化 ！ ”,"' I would not presume , thanks all the same ! '"
说 着 ， 拿 了 钱 ， 摔 了 帘子 ， 就 出去 了 。,"She took the money , and with a swish of the door-blind was gone ."
宝玉 在 麝月 身后 ， 麝月 对 镜 ， 二人 在 镜内 相视而笑 。,Bao-yu was standing behind Musk as she sat looking at herself in the mirror . Their eyes met in the glass and they both laughed .
宝玉 笑 着 道 ： “ 满 屋里 就 只是 他 磨牙 。 ”,"Of all the girls in this room she has the sharpest tongue , said Bao-yu ."
麝月 听说 ， 忙 向 镜 中 摆手 儿 ， 宝玉 会意 ， 忽 听 “ 嗯 ” 一声 帘子 响 ， 晴雯 又 跑 进来 问道 ： “ 我 怎么 磨牙 了 ？ 咱们 倒 得 说 说 ！ ”,"Musk signalled to him agitatedly in the glass with her hand . Bao-yu took her meaning ; but it was too late . With another swish of the door-blind , Skybright had already darted in again . ' Oh ! Sharp-tongued , am I ? Perhaps you would like to say a bit more on that subject ? '"
麝月 笑 道 ： “ 你 去 你 的 罢 ， 又 来 拌嘴 儿 了 。 ”,' Get along with you ! ' laughed Musk . ' Do not go starting any more arguments ! '
晴雯 也 笑 道 ： “ 你 又 护 着 他 了 ！,' And do not you go sticking up for him ! ' said Skybright gaily .
你们 瞒神弄鬼 的 ， 打量 我 都 不 知道 呢 ！,"' I know what you are up to , you two . You do not deceive me with your goings-on ."
等 我 捞回 本儿 来 再说 。 ”,I will have something to say to you about this when I get back later . Just wait until I have won some of my money back ! '
说 着 ， 一 径 去 了 。,With that she darted off once more .
这里 宝玉 通了 头 ， 命 麝月 悄悄的 伏侍 他 睡 下 ， 不肯 惊动 袭 人 。,"When Bao-yu had finished combing her hair , he asked Musk to help him get to bed - very quietly , so as not to disturb Aroma ."
一 宿 无 话 。,And that ends our account of that day .
次日 清晨 ， 袭 人 已 是 夜间 出 了 汗 ， 觉得 轻松 了 些 ， 只 吃 些 米汤 静养 。,First thing next morning Aroma awoke to find that she had sweated heavily during the night and that her body felt very much lighter ; but she would take only a little congee for breakfast in order not to tax her system too soon .
宝玉 才 放 了 心 。 因 饭后 走 到 薛姨妈 这边 来 闲逛 。,"Bao-yu saw that there was no further cause for concern , and after his meal drifted off to Aunt Xue 's apartment in search of amusement ."
彼时 正月 内 ， 学 房中 放年学 ， 闺阁 中忌 针黹 ， 都 是 闲时 ， 因 贾环 也 过来 玩 。,"Now this was the prime of the year , when the schoolroom is closed for the New Year holiday and the use of the needle is forbidden to maidenly fingers throughout the whole of the Lucky Month , so that boys and girls alike are all agreeably unemployed , and Bao-yu 's half-brother Jia Huan , on holiday like all the rest , had also drifted over to Aunt Xue 's place in search of amusement ."
正 遇见 宝钗 、 香菱 、 莺 儿 三个 赶 围棋 作耍 。 贾环见 了 也 要 玩 。,"He found Bao-chai , Caltrop and Oriole there playing a game of Racing Go , and after watching them for a bit , wanted to play too ."
宝钗素 日 看 他 也 如 宝玉 ， 并 没 他 意 ； 今儿 听 他 要 玩 ， 让 他 上来 ， 坐在 一处 玩 。,"Bao-chai had always behaved towards Jia Huan in exactly the same way as she did towards Bao-yu and made no distinctions between them . Consequently , when he asked to play , she at once made a place for him and invited him to join them on the kang ."
一 注 十个 钱 。,They played for stakes of ten cash each a game .
头一回 ， 自己 赢 了 ， 心中 十分 喜欢 。,Jia Huan won the first game and felt very pleased .
谁知 后来 接连 输 了 几盘 ， 就 有些 着急 。,"But then , as luck would have it , he lost several times in a row and began to get somewhat rattled ."
赶着 这 盘 正该 自己 掷骰子 ， 〈 若 掷 个 七点 便 赢 了 ， 若 掷 个 六点 ， 下该 莺 儿 掷 三点 就 赢 了 。 〉,"It was now his turn to throw the dice . He needed seven to win , and if he threw anything less than seven , the dice would go next to Oriole , who needed only three ."
因 拿起 骰子 来 狠命 一 掷 ， 一个 坐定 了 二 ， 那 一个 乱转 。,He hurled them from the pot with all his might . One of them rested at two . The other continued rather erratically to roll about .
莺 儿 拍 着手 儿 叫 “ 么 ！ ”,"' Ace ! Ace ! Ace ! ' cried Oriole , clapping her hands ."
贾环便 瞪 着眼 ， “ 六 ！ ” “ 七 ！ ” “ 八 ！ ” 混叫 。,' Six ! Seven ! Eight ! ' shouted Jia Huan glaring at Oriole and commanding the die to perform the impossible .
那 骰子 偏生 转出 么 来 。,"But the perverse wanderer finally came to rest with the ace uppermost , making a grand total of three ."
贾环 急 了 ， 伸手 便 抓起 骰子 来 ， 就要 拿 钱 ， 说 是 个 ＜ 六 ＞ 点 。,"With the speed of desperation Jia Huan reached out and snatched it up , claiming , as he did so , that it was a six ."
莺 儿 便 说 ： “ 明明 是 个 么 ！ ”,"' It was an ace , ' said Oriole , ' as plain as anything ! '"
宝钗见 贾环 急 了 ， 便 瞅 了 莺 儿 一眼 ， 说道 ： “ 越 大越 没规矩 ！,"Bao-chai could see that Jia Huan was rattled , and darting a sharp look at Oriole , commanded her to yield ' You grow more unmannerly every day , ' she told her ."
难道 爷们 还 赖 你 ？,' Surely you do not think one of the masters would cheat you ?
还 不 放下 钱 来 呢 。 ”,Come on ! Put your money down ! '
莺 儿 满心 委屈 ， 见 姑娘 说 ， 不敢 出 声 ， 只得 放下 钱 来 ， 口 内 嘟嚷 说 ： “ 一个 做爷 的 ， 还赖 我们 这 几个 钱 ， — — 连 我 也 瞧不起 ！,"Oriole smarted with the injustice of this , but her mistress had ordered it , so she had to pay up without arguing . She could not , however , forbear a few rebellious mutterings : ' Huh ! One of the masters ! Cheating a maid out of a few coppers ! Even I should be ashamed !"
前儿 和 宝二爷 玩 ， 他 输 了 那些 ， 也 没 着急 ， 下剩 的 钱 还是 几个 小丫头 子们 一 抢 ， — — 他 一 笑 就 罢了 。 ”,"Look how much money Bao-yu lost when he was playing with us the other day , yet he did not mind . Even when some of the maids took all he had left , he only laughed . . . '"
宝钗 不等 说完 ， 连忙 喝住 了 。,"She would have gone on , but Bao-chai checked her angrily ."
贾环 道 ： “ 我 拿 什么 比 宝玉 ？ 你们 怕 他 ， 都 和 他 好 ， 都 欺负 我 不是 太太 养 的 ！ ” 说 着 便 哭 。,"' How can I hope to compete with Bao-yu ? ' said Jia Huan , beginning to blubber . You are all afraid of him . You all take his part against me because I am only a concubine 's son . '"
宝钗忙 劝 他 ： “ 好 兄弟 ， 快 别说 这话 ， 人家 笑话 。 ”,"Bao-chai was shocked : ' Please do not say things like that , Cousin ! You will make yourself ridiculous . '"
又 骂 莺 儿 。,Once more she rebuked Oriole .
正值 宝玉 走来 ， 见 了 这般 景况 ， 问 ： “ 是 怎么 了 ？ ”,"Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in , and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in , asked him what was the matter ."
贾环 不敢 则 声 。,But Jia Huan dared not say anything .
宝钗素 知 他家 规矩 ： 凡 做 兄弟 的怕 哥哥 。,"Bao-chai , familiar with the state of affairs , normal in other families , which places the younger brother in fearful subjection to the elder , assumed that Jia Huan was afraid of Bao-yu ."
却 不知 那宝玉 是 不要 人 怕 他 的 。,She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of him .
他 想着 ： “ 兄弟 们 一并 都 有 父母 教训 ， 何必 我 多 事 ， 反 生疏 了 。 况且 我 是 正出 ， 他 是 庶出 ， 饶 这样 看待 ， 还有 人 背后 谈论 ， 还 禁得 辖治 了 他 ？ ”,"' We are both equally subject to our parents ' control , ' he would say of himself and Jia Huan . ' Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself - especially when I am the wife 's son and he is the concubine 's ? People already talk behind our backs , even when I do nothing . It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about . '"
更 有 个 呆 意思 存在 心里 。,"But there was another , zanier , notion which contributed to this attitude ."
你 道 是 何 呆 意 ？,Let us try to explain it .
因 他 自幼 姐妹 丛中 长大 ， 亲姊妹 有 元春 探春 ， 叔伯 的 有 迎春 惜春 ， 亲戚 中 又 有 湘云 、 黛玉 、 宝钗 等 人 ， 他 便 料定 天地间 灵淑 之 气 ， 只 钟 于 女子 ， 男儿 们 不过 是 些 渣滓 浊沫 而已 。,"Bao-yu had from early youth grown up among girls . There were his sisters Yuan-chun and Tan-chun , his cousins of the same surname Ying-chun and Xi-chun , and his distaff-cousins Shi Xiang-yun , Lin Dai-yu and Xue Bao-chai . As a result of this upbringing , he had come to the conclusion that the pure essence of humanity was all concentrated in the female of the species and that males were its mere dregs and off-scourings ."
因此 把 一切 男子 都 看成 浊物 ， 可有可无 。,"To him , therefore , all members of his own sex without distinction were brutes who might just as well not have existed ."
只是 父亲 、 伯叔 、 兄弟 之伦 ， 因是 圣人 遗训 ， 不敢 违忤 ， 所以 兄弟 间 亦 不过 尽 其 大概 就 罢了 ， 并 不想 ， 自己 是 男子 ， 须要 为 子弟 之 表率 。,"Only in the case of his father , uncles and brother , where rudeness and disobedience were expressly forbidden by the teachings of Confucius , did he make an exception - and even then the allowances he made in respect of the fraternal bond were extremely perfunctory . It certainly never occurred to him that his own maleness placed him under any obligation to set an example to the younger males in his clan ."
是 以 贾环 等 都 不 甚怕 他 ， 只因怕 贾母 不依 ， 才 只得 让 他 三分 。,The latter - Jia Huan included - reciprocated with a healthy disrespect only slightly tempered by their fear of his doting grandmother
现今 宝钗 生怕 宝玉 教训 他 ， 倒 没意思 ， 便 连忙 替 贾环 掩饰 。,"But Bao-chai was ignorant of all this ; and fearing that Bao-yu might embarrass them all by delivering a big brother 's telling-off , she hastened to Jia Huan 's defence ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 大 正月 里 ， 哭 什么 ？,"' What are you crying about in the middle of the New Year holidays ? ' said Bao-yu to Jia Huan , ignoring Bao-chai 's excuses ."
这里 不好 ， 到 别处 玩 去 。,"If you do not like it here , why do not you go somewhere else ?"
你 天天 念书 ， 倒念 糊涂 了 。,I think your brains must have been addled by too much study .
譬如 这件 东西 不好 ， 横竖 那 一件 好 ， 就 舍 了 这件 取 那件 。,"Can not you see that if there is something you do not like , there must be something else you do like , and that all you have got to do is leave the one and go after the other ?"
难道 你 守 着 这件 东西 哭 会子 就 好 了 不成 ？,Not hang on to it and cry . Crying will not make it any better .
你 原是 要 取乐 儿 ， 倒 招 的 自己 烦恼 ， 还 不快 去 呢 ！ ”,"You came here to enjoy yourself , did not you ? And now you are here you are miserable , right ? Then the thing to do is to go somewhere else , is not it ? '"
贾环 听 了 ， 只得 回来 。,In the face of such an argument Jia Huan could not very well remain .
赵姨娘 见 他 这般 ， 因 问 ： “ 是 那里 垫 了 踹 窝 来 了 ？ ” 〈 一 问 不答 ， 再 问 时 ， 〉 贾环便 说 ： “ 同 宝姐姐 玩 来 着 。 莺 儿 欺负 我 ， 赖 我 的 钱 ； 宝玉 哥哥 撵 了 我 来 了 。 ”,"When he got back to his own apartment , his real mother , Aunt Zhao ( Lady Wang was his mother only in name ) observed the dejected state he was in . ' Who is been making a doormat of you this time ? ' she asked him , and , obtaining no immediate reply , asked again . ' I have just been playing at Bao-chai 's . Oriole cheated me and Bao-yu turned me out . '"
赵姨娘 啐 道 ： “ 谁 叫 你 上 高台 盘 了 ？ 下流 没脸 的 东西 ！ 那里 玩 不得 ？ 谁 叫 你 跑 了 去 讨 这 没意思 ？ ”,Aunt Zhao spat contemptuously : ' Nasty little brat ! That is what comes of getting above yourself . Who asked you to go playing with that lot ? You could have gone anywhere else to play . Asking for trouble ! '
正说 着 。 可巧 凤姐 在 窗外 过 ， 都 听到 耳内 ， 便 隔 着 窗户 说道 ： “ 大 正月 里 ， 怎么 了 ？,"Just at that moment Xi-feng happened to be passing by outside , and hearing what she said , shouted back at her through the window : ' What sort of language is that to be using in the middle of the New Year holiday ?"
兄弟 们 小孩子 家 ， 一 半点儿 错 了 ， 你 只 教导 他 ， 说 这样 话 做 什么 ？,He is only a child . He hasn ' t done anything terrible . What do you want to go carrying on at him like that for ?
凭 他 怎么着 ， 还有 老爷 太太 管 他 呢 ， 就 大 口家 啐 他 ？,"No matter where he is been , Sir Zheng and Lady Wang are quite capable of looking after him themselves . There is no cause for you to go biting his head off !"
他 现 是 主子 ， 不好 ， 横竖 有 教导 他 的 人 ， 与 你 什么 相干 ？,"After all , he is one of the masters . If he is misbehaved himself , you should leave the telling-off to those whose job it is . It is no business of yours ."
— — 环 兄弟 ， 出来 ！,Huan ! Come out here !
跟 我 玩 去 。 ”,Come and play with me ! '
贾环 素日 怕 凤姐 ， 比怕 王夫人 更 甚 ， 听见 叫 他 ， 便 赶忙 出来 。,"Jia Huan had always been afraid of Xi-feng - more even than he was of Lady Wang - and hearing her call him , came running out immediately ."
赵姨娘 也 不敢 出 声 。,Aunt Zhao dared not say a word .
凤姐 向 贾环 道 ： “ 你 也 是 个 没 性气 的 东西 呦 ！,' You are a poor-spirited creature ! ' Xi-feng said to him .
时常 说 给 你 ： 要 吃 ， 要 喝 ， 要 玩 ， 你 爱 和 那个 姐姐 妹妹 哥哥 嫂子 玩 ， 就 和 那个 玩 。,How many times have I told you that you can eat and drink and play with any of the boys and girls you like ?
你 总 不 听 我 的话 ， 倒 叫 这些 人教 的 你 歪心邪意 、 狐媚魇道 的 。,"But instead of doing as I say , you hang about with these other people and let them warp your mind for you and fill it up with mischief ."
自己 又 不 尊重 ， 要 往下流 里 走 ， 安 着 坏心 ， 还 只 怨 人家 偏心 呢 。,"You have no self-respect , that is your trouble . Can not keep away from the gutter . You insist on making yourself disagreeable and then you complain that people are prejudiced against you !"
输 了 几个 钱 ， 就 这么 个 样儿 ！ ”,Fancy making a fuss like that about losing a few coppers !
因 问 贾环 ： “ 你 输 了 多少钱 ？ ”,How much did you lose ? '
贾环见 问 ， 只得 诺诺 的 说道 ： “ 输 了 一二百 钱 。 ”,"' One or two hundred , ' Jia Huan muttered abjectly ."
凤姐 啐 道 ： “ 亏了 你 还是 个爷 ， 输 了 一二百 钱 就 这么着 ！ ”,' All this fuss about one or two hundred cash ! And you one of the masters ! ' She turned to Felicity .
回头 叫 ： “ 丰儿 ， 去取 一 吊 钱 来 ； 姑娘 们 都 在 后头 玩 呢 ， 把 他 送 了 去 。,"' Go and get a string of cash for him , Felicity , and take him round to the back where Miss Ying and the girls are playing !"
— — 你 明儿 再 这么 狐媚 子 ， 我 先 打 了 你 ， 再 叫 人 告诉 学里 ， 皮 不 揭 了 你 的 ！,"And if I have any more of this nonsense from you in future , young man , ' she went on to Jia Huan , ' I will first give you a good hiding myself and then send someone to tell the school about you and see if they can knock a bit of sense into you !"
为 你 这 不 尊贵 ， 你 哥哥 恨 得 牙痒痒 ， 不是 我 拦 着 ， 窝心 脚 把 你 的 肠子 还 窝 出来 呢 ！ ”,"It sets your Cousin Lian 's teeth on edge to see you so wanting in self-respect . He would have disembowelled you by now I should not wonder , if I had not kept his hands off you !"
喝令 ： “ 去 罢 ！ ”,Now be off with you ! '
贾环 诺诺 的 ， 跟 了 丰儿 ， 得 了 钱 ， 自去 和 迎春 等 玩 去 ， 不在话下 。,"' Yes , ' said Jia Huan meekly and went off with Felicity . When he had got his money , he took himself off to play with Ying-chun and the girls . And there we must leave him ."
且说 宝玉 正 和 宝钗 玩笑 ， 忽 见 人 说 ： “ 史 大姑娘 来 了 。 ”,"While Bao-yu was enjoying himself with Bao-chai , a servant announced that Miss Shi had arrived , and he hurriedly got up to go ."
宝玉 听 了 ， 连忙 就 走 ， 宝钗笑 道 ： “ 等 着 ， 咱们 两个 一齐 儿 走 ， 瞧瞧 他 去 。 ”,' Wait ! ' said Bao-chai . ' Let's go and see her together ! '
说 着 ， 下 了 炕 ， 和 宝玉 来 至 贾母 这边 。,"She got down from the kang as she said this , and accompanied him round to Grandmother Jia 's apartment ."
只见 史湘云 大 说 大笑 的 ， 见 了 他 两个 ， 忙 站 起来 问好 。,"Shi Xiang-yun was already there , laughing and chattering away nineteen to the dozen , but rose to greet them as they entered ."
正值 黛玉 在 旁 ， 因 问宝玉 ： “ 打 那里 来 ？ ”,Dai-yu was there too . ' Where have you been ? ' she asked Bao-yu .
宝玉 便 说 ： “ 打 宝姐姐 那里 来 。 ”,' Bao-chai 's . '
黛玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 说 呢 ！,' I see ' ( very frostily ) .
亏了 绊 往 ， 不然 ， 早就 飞 了 来 了 。 ”,I thought something must have been detaining you . Otherwise you would have come flying here long since . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 只许 和 你 玩 ， 替 你 解闷 儿 ； 不过 偶然 到 他 那里 ， 就 说 这些 闲话 。 ”,"' Is one only allowed to play with you , ' said Bao-yu , ' and keep you amused ? I just happened to be visiting her . Why should you start making remarks like that ? '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 好 没意思 的话 ！,' How thoroughly disagreeable you are ! ' said Dai-yu .
去不去 ， 管 我 什么 事 ？,' What do I care whether you go to see her or not ?
又 没 叫 你 替 我 解闷 儿 ！,And I am sure I never asked to be kept amused .
— — 还许 你 从此 不理 我 呢 ！ ”,"From now on you can ignore me completely , as far as I am concerned . '"
说 着 ， 便 赌气 回房 去 了 。,With that she went back to her own room in a temper .
宝玉 忙 跟 了 来 ， 问道 ： “ 好好儿 的 又 生气 了 ； 就是 我 说错 了 ， 你 到底 也 还 坐坐 儿 ， 合 别人 说 笑 一会 子 啊 。 ”,"Bao-yu came running after . ' What on earth are you upset about this time ? Even if I have said anything wrong , you ought , out of simple courtesy , to sit and talk with the others for a bit ! '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 管 我 呢 ！ ”,' Are you telling me how to behave ? '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 自然 不敢 管 你 ， 只是 你 自己 遭塌 坏 了 身子 呢 。 ”,' Of course not . It is just that you destroy your health by carrying on in this way . '
黛玉 道 ： “ 我 作践 了 我 的 身子 ， 我 死 我 的 ， 与你何干 ？ ”,"' That is my affair . If I choose to die , I do not see that it is any concern of yours ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 何苦 来 ？ 大 正月 里 ， ‘ 死 ’ 了 ‘ 活 ’ 了 的 。 ”,"' Oh , really , really ! Here we are in the middle of the New Year holiday , and you have to start talking about death ! '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 偏 说 ‘ 死 ’ ！ 我 这 会子 就 死 ！ 你 怕死 ， 你 长命百岁 的 活着 ！ 好不好 ？ ”,"' I do not care . I will talk about death if I like . Death ! Death ! Death ! I am going to die this minute . If you are so afraid of death , I wish you long life . A hundred years , will that satisfy you ?"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 要象 只管 这么 闹 ， 我 还 怕死 吗 ？ 倒不如 死 了 干净 。 ”,' Do you think I am afraid of dying when all you will do is quarrel ? I wish I were dead . It would be a relief . '
黛玉 忙 道 ： “ 正是 了 ， 要是 这样 闹 ， 不如 死 了 干净 ！ ”,"' Exactly ! ' said Dai-yu . ' If I were to die , it would be a relief from all this quarrelling ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 说 自家 死 了 干净 ， 别 错 听 了 话 ， 又 赖 人 。 ”,"' I said if I were to die , said Bao-yu . ' Don ' t twist my words . It is not fair . '"
正说 着 ， 宝钗 走来 ， 说 ： “ 史大妹妹 等 你 呢 。 ”,Just then Bao-chai came hurrying in . ' Cousin Shi 's waiting for you ! '
说 着 ， 便 拉 宝玉 走 了 。 这 黛玉 越发 气闷 ， 只 向 窗前 流泪 。,"She took hold of Bao-yu 's hand and pulled him after her , to the great mortification of Dai-yu , who sat with her face to the window and shed tears of pure rage ."
没 两盏 茶 时 ， 宝玉 仍 来 了 。,"After about as long as it would take to drink two cups of tea , Bao-yu came back again ."
黛玉 见 了 ， 越发 抽抽搭搭 的 哭 个 不住 。,During his absence Dai-yu 's sobs seemed to have redoubled in intensity .
宝玉 见 了 这样 ， 知难 挽回 ， 打叠 起 百样 的 款语温言 来 劝慰 。,Seeing the state she was in he realized that it would need careful handling and began turning over in his mind all kinds of soft and soothing things to coax her with .
不料 自己 没 张口 ， 只 听 黛玉先 说道 ： “ 你 又 来 作 什么 ？,"But before he could get his mouth open , she had anticipated him : ' What have you come for this time ?"
死活 凭 我 去 罢了 ！,Why can not you just leave me here to die in peace ?
横竖 如今 有人 和 你 玩 ： 比 我 又 会 念 ， 又 会 作 ， 又 会 写 ， 又 会 说 会 笑 ， — — 又 怕 你 生气 ， 拉 了 你 去 哄 着 你 。,"After all , you have got a new playmate now - one who can read and write and compose and laugh and talk to you much better than I can . Oh yes , and drag you off to be amused if there is any danger of your getting upset !"
你 又 来 作 什么 呢 ？ ”,I really can not imagine what you have come back here for ! '
宝玉 听 了 ， 忙 上前 悄悄的 说道 ： “ 你 这么 个 明白人 ， 难道 连 ‘ 亲不 隔 疏 ， 后 不 僭 先 ’ 也 不 知道 ？,"' "" Old friends are best friends and close kin are kindest , "" ' said Bao-yu , coming over to where she sat and speaking very quietly . ' You ' re too intelligent not to know that ."
我 虽 糊涂 ， 却 明白 这 两句话 。,Even a simpleton like me knows that much !
头 一件 ， 咱们 是 姑舅姐妹 ， 宝姐姐 是 两 姨 姐妹 ， 论 亲戚 也 比 你 远 。,Take kinship first : you are my cousin on Father 's side ; Cousin Bao is only a mother-cousin . That makes you much the closer kin .
第二件 ， 你 先 来 ， 咱们 两个 一桌 吃 ， 一床 睡 ， 从小儿 一处 长大 的 ， 他 是 才 来 的 ， 岂 有 个 为 他 远 你 的 呢 ？ ”,"And as for length of acquaintance : it was you who came here first . You and I have practically grown up together - eaten at the same table , even slept in the same bed . Compared with you she is practically a new arrival . Why should I ever be any less close to you because of her ? '"
黛 玉碎 道 ： “ 我 难道 叫 你 远 他 ？,' Whatever do you take me for ?
我 成 了 什么 人 了 呢 ？,Do you think I want you to be any less close to her because of me ?
— — 我 为的是 我 的 心 ！ ”,It is the way I feel that makes me the way I am . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 也 为的是 我 的 心 。,"' And it is the way I feel , ' said Bao-yu , that makes me the way I am !"
你 难道 就 知道 你 的 心 ， 不 知道 我 的 心 不成 ？ ”,Do you mean to tell me that you know your own feelings about me but still do not know what my feelings are about you ? '
黛玉 听 了 ， 低头不语 ， 半日 说道 ： “ 你 只 怨 人 行动 嗔怪 你 ， 你 再 不 知道 你 怄 的 人 难受 。,Dai-yu lowered her head and made no reply . After a pause she said : ' You complain that whatever you do people are always getting angry with you . You do not seem to realize how much you provoke them by what you do .
就 拿 今日 天气 比 ， 分明 冷 些 ， 怎么 你 倒脱 了 青 肷 披风 呢 ？ ”,"Take today , for instance . It is obviously colder today than it was yesterday . Then why of all days should you choose today to leave your blue cape off ? '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 何尝 没 穿 ？ 见 你 一恼 ， 我 一 暴燥 ， 就 脱 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu laughed . ' I did not . I was wearing it this morning the same as usual ; but when you started quarrelling just now , I got into such a sweat that I had to take it off . '"
黛玉叹 道 ： “ 回来 伤 了 风 ， 又 该 讹 着 吵 吃 的 了 。 ”,"' Next thing you will be catching a cold , ' said Dai-yu with a sigh , ' and then Heaven knows what grumblings and scoldings there will be ! !"
二人 正说 着 ， 只见 湘云 走来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 爱 哥哥 ， 林姐姐 ， 你们 天天 一处 玩 ， 我 好容易 来 了 ， 也 不理 我 理儿 。 ”,"Just then Xiang-yun burst in on them and reproved them smilingly for abandoning her : ' Couthin Bao , Couthin Lin : you can thee each other every day . It ' th not often I get a chanthe to come here ; yet now I have come , you both ignore me ! '"
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 偏 是 咬舌 子爱 说话 ， 连 个 ‘ 二 ’ 哥哥 也 叫 不 上来 ， 只是 ‘ 爱 ’ 哥哥 ‘ 爱 ’ 哥哥 的 。,"Dai-yu burst out laughing : ' Lisping does not seem to make you any less talkative ! Listen to you : "" Couthin ! "" "" Couthin ! """
回来 赶 围棋 儿 ， 又 该 你 闹 么 ‘ 爱 ’ 三 了 。 ”,"Presently , when you are playing Racing Go , you will be all "" thicktheth "" and "" theventh "" ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 学 惯 了 ， 明儿 连 你 还 咬起来 呢 。 ”,"' You would better not imitate her , ' said Bao-yu . ' It will get to be a habit . You will be lisping yourself before you know where you are . '"
湘云 道 ： “ 他 再 不 放 人 一点儿 ， 专会 挑 人 。,' How you do pick on one ! ' said Xiang-yun . ' Always finding fault .
就算 你 比 世人 好 ， 也 不犯 见 一个 打趣 一个 。,"Even if you are tho perfect yourthelf , I do not thee why you have to go making fun of everyone elthe ."
我 指出 个人 来 ， 你 敢 挑 他 ， 我 就 服 你 。 ”,But I can show you thomeone you will not dare to find fault with . I shall certainly think you a wonder if you do . '
黛玉 便 问 ： “ 是 谁 ？ ”,' Who is that ? ' said Dai-yu .
湘云 道 ： “ 你 敢 挑 宝姐姐 的 短处 ， 就算 你 是 个 好 的 。 ”,"' If you can find any shortcomings in Cousin Bao-chai , said Xiang-yun , you must be very good indeed ."
黛玉 听 了 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 当 是 谁 ， 原来 是 他 ！,"' Oh her , ' said Dai-yu coldly . ' I wondered whom you could mean ."
我 可 那里 敢 挑 他 呢 ？ ”,I should never dare to find fault with her . '
宝玉 不等 说完 ， 忙 用 话 分开 。,"But before she could say any more , Bao-yu cut in and hurriedly changed the subject ."
湘云 笑 道 ： “ 这 一辈子 我 自然 比不上 你 。,"' I shall never be a match for you as long as I live , ' Xiang-yun said to Dai-yu with a disarming smile ."
我 只 保佑 着 明儿 得 一个 咬舌儿 林 姐夫 ， 时时刻刻 你 可 听 ‘ 爱 ’ ‘ 呀 ’ ‘ 厄 ’ 的 去 ！,"' All I can thay ith that I hope you marry a lithping huthband , tho that you have "" ithee-withee "" "" ithee-withee "" in your earth every minute of the day ."
阿弥陀佛 ， 那时 才 现在 我 眼里 呢 ！ ”,"Ah , Holy Name ! I think I can thee that blethed day already before my eyeth ! '"
说 的 宝玉 一 笑 ， 湘云 忙 回身 跑 了 。,Bao-yu could not help laughing ; but Xiang-yun had already turned and fled .
要知 端详 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"If you wish to know the conclusion of this scene , you must read the following chapter ."
第二十一回,Chapter 21
贤 袭 人 娇嗔 箴 宝玉,Righteous Aroma discovers how to rebuke her master by saying nothing
俏 平儿 软语 救 贾琏,And artful Patience is able to rescue hers by being somewhat less than truthful
话 说 史湘云 说 着 笑 着 跑 出来 ， 怕 黛玉 赶上 。,"As Shi Xiang-yun , fearful that Dai-yu would pursue her , turned and fled , Bao-yu shouted after her :"
宝玉 在 后 忙 说 ： “ 绊倒 了 ！,' Mind you do not trip !
那里 就 赶上 了 ？ ”,"She is not going to catch up with you , anyway . '"
黛玉 赶到 门前 ， 被 宝玉 叉手 在 门框 上 拦住 ， 笑 道 ： “ 饶 他 这 一遭 儿 罢 。 ”,"And when Dai-yu reached the doorway where he was standing , he spread his arms across it to stop her getting by and laughingly begged an amnesty for Xiang-yun ."
黛玉拉 着手 说道 ： “ 我 要 饶 了 云儿 ， 再 不 活着 。 ”,"' Never ! ' said Dai-yu , endeavouring to tug one of his hands away from the door-jamb . ' I will get that Yun if it is the last thing I do ! '"
湘云 见 宝玉 拦 着 门 ， 料 黛玉 不能 出来 ， 便 立住 脚 ， 笑 道 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 饶 我 这 遭 儿 罢 ！ ”,"With Bao-yu blocking the doorway and Dai-yu evidently unable to get past him ,"
却值 宝钗 来 在 湘云 身 背后 ， 也 笑 道 ： “ 我 劝 你们 两个 看 宝兄弟 面上 ， 都 撂 开手 罢 。 ”,"Xiang-yun deemed it safe to stop running , and turned to plead with her pursuer : ' Plea the cousin , just this once - spare me ! '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 我 不依 。,"Just then Bao-chai appeared from behind her shoulder - the smiling peacemaker : ' I advise you two to make it up , for Cousin Bao 's sake . '"
你们 是 一气 的 ， 都 来 戏弄 我 。 ”,' I will not ! ' said Dai-yu . ' You are all in league against me . You have all come here to make fun of me . '
宝玉 劝道 ： “ 罢 哟 ， 谁 敢 戏弄 你 ？,"' Oh , really ! ' said Bao-yu . ' Who would ever have the nerve to make fun of you ?"
你 不 打趣 他 ， 他 就敢 说 你 了 ？ ”,Yun only said what she said because you mimicked her in the first place . She would never have dared to otherwise . '
四 人 正 难 分解 ， 有人 来 请 吃饭 ， 方 往前 边 来 。,It is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in Grandmother Jia 's room .
那天 已 掌灯 时分 ， 王夫人 、 李 纨 、 凤姐 、 迎 探惜 姊妹 等 ， 都 往 贾母 这边 来 。,"It was already lighting-up time and Lady Wang , Li Wan , Xi-feng , Ying-chun , Tan-chun and Xi-chun had also forgathered for the meal ."
大家 闲话 了 一回 ， 各自 归寝 。 湘云 仍往 黛玉 房中 安歇 。,"When dinner was over , the company conversed for a while and then retired to their various rooms for the night - Xiang-yun to sleep with Dai-yu in what had once , in the days when she lived with Grandmother Jia , been her own bedroom ."
宝玉 送 他 二人 到 房 ， 那天 已 二 更 多 了 ， 袭 人 来 催 了 几次 方 回 。,"Bao-yu saw the two of them back to their room and stayed there talking until well after ten , in spite of frequent summonses by Aroma ."
次早 ， 天方 明 时 ， 便 披衣 靸 鞋 往 黛 玉 房中 来 了 ， 却 不见 紫鹃 翠缕 二人 ， 只有 他 姊妹 两个 尚 卧 在 衾 内 。,"As soon as it was light next morning , Bao-yu was off again to the girls ' room , shuffling along in his slippers and with a gown thrown loosely round his shoulders . The maids Nightingale and Kingfisher were not yet about , and their two young mistresses still lay fast asleep under the covers ."
那黛玉 严严密密 裹 着 一幅 杏子 红 绫被 ， 安稳 合目 而 睡 。,"Dai-yu was tightly cocooned in a quilt of apricot-coloured damask , the picture of tranquil repose ."
湘云 却 一把 青丝 ， 拖于 枕畔 ， 一幅 桃红 䌷 被 ， 只 齐胸 盖 着 ， 衬 着 那一 弯 雪白 的 膀子 ， 撂 在 被 外 ， 上面 明显 着 两个 金镯子 。,"Xiang-yun , by contrast , lay with her hank of jet-black hair tumbled untidily beside the pillow , a white arm with its two gold bracelets thrown carelessly outside the bedding and two white shoulders exposed above the peach-pink coverlet , which barely reached her armpits ."
宝玉 见 了 叹道 ： “ 睡觉 还是 不 老实 ！ 回来 风吹 了 ， 又 嚷 肩膀 疼 了 。 ” 一面 说 ， 一面 轻轻 的 替 他 盖 上 。,"' A tomboy , even in her sleep ! ' Bao-yu muttered ruefully as he gently drew the bedding up to cover her . ' She will get a draught on those shoulders , and next thing she will be complaining of a stiff neck ! '"
黛玉 早已 醒 了 ， 觉得 有人 ， 就 猜 是 宝玉 ， 翻身 一 看 ， 果然 是 他 。,"Dai-yu had by now awakened . She sensed that there was someone else in the room , and guessing that it must be Bao-yu , lifted her head up to look . Sure enough , it was he ."
因 说道 ： “ 这 早晚 就 跑过来 作 什么 ？ ”,' What are you doing here at this early hour ? '
宝玉 说道 ： “ 这 还 早 呢 ！ 你 起来 瞧瞧 罢 。 ”,' Early ? Get up and have a look and then tell me if you think it is early ! '
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 先 出去 ， 让 我们 起来 。 ”,"' You would better go outside a minute if you want us to get up , ' said Dai-yu ."
宝玉 出至 外间 。,Bao-yu went into the outer room .
黛玉 起来 ， 叫醒 湘云 ， 二人 都 穿 了 衣裳 。 宝玉 又 复 进来 ， 坐在 镜台 旁边 ， 只见 紫鹃 翠缕 进来 伏侍 梳洗 。,"Dai-yu got up as soon as he had gone out and roused Xiang-yun . When the two girls had slipped into some clothes , Bao-yu came inside again and sat himself down beside the dressing-table . Presently Nightingale and Kingfisher came in to help the girls with their toilet ."
湘云 洗 了 脸 ， 翠缕 便 拿 残 水 要 泼 ， 宝玉 道 ： “ 站 着 ， 我 就势 儿 洗 了 就 完 了 ， 省 了 又 过去 费事 。 ”,"Xiang-yun finished washing first . Kingfisher was on her way out to empty the basin , when Bao-yu called her back : ' Just a moment ! While you are about it I may as well wash too and save myself the trouble of going back to my own room . '"
说 着 ， 便 走 过来 ， 弯着腰 洗 了 两把 。,"He came over to where she stood , and bending his head down over the basin , scooped up two handfuls of water and began washing his face ."
紫鹃 递 过 香 肥皂 去 ， 宝玉 道 ： “ 不用 了 ， 这 盆 里 就 不少 了 。 ”,"Nightingale handed him some scented soap . ' It is all right , ' he said , ' there is lots in here already . '"
又 洗 了 两把 ， 便 要 手巾 。,Then he asked for a towel .
翠缕 撇嘴 笑 道 ： “ 还是 这个 毛病 儿 。 ”,"Kingfisher pursed her lips up derisively : ' You haven ' t changed much , have you ? '"
宝玉 也 不理 他 ， 忙忙 的 要 青盐 擦 了 牙 ， 漱 了 口 。,"Ignoring the sarcasm , he demanded crude salt to clean his teeth with , and after rubbing it all round them vigorously with a finger , he rinsed his mouth out with water ."
完毕 ， 见 湘云 已 梳完 了 头 ， 便 走 过来 笑 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 替 我 梳 梳 呢 。 ”,"That part of his toilet completed , he observed that Xiang-yun had just finished doing her hair and wandered over to where she was sitting . ' Coz dear , do my hair for me , will you ? '"
湘云 道 ： “ 这 可 不能 了 。 ”,"' I am afraid I can not , ' said Xiang-yun ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 你 先 时候 儿 怎么 替 我 梳 了 呢 ？ ”,"Bao-yu smiled coaxingly : ' Go on , be a dear ! You used to do it for me once . '"
湘云 道 ： “ 如今 我 忘 了 ， 不会 梳 了 。 ”,"' Well , I can not any longer , ' said Xiang-yun . ' I have forgotten how to . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 横竖 我 不 出门 ， 不过 打 几根 辫子 就 完 了 。 ”,"' It does not need very much doing to it , ' said Bao-yu . ' I am not going out anywhere today . Just a few plaits . '"
说 着 ， 又 千 “ 妹妹 ” 万 “ 妹妹 ” 的 央告 。 湘云 只得 扶 过 他 的 头 来 梳篦 。,"He continued to coax and wheedle until at last she gave in , and taking his head in her hands , sat him down in her place at the dressing-table and proceeded to comb and dress his hair ."
原来 宝玉 在家 并 不 戴冠 ， 只 将 四围 短发 编成 小辫 ， 往 顶心 发上 归 了 总 ， 编 一根 大 辫 ， 红 绦结 住 。 自发 顶 至 辫梢 ， 一路 四颗 珍珠 ， 下面 又 有 金 坠 脚儿 。,Bao-yu never wore any head-covering when he was at home . Instead he had his sidehair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the back . It was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head .
湘云 一面 编 着 ， 一面 说道 ： “ 这 珠子 只 三颗 了 ， 这 一颗 不是 了 。,"As Xiang-yun plaited , she noticed that a pearl appeared to be missing . ' What is happened to this clip ? ' she said ."
我 记得 是 一样 的 ， 怎么 少 了 一颗 ？ ”,' I am sure it used to be the same as the other three . Where has its pearl gone ? '
宝玉 道 ： “ 丢 了 一颗 。 ”,"' I lost it , ' said Bao-yu ."
湘云 道 ： “ 必定 是 外头 去 ， 掉下来 ， 叫 人 拣 了 去 了 ， 倒 便宜 了拣 的 了 。 ”,"' I expect it fell off somewhere outside and somebody picked it up , said Xiang-yun . ' Lucky old somebody ! '"
黛玉 旁边 冷笑 道 ： “ 也 不知 是 真 丢 ， 也 不知 是 给 了 人 镶 什么 戴 去 了 呢 ！ ”,' Who knows whether or not he really lost it ? ' said Dai-yu scoffingly . ' For all we know he may have given it to someone to have remounted as a keepsake ! '
宝玉 不答 ， 因 镜台 两边 都 是 妆奁 等物 ， 顺手 拿 起来 赏玩 ， 不觉 拈起 了 一 盒子 胭脂 ， 意欲 往 口边 送 ， 又 怕 湘云 说 。,"Bao-yu made no comment , but sat fiddling with the toilet articles that crowded the dressing-table on either side of the mirror . He picked up a pot of rouge , almost without realizing what he was doing , and sat with it poised in his hand , wanting to put it to his lips for a little taste , but afraid Xiang-yun would rebuke him ."
正 犹豫 间 ， 湘云 在 身后 伸 过手 来 ， “ 㕷 ” 的 一下 将 胭脂 从 他 手中 打落 ， 说道 ： “ 不长进 的 毛病 儿 ！ 多早晚 才 改 呢 ？ ”,"While he hesitated , Xiang-yun leaned forward from where she was sitting and administered a sharp slap to his hand , causing the rouge-pot to fall from it on to the dressing-table . ' Nathty habit ! ' she said . ' It is time you gave it up ! '"
一 语 未了 ， 只见 袭 人 进来 ， 见 这 光景 ， 知是 梳洗 过 了 ， 只得 回来 自己 梳洗 。,"The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Aroma entered . She concluded from the scene that met her eyes that Bao-yu had already completed his toilet , and went back again to attend to her own ."
忽 见 宝钗 走来 ， 因 问 ： “ 宝兄弟 那里 去 了 ？ ”,Soon after this Bao-chai dropped in . ' Where is Cousin Bao ? ' she asked .
袭 人 冷笑 道 ： “ ‘ 宝兄弟 ’ 那里 还有 在家 的 工夫 ！ ”,"' "" Cousin Bao "" has no time to spend in here nowadays , ' said Aroma bitterly ."
宝钗 听说 ， 心中 明白 。,Bao-chai immediately understood .
袭 人 又 叹 道 ： “ 姐妹 们 和 气 ， 也 有 个 分寸 儿 ， 也 没 个 黑家白日 闹 的 ！ 凭 人 怎么 劝 ， 都 是 耳旁风 。 ”,"Aroma sighed . ' I say nothing against being friendly , ' she said . ' But this hanging around there morning , noon and night is another matter . However , nothing I say makes any difference . It is just a waste of breath . '"
宝钗 听 了 ， 心中 暗 忖道 ： “ 倒别 看错 了 这个 丫头 ， 听 他 说话 ， 倒 有些 识见 。 ”,"Bao-chai was impressed . ' One must not underestimate this maid , ' she thought to herself . ' She is obviously a girl of some intelligence . '"
宝钗 便 在 炕上 坐 了 ， 慢慢 的 闲 言中 ， 套问 他 年纪 家乡 等 语 ， 留神 窥察 其 言语 志量 ， 深 可 敬爱 。,"And she sat down on the kang with her for a chat . In the course of conversation she inquired casually about her age , family , and various other personal matters , paying careful attention to her answers and gaining from them and from the tone in which they were uttered an increasing respect for this uneducated maid ."
一时 宝玉 来 了 ， 宝钗方 出去 。,"Presently Bao-yu came in , whereupon Bao-chai got up and left ."
宝玉 便 问 袭 人 道 ： “ 怎么 宝姐姐 和 你 说 的 这么 热闹 ， 见 我 进来 就 跑 了 ？ ”,Bao-yu commented on her departure : ' Cousin Bao-chai seemed to be very thick with you just now . Why should she suddenly rush off when I come into the room ? '
问 一声 不答 。 再 问 时 ， 袭 人 方道 ： “ 你 问 我 吗 ？ 我 不 知道 你们 的 原故 。 ”,"There was no reply , so he repeated his question . ' Are you asking me ? ' said Aroma . ' I do not know what reasons you all have for your comings and goings . '"
宝玉 听 了 这话 ， 见 他 脸上 气色 非 往日 可比 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 怎么 又 动 了 气 了 呢 ？ ”,The expression on her face as she uttered these words was angrier than he had ever seen her look before . He laughed . ' Oh dear ! Are you in a rage again ? '
袭 人 冷笑 道 ： “ 我 那里 敢 动气 呢 ？,Aroma laughed mirthlessly . ' It is not for the likes of me to get into rages .
只是 你 从今 别 进 这 屋子 了 ， 横竖 有人 伏侍 你 ， 再 不必 来 支使 我 。,"But I wish that from now on you would stop coming into this room . After all , you have got people to wait on you elsewhere . You do not really need my services ."
我 仍旧 还 伏侍 老太太 去 。 ”,"I shall go back to serving Her Old Ladyship , like I used to before . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 便 在 炕上 合眼 倒下 。,With that she closed her eyes and lay back upon the kang .
宝玉 见 了 这般 景况 ， 深 为 骇异 ， 禁不住 赶来 央告 。,Bao-yu was alarmed to see her in such a state and impulsively rushed over to the kang to soothe her .
那 袭 人 只管 合 着眼 不理 。,But Aroma kept her eyes tightly shut and would take no notice .
宝玉 没 了 主意 ， 因见 麝月 进来 ， 便 问道 ： “ 你 姐姐 怎么 了 ？ ”,Bao-yu did not know what to do . Just then Musk chanced to enter and he turned to her for help : ' What is up with Aroma ? '
麝月 道 ： “ 我 知道 么 ？ 问 你 自己 就 明白 了 。 ”,' How should I know ? ' said Musk . ' You would do better to ask yourself that question . '
宝玉 听说 ， 呆 了 一回 ， 自觉 无趣 ， 便 起身 暧道 ： “ 不理 我 罢 ！ 我 也 睡 去 。 ”,"Bao-yu was so taken aback that for a while he said nothing . Then , finding their combined hostility too much for him , he got up with a sigh from his suppliant position on the kang . ' All right , ignore me then ! I am going off to sleep , too . '"
说 着 ， 便 起身 下炕 ， 到 自己 床上 睡 下 。,And he slid from the kang and went off to his own bed to lie down .
袭 人 听 他 半日 无 动静 ， 微微 的 打 齁 ， 料 他 睡着 ， 便 起来 拿 了 一 领 斗篷 来 替 他 盖 上 。 只 听 “ 唿 ” 的 一声 ， 宝玉 便 掀 过去 ， 仍 合 着眼 装睡 。,"For a long time there was no sound from him except for a gentle snoring . Judging that he must be really asleep , Aroma rose from the kang and took a large travelling-cloak to cover him with . A moment later she heard a gentle thud . He had whipped it from him and thrown it to the floor as soon as her back was turned . But when she looked , his eyes were closed as before and he was still pretending to be asleep ."
袭 人 明知 其意 ， 便 点头 冷笑 道 ： “ 你 也 不用 生气 ， 从 今儿 起 ， 我 也 只当 是 个 哑吧 ， 再 不 说 你 一声 儿 了 ， 好不好 ？ ”,"The significance of the gesture did not escape her . She nodded slowly and regarded the feigned sleeper sarcastically : ' All right , then ! There is no need for you to get angry . From now on Ill just pretend I am dumb . I will not say another word of criticism . Will that satisfy you ? '"
宝玉 禁不住 起身 问道 ： “ 我 又 怎么 了 ？ 你 又 劝 我 ？,"This was too much for Bao-yu . He sat bolt upright on his bed . ' What am I supposed to have done this time ? And what is all this "" criticism "" you are talking about ?"
你 劝 也罢 了 ； 刚才 又 没劝 ， 我 一 进来 ， 你 就 不理 我 ， 赌气 睡 了 ， 我 还 摸不着 是 为什么 。 这 会子 你 又 说 我 恼 了 ！,"If you had been criticizing me it would not be so bad ; but when I came in just now , you did not say anything : you simply ignored me . You went and lay down in a huff without my having the faintest idea what it was all about , and now you accuse me of behaving unreasonably !"
我 何尝 听见 你 劝 我 的 是 什么 话 呢 ？ ”,I haven ' t heard a single peep out of you yet to explain what it is that you are angry about ! '
袭 人 道 ： “ 你 心里 还 不 明白 ？ 还 等 我 说 呢 ！ ”,"' Your own conscience ought to tell you that , ' said Aroma . ' You do not need me to tell you . '"
正 闹 着 ， 贾母 遣 人 来 叫 他 吃饭 ， 方 往前 边 来 ， 胡乱 吃 了 一碗 ， 仍 回 自己 房中 。,"They were still arguing when Grandmother Jia sent a servant round to summon him to lunch . He went off to the front apartment , but returned almost immediately after bolting a single bowlful of rice ."
只见 袭 人 睡 在 外头 炕 上 ， 麝月 在 旁 抹牌 。,He found Aroma asleep on the kang and Musk sitting beside her playing Patience with some dominoes .
宝玉 素知 他 两个 亲厚 ， 并 连 麝月 也 不理 ， 揭起 软帘 ， 自往 里间 来 。,"He had long known that Musk was a close ally of Aroma 's , so ignoring them both , he marched past them into the inner room , raising the door-curtain for himself as he passed through ."
麝月 只得 跟 进来 。 宝玉 便 推 他 出去 ， 说 ： “ 不敢 惊动 。 ”,"Musk followed him automatically , but he pushed her out : ' No , no , I would not presume to trouble you ! '"
麝月 便 笑 着 出来 ， 叫 了 两个 小丫头 进去 。,"She laughed and went back to her Patience , having first ordered a couple of the younger maids to wait on him in her stead ."
宝玉 拿 了 本书 ， 歪 着 看 了 半天 ， 因要 茶 ， 抬头 见 两个 小丫头 在 地下 站 着 ， 那个 大 两岁 清秀 些 的 ， 宝玉 问 他 道 ： “ 你 不是 叫 什么 ‘ 香 ’ 吗 ？ ”,"In the inner room Bao-yu took up a book and reclined on the kang to read . For a considerable while he remained engrossed in his reading . When eventually he did look up , intending to ask someone for some tea , he saw two little maids waiting there in silence , one of whom - evidently the older by a year or two - was an attractive , intelligent-looking girl . He addressed himself to her : ' Is not your name "" Nella "" something or other ? '"
那丫头 答道 ： “ 叫 ‘ 蕙 香 ’ 。 ”,' Citronella . '
宝玉 又 问 ： “ 是 谁 起 的 名字 ？ ”,' Citronella ? Who on earth gave you that name ?
惠香 道 ： “ 我 原 叫 ‘ 芸香 ’ ， 是 花大姐姐 改 的 。 ”,"' Aroma , sir . My real name is "" Soldanella "" , but Miss Aroma altered it to "" Citronella "" . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 正经 叫 ‘ 晦气 ’ 也罢 了 ， 又 ‘ 蕙 香 ’ 咧 ！,"' I do not know why she did not call you "" Citric Acid "" and have done with it , ' said Bao-yu ."
你 姐儿 几个 ？ ”,"' Citronella ! - How many girls are there in your family , Citronella ? '"
芸香 道 ： “ 四个 。 ”,"' Four , ' said Citronella ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 第几个 ？ ”,' And which of the four are you ? '
蕙 香 道 ： “ 第四 。 ”,' I am the youngest .
宝玉 道 ： “ 明日 就 叫 ‘ 四儿 ’ ， 不必 什么 ‘ 蕙 ’ 香 ‘ 兰 ’ 气 的 。,"' Right ! ' said Bao-yu . ' In future you will be called "" Number Four "" . We are not going to have any more of these floral fragrances around here ."
那 一个 配比 这些 花儿 ？ 没 的 玷辱 了 好名 好姓 的 ！ ”,It is an insult to decent scents and flowers to give their names to you lot ! '
一面 说 ， 一面 叫 他 倒 了 茶 来 。,Then he asked her to pour him some tea .
袭 人 和 麝月 在 外间 听 了 半日 ， 只管 悄悄的 抿着嘴 儿 笑 。,"Listening attentively in the outer room , ' Flowers ' Aroma and her Musky ally - for whose ears this gibe was intended - were nearly bursting themselves in their efforts not to laugh ."
这 一日 ， 宝玉 也 不出 房 ， 自己 闷闷 的 ， 只不过 拿 书 解闷 ， 或 弄 笔墨 ， 也 不 使唤 众人 ， 只 叫 四儿 答应 。,"All that day Bao-yu stayed in his own room , seeing no one . It was gloomy on his own , with nothing but reading and a little writing for amusement , but he refused to make use of any of his usual attendants and would have only "" Number Four "" to wait on him ."
谁知 这 四儿 是 个 乖巧 不过 的 丫头 ， 见 宝玉 用 他 ， 他 就 变尽 方法 儿 笼络 宝玉 。,"Though he did not realize it , she was a designing little minx and endeavoured by every artifice at her command to get her hooks into him while she had the chance ."
至 晚饭 后 ， 宝玉 因 吃 了 两 杯酒 ， 眼伤 耳热 之 余 ， 若 往日 则 有 袭 人 等 大家 嘻笑 有兴 ； 今日 却 冷清清 的 ， 一 人 对 灯 ， 好 没 兴趣 。,"After dinner Bao-yu came back flushed and slightly tipsy , having taken a few cups of wine with his meal . Normally this would have been the occasion for an evening of hilarity with Aroma and the rest , but today he would have to sit by his lamp alone in cheerless isolation . The prospect was a depressing one ."
待 要 赶 了 他们 去 ， 又 怕 他们 得 了 意 ， 以后 越来 劝 了 ； 若 拿出 作上 人 的 光景 镇唬 他们 ， 似乎 又 太 无情 了 。,"Yet if he were to go running after her , it would seem too much like a capitulation , and her nagging would thenceforth become insufferable . On the other hand , to frighten her into some sort of compliance by asserting his mastery over her would be heartless ."
说不得 横 着 心 ： “ 只当 他们 死 了 ， 横竖 自家 也 要 过 的 。 ”,"There was nothing else for it : he would just have to grin and bear it . ' Suppose they were all dead , ' he said to himself . ' I should have to make do on my own somehow or other ! '"
如此 一 想 ， 却 倒 毫无 牵挂 ， 反 能 怡然 自悦 。,The thought was strangely comforting . He was able to stop worrying . He even began to feel quite cheerful .
因命 四儿 剪烛 烹茶 ， 自己 看 了 一回 《 南华 经 》 ， 至 外篇 《 胠 箧 》 一则 ， 其文 日 ：,"Having instructed Number Four to trim up the lamp and brew him a pot of tea , he settled down to a volume of Zhuang-xi . Presently he came to the following passage in the chapter called Rifling Trunks :"
… … 故 绝圣弃智 ， 大盗 乃止 ； 擿 玉 毁 珠 ， 小盗 不 起 。,"Away then with saints and wise men , and the big thieves will cease from despoiling . Discard your jades , destroy your pearls , and the little thieves will cease from pilfering ."
焚符破玺 ， 而 民朴 鄱 ； 剖斗 折衡 ， 而 民 不争 ； 残 天下 之 圣 法 ， 而 民始 可与 论议 。,"Burn your tallies , smash your seals , and the common people will revert to their natural integrity . Break all the bushels and snap all the steelyards , and they will have no further grounds for dispute . Obliterate those sacred laws ' by which the world is governed , and you will find yourself at lastable to reason with them ."
擢乱 六律 ， 殚绝竽瑟 ， 塞 瞽 旷之耳 ， 而 天下 始 人 含其聪矣 ； 灭 文章 ， 散 五彩 ， 胶离 朱之目 ， 而 天下 始 人 含其明 矣 ； 毁绝 钩 绳 ， 而 弃 规矩 ， 攦 工 垂 之 指 ， 而 天下 始 人 含其巧矣 。,"If you confuse the pitch-pipes , breakup the organs , unstring the zithers and stop up Shi Kuang 's ears , people will begin to make proper use of their own hearing ifyou abolish all intricacy of design and brillianeyef colouring and glue up Li Zhu 's eyes , people will begin to make proper use of their own eyesight . And if you destroy your arcs and lines , throw away your compasses and set-squares and break the fingers of Chui the Cunning , people will begin to make proper use of their own skill . . ."
看 至此 ， 意趣 洋洋 ， 趁着 酒兴 ， 不禁 提笔 续 曰 ：,"The words wonderfully suited his present mood . He read no further . Impulsively picking up a writing-brush , and with the inspiration lent him by his tipsiness , he added the following lines in the margin :"
焚花散 麝 ， 而 闺阁 始 人 含 其 劝 矣 ； 戕宝 钗 之 仙姿 ， 灰 黛玉 之 灵窍 ， 丧灭 情意 ， 而 闺阁 之 美恶 始相 类 矣 。,"Away then with Musk and Aroma , and the female tongue will cease from nagging . Discard Bao-chai 's heavenly beauty , destroy Dai-yu 's divine intelligence , utterly abolish all tender feelings , and the female heart will cease from enzy ."
彼 含 其 劝 ， 则 无 参商之虞 矣 ； 戕其 仙姿 ， 无 恋爱 之 心 矣 ； 灰其灵窍 ， 无 才思 之 情 矣 。,If the female tongue ceases from nagging there will be no further fear of quarrels and estrangements ; if Bao-chai 's heavenly beauty is discarded there will be no further grounds for tender admiration ; and if Dai-yu 's dicine intelligence is destroyed there will be no further cause for romantic imaginings .
彼钗 、 玉 、 花 、 麝者 ， 皆 张其罗 而 邃 其 穴 ， 所以 迷惑 缠陷 天下 者 也 。,"These Bao-chais , Dai-yus , Aromas and Musks spread their nets and dig their pits , and all the world are bewitched and ensnared by them ."
续毕 ， 掷 笔 就寝 。,"Having written these lines , he threw down the brush and went straight to bed ."
头 刚 着 枕 ， 便 忽然 睡 去 ， 一夜 竟 不知 所之 ， 直至 天明 方醒 。 翻身 看 时 ， 只见 袭 人 和 衣 睡 在 衾 上 。,"He was asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow and remained dead to the world throughout the whole of that night . Waking with the first light next morning , he sat up in bed to find Aroma lying fully clothed beside him outside the covers ."
宝玉 将 昨日 的 事 ， 已 付之度外 ， 便 推 他 说道 ： “ 起来 好生 睡 ， 看冻 着 。 ”,"He roused her with a gentle shake , all yesterday 's unpleasantness now quite forgotten : ' Go to bed properly ! You will get cold , sleeping like that ! '"
原来 袭 人 见 他 无明无夜 和 姐妹 们 鬼混 ， 若真 劝 他 ， 料 不能 改 ， 故用 柔情 以 警 之 ， 料 他 不过 半日 片刻 ， 仍旧 好 了 ， 不想 宝玉 竟不 回转 ， 自己 反 不得 主意 ， 直 一夜 没 好生 睡 。,"Aroma had not , on the day previous to this , openly criticized Bao-yu for disporting himself at all hours of the day and night with his girl cousins because she knew from experience that criticism was powerless to change him . To alert him to the error of his ways she had instead adopted a more passive approach . She had confidently expected this new method to produce a speedy repentance , followed by a swift return to normal relations ; so that when , contrary to her expectation , a whole day went by without his having manifested the looked-for change of heart , she was left with no further resources , and as a consequence had been too worried to sleep properly for the greater part of that night ."
今 忽 见 宝玉 如此 ， 料 是 他 心意 回转 ， 便 索性 不理 他 。,"But now here he was addressing her normally once more . He must have undergone a change of heart during the night . She forced herself to ignore him still , in order to drive the lesson home"
宝玉 见 他 不 应 ， 便 伸手 替 他 解衣 ， 刚 解开 钮子 ， 被 袭 人 将 手 推开 ， 又 自扣 了 。,"Meeting with no response , Bao-yu reached out his hand to help her get undressed ; but he had got no further than undoing the first button when she pushed his hand away and did it up again ."
宝玉 无法 ， 只得 拉 他 的 手 笑 道 ： “ 你 到底 怎么 了 ？ ”,He was at a loss to know what to do with her . With a gentle smile he took her by the hand : ' Now - what is the matter ? '
连问 几声 ， 袭 人 睁眼 说道 ： “ 我 也 不 怎么着 。,He had to repeat the question several times . She fixed her eyes on him angrily : ' Nothing 's the matter .
你 睡醒 了 ， 快 过 那边 梳洗 去 。,"But now you are awake , had not you better hurry over to the other place to get washed ?"
再 迟 了 ， 就 赶不上 了 。 ”,"If you delay much longer , you might not be in time . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 过 那里 去 ？ ”,' What other place ? ' said Bao-yu .
袭 人 冷笑 道 ： “ 你 问 我 ， 我 知道 吗 ？,Aroma smiled coldly . ' Why ask me ? How should I know ?
你 爱 过 那里 去 就 过 那里 去 。,Go wherever you like for your toilet !
从今 咱们 两个 人 撂 开手 ， 省 的 鸡生鹅 斗 ， 叫 别人 笑话 。,"Let's make a clean break from now on , you and I , and perhaps we will have a bit less of all this bickering and making ourselves ridiculous in front of the others ."
横竖 那边 腻 了 过来 ， 这边 又 有 什么 ‘ 四儿 ’ ‘ 五儿 ’ 伏侍 你 。,"I mean to say , even if you get tired of going there , you have always got your Number Fours and Number Fives back here to wait on you ."
我们 这 起 东西 ， 可是 ‘ 自 玷辱 了 好名 好 姓 ’ 的 ！ ”,"But as for the rest of us : even our names are "" an insult to decent scents and flowers "" ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 今儿 还 记 着 呢 ？ ”,Bao-yu laughed : ' Do you still remember that ? '
袭 人 道 ： “ 一百年 还 记 着 呢 ！,' I will remember that if I live to be a hundred ! ' said Aroma .
比 不得 你 ， 拿 着 我 的话 当耳旁风 ， 夜里 说 了 ， 早起 就 忘 了 。 ”,' I am not like you : treating everything I say like so much wind and forgetting in the morning what you said yourself the night before ! '
宝玉 见 他 娇嗔 满面 ， 情 不可 禁 ， 便 向 枕边 拿 起 一根 玉簪 来 ， 一 跌 两段 ， 说道 ： “ 我 再 不 听 你 说 ， 就 和 这 簪子 一样 ！ ”,There was something about her pretty face suffused with anger that Bao-yu found infinitely touching . He snatched up a jade hairpin that was lying beside the pillow and snapped it in two . ' So be it with me if I ever fail to listen to you again ! ' he said .
袭 人 忙 的 拾 了 簪子 ， 说道 ： “ 大 早起 ， 这 是 何苦 来 ？,"' What a way to carry on at this hour of the morning ! ' said Aroma , hurriedly picking up the pieces ."
听 不 听 在 你 ， 也 不值 的 这么着 呀 。 ”,' Whether you listen to me or not is up to you . There is no need to get into such a state about it ! '
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 那里 知道 我 心里 的 急 呢 ？ ”,"' You do not know how worried you make me , ' said Bao-yu ."
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 你 也 知道 着急 么 ？,"' So you feel worried , do you ? ' said Aroma smiling ."
你 可 知道 我 心里 是 怎么着 ？ — — 快 洗脸 去 罢 。 ”,"' Now perhaps you will have some idea what Ifeel like most of the time ! - Come on , let's get washed ! '"
说 着 ， 二人 方 起来 梳洗 。,With that the two of them got up and began their toilet .
宝玉 往 上房 去后 ， 谁知 黛玉 走来 ， 见 宝玉 不在 房中 ， 因 翻弄 案 上书 看 。,"Later , after Bao-yu had gone off to the front apartment , Dai-yu looked in unexpectedly , and not finding Bao-yu in , began idly turning over the books that were lying on his desk ."
可巧 便 翻出 昨儿 的 《 庄子 》 来 ， 看见 宝玉 所续 之 处 ， 不觉 又 气 又 笑 ， 不禁 也 提笔 续 了 一绝云 ：,"Chancing to light on the volume of Zhuang-zi that he had been reading the night before , her eye was drawn to the lines he had written in the margin . They both vexed and amused her , and she could not resist picking up a writing-brush and adding the following quatrain on the remaining blank space :"
无端 弄笔 是 何人 ？,"What wretch would here , with scurrile pen ,"
剿袭 《 南华 》 庄子 文 。,"The text of Zhuang-xi plagiarize ,"
不悔 自家 无 见识 ，,"And , heedless of his own great faulls ,"
却 将 丑语 诋 他人 ！,Fright others with his wicked lies ?
题 毕 ， 也 往 上房 来 见 贾母 ， 后往 王夫人 处来 。,"That done , she went to the front apartment to see Grandmother Jia , and from there on to Lady Wang 's ."
谁知 凤姐 之 女 大 姐儿 病 了 ， 正乱 着 请 大夫 诊脉 。,She found everyone at Lady Wang 's in a great to-do . Xi-feng 's baby daughter was ill . The doctor had been called and had just finished taking her pulses .
大夫 说 ： “ 替 太太 奶奶 们 道喜 ， 姐儿 发热 是 见 喜 了 ， 并非 别症 。 ”,' Convey my congratulations to Her Ladyship and Mrs Lian ' - the doctor 's diagnosis was couched in the strange language which custom decrees in such cases - ' I am happy to inform them that the little girl 's sickness is the small-pox ! '
王夫人 凤姐 听 了 ， 忙 遣 人 问 ： “ 可 好不好 ？ ”,Lady Wang and Xi-feng at once sent back to inquire whether the child was in any danger .
大夫 回 道 ： “ 症 虽 险 ， 却 顺 ， 倒 还 不妨 。,"The doctor made the following reply : ' Variola is , of course , a dangerous disease , but provided there are no complications , most cases of it are recuperable ."
预备 桑虫 、 猪尾 要紧 。 ”,"Let the ladies lay in a plentiful supply of sanguis caudae , or pig 's tail blood , and plenty of essence of mulberry-worm . Applied externally these will ensure a satisfactory development of the pustules . '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 登时 忙 将 起来 ： 一面 打扫 房屋 ， 供奉 “ 痘疹 娘娘 ” ： 一面 传与 家人 忌 煎炒 等物 ； 一面 命 平儿 打点 铺盖 衣服 与 贾琏 隔 房 ； 一面 又 拿 大红 尺头 给 奶子 丫头 亲近 人 等 裁 衣裳 。,"Xi-feng immediately became very busy . A room had to be swept out and prepared for the worship of the Smallpox Goddess . Orders had to be given to the servants to avoid the use of all fried and sautéed cookery . Patience had to be told to move Jia Lian 's clothes and bedding to a room outside - for sexual abstinence , too , was enjoined on the parents of the sufferer . A length of dark-red cloth had to be procured and made up into a dress for the child by the combined labours of the nurses , maids and female relations most closely associated with it ."
外面 打扫 净室 ， 款留 两位 医生 ， 轮流 斟酌 诊脉 下药 ， 十二日 不放家 去 。,"Finally , a ritually purified room had to be made ready for the two doctors who would take it in turns to examine the little patient and make up her medicines , and who would not be permitted to return to their own homes until the customary period of twelve days had elapsed ."
贾琏 只得 搬出 外 书房 来 安歇 。 凤姐 和 平儿 都 跟 王夫人 日日 供奉 “ 娘娘 ” 。,"These arrangements having been completed , Jia Lian went off to the outer study which was from now on to be his bedroom , while Xi-feng and Patience joined Lady Wang in the daily worship and propitiation of the Smallpox Goddess ."
那 贾琏 只 离 了 凤姐 ， 便 要 寻事 ， 独寝 了 两夜 ， 十分 难熬 ， 只得 暂将 小厮 内 清俊 的 选来 出火 。,Jia Lian was the sort of man who will begin getting up to mischief the moment he takes leave of his wife . After only a couple of nights sleeping on his own he began to find abstinence extremely irksome and was reduced to slaking his fires on the more presentable of his pages .
不想 荣国府 内 有 一个 极 不成材 破烂 酒头 厨子 ， 名叫 多 官儿 ， 因 他 懦弱 无能 ， 人 都 叫 他 作 “ 多 浑虫 ” 。,"But other relief was at hand . Among the domestic staff at the Rong-guo mansion was a certain drunken , dilapidated cook , by surname Duo , who , because of his weakness of character and general uselessness , had acquired the nickname of ' Droopy Duo ' ."
二年 前 ， 他 父亲 给 他 娶 了 个 媳妇 ， 今年 才 二十岁 ， 也 有 几分 人材 ， 又 兼 生性 轻薄 ， 最喜 拈花惹草 。,"Two years previous to this date Droopy 's father had provided him with a wife . She was now just turned twenty , a fine , good-looking young wanton , always eager to throw herself at whatever partners opportunity might place in her way ."
多 浑虫 又 不 理论 ， 只有 酒 有 肉 有钱 ， 就 诸事 不管 了 ， 所以 宁荣二 府 之 人 ， 都 得 入手 。,Droopy Duo raised no objection to her infidelities . As long as he had meat to eat and wine to drink and money in his pocket he saw no reason to concern himself about anything else . Consequently there was scarcely an able-bodied male in the Ning-guo and Rong-guo mansions who had not at one time or another sampled her wares .
因 这 媳妇 妖调 异常 ， 轻狂 无比 ， 众人 都 叫 他 “ 多 姑娘 儿 ” 。,Because of her pneumatic charms and omnivorous promiscuity this voluptuous young limmer was referred to by all and sundry as ' the Mattress ' .
如今 贾琏 在外 熬煎 ， 往日 也 见 过 这 媳妇 ， 垂涎 久 了 ， 只是 内 惧 娇妻 ， 外惧 娈童 ， 不曾 得手 ， — — 那 多 姑娘 儿 也 久 有意 于 贾琏 ， 只 恨 没 空儿 ， 今 闻 贾琏 挪 在外 书房 来 ， 他 便 没事 也 要 走 三四趟 ， 招惹 的 贾琏 似 饥鼠 一般 ， 少不得 和 心腹 小厮 计议 ， 许 以 金帛 ， 焉 有 不 允 之 理 ， 况 都 和 这 媳妇 子 是 旧交 ， 一 说 便成 。,"Jia Lian , now separated from the wife of his bosom and fairly frying with unsatisfied desires , had for some time past been aware of the Mattress 's charms ; but though his mouth had long watered to enjoy them , what with fear of his jealous young wife on the one hand and fear of his fancy boys on the other , he had so far found no opportunity of approaching her . The Mattress , too , had for some time past had her eye on Jia Lian , and it was a source of regret to her that he had so far proved unapproachable . Learning that he had now moved to his study outside , she managed to find excuses for passing by that way three or four times in a day , provoking Jia Lian to a pitch of frantic eagerness only to be compared with that of a starving rat confronted by some food . He was obliged to seek the advice of his pages and to promise them rich rewards if they could procure her for his pleasure . The pages were ready enough to oblige - the more so as they were themselves old customers of hers - and the request for an assignation was no sooner made than granted ."
是夜 ， 多 浑虫 醉倒在 炕 ， 二 鼓 人定 ， 贾琏便 溜进来 相会 ， 一 见面 ， 早已 神魂 失据 ， 也 不及 情谈款 叙 ， 便 宽衣 动作 起来 。,"At about ten o'clock that night , when all were abed and Droopy Duo lay collapsed on the kang in drunken slumbers , Jia Lian slipped noiselessly into the room for his prearranged meeting with the Mattress . The mere sight of her proved so potent a stimulant that without wasting any time on tender preliminaries , he took down his trousers and set to work at once ."
谁知 这 媳妇 子 有 天生 的 奇趣 ： 一经 男子 挨身 ， 便 觉 遍体 筋骨 瘫软 ， 使 男子 如 卧绵上 ； 更 兼 淫态 浪言 ， 压倒 娼妓 。,"Now this wife of Duo 's had a physical peculiarity which was that as soon as the man 's body came into contact with her own she felt a delicious melting sensation invading her limbs , rendering her body soft and yielding to that of her partner , so that he had the impression of lying on a heap of down ; and in addition to this natural endowment she knew more tricks of posture and more ways of exciting a man with murmured lewdnesses and amorous cries than a professional prostitute ."
贾琏 此时 恨不得 化 在 他 身上 。 那 媳妇 子 故作 浪语 ， 在 下 说道 ： “ 你们 姐儿 出 花儿 ， 供 着 娘娘 ， 你 也 该 忌 两日 ， 倒 为 我 腌臜 了 身子 ， 快 离 了 我 这里 罢 。 ”,"As Jia Lian lay on top of her , wishing he could melt into her body from sheer excess of pleasure , she began to exercise this last accomplishment . ' Your little girl 's got the smallpox , ' she murmured . ' While they are worshipping the Goddess , you are supposed to keep yourself pure . Naughty man ! You are making yourself unclean because of me . You must leave me ! Go away ! '"
贾琏 一面 大 动 ， 一面 喘吁吁 答道 ： “ 你 就是 ‘ 娘娘 ’ ！ 那里 还管 什么 ‘ 娘娘 ’ 呢 ！ ”,"Jia Lian 's movements became more violent . ' You are my only goddess ! ' he said , panting heavily . ' I care for no other goddess but you ! '"
那 媳妇 子越浪 起来 ， 贾琏 亦 丑态毕露 。,At this the Mattress began to grow even more reckless in her incitements and Jia Lian to reveal the more disgusting of his sexual accomplishments .
一时 事毕 ， 不免 盟山誓海 ， 难舍难分 。,"They lay a long time together when it was over , exchanging oaths and promises , unable to break apart ."
自 此后 ， 遂 成 相契 。,From that day onwards there was a secret understanding between them .
一日 ， 大姐 毒 尽 癍 回 ， 十二日 后 送 了 “ 娘娘 ” ， 合家 祭天 祀祖 ， 还愿 焚香 ， 庆贺 放赏 已 毕 ， 贾琏 仍复 搬进 卧室 。,"A day arrived when the smallpox poison had spent itself and Baby 's pustules showed signs of drying up . After the twelfth day the Smallpox Goddess was ceremoniously ushered off the premises , the entire family joined in a service of thanksgiving to Heaven and the ancestors , and there was much burning of incense in discharge of vows made on the child 's behalf by various of its members , and much exchanging of congratulations and paying out of rewards ."
见 了 凤姐 ， 正是 俗语 云 ： “ 新婚 不如 远别 ” ， 是夜 更 有 无限 恩爱 ， 自不必说 。,"When all this was over , Jia Lian returned once more to the matrimonial couch . ' A night after absence is better than a wedding night ' as the proverb crudely puts it , and certainly the affection shown that night by Jia Lian for his lady was of more than usual intensity ."
次日 早起 ， 凤姐 往 上 屋里 去后 ， 平儿 收拾 外边 拿 进来 的 衣服 铺盖 ， 不 承望 枕套 中 抖出 一 绺 青丝 来 ， 平儿 会意 ， 忙 藏 在 袖内 ， 便 走到 这边 房里 ， 拿出 头发 来 ， 向 贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 这 是 什么 东西 ？ ”,"Early next morning , when Xi-feng had gone off to Grandmother Jia 's , Patience began putting away the clothes and bedding that had been brought in from the outer study . To her surprise she felt something strange in the cover of Jia Lian 's head-rest , and after groping inside it , fished out a black , silky tress of woman 's hair . Quick to understand its significance , she hid it in her sleeve and going across to the other room , showed it to Jia Lian and asked him what it was ."
贾琏 一 见 ， 连忙 上来 要 抢 ， 平儿 就 跑 ， 被 贾琏 一把 揪住 ， 按 在 炕上 ， 从 手中 来夺 。,"As soon as he saw the hair , Jia Lian rushed forward to snatch it from her . She darted away , but he seized hold of her , and forcing her on to the kang , attempted to wrest it from her grasp"
平儿 笑 道 ： “ 你 这个 没良心 的 ， 我 好意 瞒 着 他 来 问 你 ， 你 倒 赌 利害 ！,"' Mean thing ! ' said Patience . ' After I have gone to the trouble of asking you about it behind her back , you have to start being rough ! '"
等 我 回来 告诉 了 ， 看 你 怎么着 ？ ”,
贾琏 听说 ， 忙 陪笑 央求 道 ： “ 好人 ， 你 赏 我 罢 ！,
我 再 不敢 利害 了 。 ”,
一 语 未了 ， 忽 听 凤姐 声音 ， 贾琏 此时 松 了 不是 ， 抢 又 不是 ， 只 叫 ： “ 好人 ， 别 叫 他 知道 ！ ”,"Just at that moment they heard Xi-feng coming . Jia Lian did not know whether to let go of Patience or make a final effort to obtain the hair . Finally , with a muttered entreaty , he released her : ' Angel ! Do not let her know ! '"
平儿 才 起身 ， 凤姐 已 走进 来 ， 叫 平儿 ： “ 快 开 匣子 ， 替 太太 找 样子 。 ”,Patience managed to get up just as Xi-feng was entering . ' Quick ! ' said Xi-feng . ' Open up the chest and find that pattern for Her Ladyship ! '
平儿忙 答应 了 ， 找 时 ， 凤姐 见 了 贾琏 ， 忽然 想 起来 ， 便 问 平儿 ： “ 前日 拿出 去 的 东西 都 收进来 了 没有 ？ ”,"' Yes madam , ' said Patience . While Patience was looking for the pattern , Xi-feng caught sight of Jia Lian and suddenly thought of something else . ' Have we got the things back from the outer study yet ? '"
平儿 道 ： “ 收进来 了 。 ”,"' Yes , ' said Patience ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 少 什么 不少 ？ ”,' Was there anything missing ? '
平儿 道 ： “ 细细 查 了 ， 没少 一件 儿 。 ”,"' No , ' said Patience . ' I went through them very carefully , but there was nothing missing . '"
凤姐 又 道 ： “ 可 多 什么 ？ ”,' Was there anything there that should not have been ? '
平儿 笑 道 ： “ 不少 就 罢了 ， 那里 还有 多 出来 的 分儿 ？ ”,Patience laughed . ' Is not it enough that there was nothing missing ? Why should there be anything extra ? '
凤姐 又 笑 道 ： “ 这 十几天 ， 难保 干净 ， 或者 有 相好 的 丢下 什么 戒指 儿 、 汗巾 儿 ， 也 未 可定 ？ ”,"Xi-feng laughed , too . ' He was nearly a fortnight outside . I would not bank on his having kept himself clean all that time . There might have been something left behind by one of his little friends : a ring or a sash or something . '"
一席话 ， 说 的 贾琏 脸 都 黄 了 ， 在 凤姐 身 背后 ， 只 望 着 平儿 “ 杀鸡 儿 抹脖子 ” 的 使眼色 儿 ， 求 他 遮盖 。,"Jia Lian turned pale with fright . He grimaced piteously at Patience from behind Xifeng 's back , and drawing a finger across his throat , silently entreated her to keep her discovery hidden ."
平儿 只 装 看不见 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 怎么 我 的 心就 和 奶奶 一样 ！,"Patience affected not to notice him . ' It is funny you should say that , Mrs Lian ."
我 就 怕 有 原故 ， 留神 搜 了 一 搜 ， 竟 一点 破绽 儿 都 没有 。,"Exactly the same thought occurred to me ; but though I went through his things very carefully , I did not find anything suspicious ."
奶奶 不 信 ， 亲自 搜 搜 。 ”,"If you do not believe me , you can have a look yourself . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 傻丫头 ！,' Silly girl ! ' said Xi-feng .
他 就 有 这些 东西 ， 肯叫 咱们 搜 着 ？ ”,' Do you imagine that if there were really anything there he would let us look ? '
说 着 ， 拿 了 样子 出去 了 。,And taking the pattern from her she went out again .
平儿 指着 鼻子 ， 摇着头 儿 ， 笑 道 ： “ 这件 事 你 该 怎么 谢 我 呢 ？ ”,Patience pointed a finger at her own nose and wagged her head from side to side . ' How are you going to thank me for that ? '
喜 的 贾琏 眉开眼笑 ， 跑过来 搂 着 ， “ 心肝 乖乖 儿肉 ” 的 便 乱叫 起来 。,' You are a sweet little darling ! ' He beamed delightedly and lunged forward to embrace her .
平儿 手里 拿 着 头发 ， 笑 道 ： “ 这 是 一辈子 的 把柄 儿 。 好 便 罢 ， 不好 咱们 就 抖出来 。 ”,"Patience dangled the hair in front of him : ' You will have to watch your step from now on , ' she said . ' Now I have got something to keep you in order with . If you misbehave . . . ! '"
贾琏 笑 着 央告 道 ： “ 你 好生 收 着 罢 ， 千万 可别 叫 他 知道 ！ ”,"' All right , you look after it , then . But ' - his tone became entreating - ' do not , whatever you do , let her find out ! '"
嘴里 说 着 ， 瞅 他 不 堤防 ， 一把 就 抢过来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你 拿 着 到底 不好 ， 不如 我 烧 了 就 完 了 事 了 。 ”,"He said this to put her off her guard . As soon as her defences were relaxed he made a quick grab and snatched it from her . ' Perhaps you would better not have it , after all , ' he said with a grin of triumph . ' If I have it I can burn it , and then it is all over and done with . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 掖 在 靴 掖 子 内 。,He stowed the hair in the side of his boot as he said this .
平儿 咬牙 道 ： “ 没良心 的 ， ‘ 过 了 河儿 就 拆桥 ’ ， 明儿 还 想 我 替 你 撤谎 呢 ！ ”,"Patience clenched her teeth in anger . ' You are mean ! Burn the bridge when you are safely over the river - that is your way , is not it ? All right then , you need not expect me to tell lies for you in future ! '"
贾琏 见 他 娇俏 动情 ， 便 搂 着 求欢 ， 平儿 夺手 跑 出来 ， 急 的 贾琏 弯着腰 恨 道 ： “ 死 促狭 小 娼妇 儿 ！ 一定 浪 上 人 的 火 来 ， 他 又 跑 了 。 ”,"In Jia Lian 's lascivious eyes her anger made her adorable . He felt himself becoming excited , and throwing his arms around her , he asked her to let him take her . But Patience struggled free and ran from the room , leaving him doubled up in a fury of frustrated desire . ' Little cock-teaser ! ' he shouted after her . You deliberately provoked me , and now you run away ! '"
平儿 在 窗外 笑 道 ： “ 我 浪 我 的 ， 谁 叫 你 动火 ？,' Who provoked you ? ' Patience giggled from outside the window . ' You should not be so randy !
难道 图 你 舒服 ， 叫 他 知道 了 ， 又 不 待见 我 呀 ！ ”,Do you expect me to make the Mistress hate me just for the sake of making you feel comfortable ? '
贾琏 道 ： “ 你 不用 怕 他 ， 等 我 性子 上来 ， 把 这 ‘ 醋罐子 ’ 打 个 稀烂 ， 他 才 认 的 我 呢 ！,"' You need not worry about her , ' said Jia Lian . ' One of these days when I get my temper up I am going to lay into that jealous bitch and break every bone in her body . Then perhaps she will know who is master round here ."
他 防 我 象 防贼 的 似的 ， 只许 他 和 男人 说话 ， 不许 我 和 女人 说话 。,"She watches me like a bloody thief . She can talk to men when she likes , but I am not supposed to talk to women , oh no !"
我 和 女人 说话 ， 略 近 些 ， 他 就 疑惑 ； 他 不论 小叔子 、 侄儿 、 大 的 、 小 的 ， 说说笑笑 ， 就 都 使得 了 ！,"If I am talking to a woman and just happen to get a bit close , she immediately starts suspecting something . But if she wants to go chattering and larking around with Bao or Rong or any other bloody male on the premises , that is supposed to be all right !"
以后 我 也 不许 他 见 人 ！ ”,You wait ! One of these days I will stop her seeing anyone at all ! '
平儿 道 ： “ 他 防 你 使得 ， 你 醋 他 使不得 ， 他 不 笼络 着 人 ， 怎么 使唤 呢 ？ 你 行动 就是 坏心 ， 连 我 也 不 放心 ， 别说 他 呀 。 ”,"' She is every right to watch you , ' said Patience , and you have no right at all to be jealous of her . She is always been perfectly straight and above board where men are concerned ; but you - whatever you do you have got something nasty in mind ! You make even me worried , never mind about her ! '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 哦 ！ 也罢 了 么 ！,"' Oh , shut up ! ' said Jia Lian ."
都 是 你们 行 的 是 ， 我 行动 儿 就 存 坏心 ！,"' You are all perfect , are not you ? It is just me that is always up to something nasty !"
多早晚 才 叫 你们 都 死 在 我 手里 呢 。 ”,One of these days I will make a clean sweep of the lot of you ! '
正说 着 ， 凤姐 走进 院 来 ， 因见 平儿 在 窗外 ， 便 问道 ： “ 要 说话 ， 怎么 不在 屋里 说 ， 又 跑 出来 隔 着 窗户 闹 ， 这 是 什么 意思 ？ ”,"Just at that moment Xi-feng stepped into the courtyard and saw Patience standing outside the window . ' If you want to talk , ' she said , ' why not talk inside the room ? What is the idea of running outside and bawling through the window ? '"
贾琏 在内 接口 道 ： “ 你 可 问 他么 ， 倒 象 屋里 有 老虎 吃 他 呢 ！ ”,' Do not ask her ! ' said Jia Lian 's voice from inside . ' She thinks there is a tiger in the room and she is afraid of being eaten ! '
平儿 道 ： “ 屋里 一个 人 没有 ， 我 在 他 跟前 作 什么 ？ ”,"' He is in there on his own , ' said Patience . ' What should I be doing in there with him ? '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 没 人才 便宜 呢 ！ ”,"' All the more reason for being in there , I should have thought , if he is on his own , ' said Xi-feng , smiling rather spitefully ."
平儿 听说 ， 便 道 ： “ 这话 是 说 我么 ？ ”,' Is that remark intended for me ? ' said Patience .
凤姐 便 笑 道 ： “ 不说 你 说 谁 ？ ”,' Who else ? ' said Xi-feng .
平儿 道 ： “ 别 叫 我 说出 好话 来 了 ！ ” 说 着 ， 也 不 打 帘子 ， 赌气 往 那边 去 了 。,"' You will make me say something I shall feel sorry for in a minute , ' said Patience ; and instead of standing aside and raising the door-blind for her mistress , she entered ahead of her , dropped it rudely in her face , and marched angrily through the sitting-room to one of the rooms at the back ."
凤姐 自己 掀 帘 进来 ， 说道 ： “ 平儿 丫头 疯魔 了 ， 这 蹄子 认真 要 降伏 起 我 来 了 ！ 仔细 你 的 皮 。 ”,"' What is the matter with Patience ? The girl 's gone mad ! ' said Xi-feng when she had raised the blind again and let herself in . ' I really do believe she is trying to displace me . You would better look out , my friend : I will have the hide off you ! '"
贾琏 听 了 ， 倒 在 炕上 ， 拍手 笑 道 ： “ 我 竟 不知 平儿 这么 利害 ， 从此 倒服 了 他 了 。 ”,"' Bravo ! Good for Patience ! ' said Jia Lian , who had retreated on to the kang and was applauding the comedy from that safer eminence . ' I did not know she had it in her . In future I shall take that girl more seriously . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 都 是 你 兴 的 他 ， 我 只 和 你 算账 就 完 了 。 ”,"' It is you who have let her get above herself , ' said Xi-feng . ' I hold you directly responsible for this ! '"
贾琏 听 了 啐 道 ： “ 你们 两个 人 不 睦 ， 又 拿 我 来 垫 喘儿 了 。 我 躲开 你们 就 完 了 。 ”,"' Oh no ! ' said Jia Lian . ' If you two want to quarrel , I am not going to stand between you and take all the knocks , I am getting out of here ! '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 我 看 你 躲到 那里 去 ！ ”,"' I am sure I do not know where you think you will go to , ' said Xi-feng ."
贾琏 道 ： “ 我 自然 有 去处 。 ” 说 着 就 走 ， 凤姐 道 ： “ 你 别 走 ， 我 还有 话 和 你 说 呢 。 ”,"' Do not you worry , I have got somewhere to go to , ' said Jia Lian , and he began to go ; but Xi-feng stopped him . ' No , do not go ! There is something else I want to talk to you about . '"
不知 何事 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,"But if you want to know what it was , you will have to wait for the next chapter ."
第二十二回,Chapter 22

制 灯谜 贾政 悲 谶语,And Jia Zheng sees portents of doom in lantern riddles
话 说 贾琏 听 凤姐儿 说 有 话 商量 ， 因 止步 问 ： “ 什么 话 ？ ”,"Hearing that Xi-feng wanted to consult him about something , Jia Lian halted and asked her what it was ."
凤姐 道 ： “ 二十一 是 薛妹妹 的 生日 ， 你 到底 怎么样 ？ ”,"' It is Bao-chai 's birthday on the twenty-first , ' said Xi-feng . ' What do you think we ought to do about it ? '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 我 知道 怎么样 ？,' How should I know ? ' said Jia Lian .
你 连 多少 大 生日 都 料理 过 了 ， 这 会子 倒 没有 主意 了 ！ ”,' You have managed plenty of big birthday celebrations before in your time . Why have you become so helpless all of a sudden ? '
凤姐 道 ： “ 大 生日 是 有 一定 的 则例 。 如今 他 这 生日 ， 大 又 不是 ， 小 又 不是 ： 所以 和 你 商量 。 ”,"' There are fixed rules for everything when you are planning a big grown-up celebration , ' said Xi-feng ; ' but in Bao-chai 's case she is neither exactly grown-up nor exactly a child any longer . That is why I wanted your advice . '"
贾琏 听 了 ， 低头 想 了 半日 ， 道 ： “ 你 竟 糊涂 了 ！ 现有 比例 。 那 林妹妹 就是 例 。,"Jia Lian lowered his head and thought for a moment . ' Why , you are being stupid ! ' he said presently . ' There is a precedent right in front of you . What about Dai-yu ?"
往年 怎么 给 林妹妹 做 的 ， 如今 也 照样 给 薛妹妹 做 就是 了 。 ”,All you have got to do is find what arrangements you made in the past for her and do exactly the same for Bao-chai now . '
凤姐 听 了 冷笑 道 ； “ 我 难道 这个 也 不 知道 ！ 我 也 这么 想来 着 。,' Do you suppose I did not think of that ? ' said Xi-feng with scorn . ' I am not that stupid !
但 昨日 听见 老太太 说 ， 问起 大家 的 年纪 生日 来 ， 听见 薛大妹妹 今年 十五岁 ， 虽 不算 是 整 生日 ， 也 算 得 将 笄 的 年 分儿 了 。 老太太 说 要 替 他 做生日 ， 自然 和 往年 给 林妹妹 做 的 不同 了 。 ”,"The point is that yesterday , because of something Grandma said , I started asking them all their birthdays and ages , and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the twenty-first Bao-chai is going to be fifteen . Now that does not qualify for a full-scale celebration , but it is a sort of coming-of-age , and when Grandma heard about it she said she wanted to sponsor something for it herself . So obviously , whatever we do , it can not be quite the same as what we have done in the past for Dai-yu . '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 这么着 ， 就 比 林妹妹 的 多 增 些 。 ”,"' Well in that case , ' said Jia Lian , ' take what you did for Dai-yu as a basis and just add on a bit . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 我 也 这么 想着 ， 所以 讨 你 的 口气 儿 。 我 私自 添 了 ， 你 又 怪 我 不 回 明白 了 你 了 。 ”,"' That is what I would thought of doing , ' said Xi-feng ; ' but I wanted to see what you thought before doing anything definite , because I did not want to go adding extras on my own initiative and then have you complaining that you had not been properly consulted . '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 罢 ， 罢 ！ 这 空头 情 我 不 领 ； 你 不 盘察 我 ， 就 够 了 。 我 还 怪 你 ？ ”,"' You can cut that out ! ' said Jia Lian - though not illhumouredly . ' You know you do not really mean a word of it ! Just stop snooping on me all the time , that is all I ask . You will not hear any complaints from me then about not being consulted ! '"
说 着 ， 一 径 去 了 ， 不在话下 。,"With that he walked off : but whither , or to whom , our narrative does not disclose ."
且说 湘云 住 了 两日 ， 便 要 回去 ， 贾母因 说 ： “ 等 过 了 你 宝姐姐 的 生日 ， 看 了 戏 ， 再 回去 。 ”,"It tells us instead that Shi Xiang-yun , having spent a considerable part of the New Year holiday with the Jias , was now on the point of returning home , but was urged by Grandmother Jia to wait for Bao-chai 's birthday and not go back until she had seen the plays ."
湘云 听 了 ， 只得 住 下 ， 又 一面 遣 人 回去 ， 将 自己 旧日 作 的 两件 针线活 计取 来 ， 为 宝钗 生辰 之 仪 。,Xiang-yun agreed to stay and sent someone home with instructions to tell them that she would be returning a little later than planned and to fetch a couple of pieces of her own embroidery that she could give to Bao-chai as a birthday-present .
谁 想 贾母 自见 宝钗 来 了 ， 喜 他 稳重 和平 ， 正值 他 才 过 第一个 生辰 ， 便 自己 捐资 二十两 ， 唤 了 凤姐 来 ， 交与 他 备 酒 戏 。,"Ever since Bao-chai 's first arrival , Grandmother Jia had been pleasurably impressed by her placid and dependable disposition , and now that she was about to spend her first "" big "" birthday in the Jia household , the old lady resolved to make it a memorable one . Taking twenty taels of silver from her private store , she summoned Xi-feng and directed her to spend it on providing wine and plays for a celebration ."
凤姐 凑趣 ， 笑 道 ： “ 一个 老祖宗 ， 给 孩子 们 作 生日 ， 不拘 怎么着 ， 谁 还 敢争 ？ 又 办 什么 酒席 呢 ？ 既 高兴 ， 要 热闹 ， 就 说不得 自己 花费 几两 老 库里 的 体 已 。 这 早晚 找出 这 霉烂 的 二十两 银子 来 做东 ， 意思 还 叫 我们 赔上 ！,"Xi-feng made this the occasion for a little raillery . ' If the old lady says she wants her grandchild 's birthday celebrated , ' she said , ' then celebrated it must be , and we must all jump to it without arguing ! But if she is going to start asking for plays as well , all I can say to that is that if she is in the mood for a bit of fun , I am afraid she is going to have to pay for it . She is going to have to cough up something out of those private savings of hers she is been hoarding all these years - not wait until the last minute and then fish out a measly little twenty taels to pay for the party : that is just another way of telling us we have got to pay for it ourselves ."
果然 拿 不 出来 ， 也罢 了 ； 金 的 、 银 的 、 圆 的 、 扁 的 ， 压塌 了 箱子 底 ， 只是 累 措 我们 ！,"I mean , if you were really hard up , it would be another matter : but you have got boxes and boxes of boodle - the bottoms are dropping out of them , they are so full ! It is pure meanness , that is what it is !"
老祖宗 看看 ， 谁 不是 你 老人家 的 儿女 ？ 难道 将来 只有 宝兄弟 顶 你 老人家 上 五台山 不成 ？,"You forget , Grannie , when you go to heaven young Bao-yu will not be the only one who will walk ahead of the hearse . You have got other grandchildren too , do not forget !"
那些 东西 只 留给 他 ！,You do not have to leave everything to him .
我们 虽 不配 使 ， 也别 太苦 了 我们 ， — — 这个 够 酒 的 够 戏 的 呢 ？ ”,"The rest of us may not be much use , but you must not be too hard on us . Twenty taels ! Do you really think that is enough to pay for a party and plays ? '"
说 的 满 屋里 都 笑 起来 。 贾母亦 笑 道 ： “ 你们 听听 这 嘴 ！ 我 也 算 会 说 的 了 ， 怎么 说 不过 这 猴儿 ？ — — 你 婆婆 也 不敢 强嘴 ， 你 就 和 我 ‘ 哪 ’ 啊 ‘ 哪 ’ 的 ！ ”,"At this point the entire company burst into laughter , which Grandmother Jia joined in herself . ' Just listen to her ! ' she said . ' I thought I had a fairly sharp tongue , but I am no match for this one : "" Clack-clack , clack-clack "" - it is worse than a pair of wooden clappers ! Even your mother-in-law daren ' t argue with me , my dear ! Do not pick on me ! '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 我 婆婆 也 是 一样 的 疼 宝玉 ， 我 也 没处 诉冤 ！ 倒 说 我 强嘴 ！ ”,"' Mother-in-law is just as soppy about Bao-yu as you are , ' said Xi-feng . ' I have got no one to tell my troubles to . And you say I am sharp-tongued ! '"
说 着 ， 又 引 贾母笑 了 一会 。,Xi-feng 's mock-lugubriousness set the old lady off in another squall of laughter .
贾母 十分 喜悦 。,"She loved to be teased , and Xi-feng 's bantering put her in great good humour ."
到 晚上 ， 众人 都 在 贾母 前 ， 定省 之 余 ， 大家 娘儿们 说 笑 时 ， 贾母因 问 宝钗爱 听 何 戏 ， 爱 吃 何物 。,"That night , when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own apartments , Grandmother Jia asked Bao-chai what sort of plays she liked hest and what her favourite dishes were ."
宝钗 深知 贾母 年老 之 人 ， 喜 热闹 戏文 ， 爱 吃 甜烂 之 物 ， 便 总 依 贾母素 喜者 说 了 一遍 。,"Bao-chai was well aware that her grandmother , like most old women , enjoyed the livelier , more rackety sort of plays and liked sweet and pappy things to eat , so she framed her answers entirely in terms of these preferences ."
贾母 更加 喜欢 。,The old lady was delighted .
次日 ， 先 送 过 衣服 玩物 去 ， 王夫人 、 凤姐 、 黛玉 等 诸人 皆 有 随分 的 ， 不须 细说 。,"Next day presents of clothing and various other objects , to which Lady Wang , Xi-feng , Dai-yu and the rest had all contributed , were sent round to Bao-chai 's . Our narrative supplies no details ."
至 二十一日 ， 贾母 内院 搭 了 家常 小巧 戏台 ， 定 了 一班 新出 的 小戏 ， 昆弋 两腔 俱 有 。,At last the twenty-first arrived . A dear little stage had been erected in the courtyard outside Grandmother Jia 's apartment and a newly trained troupe of child actors able to perform both Kun-qu and the noisier Yi-qiang type of plays had been engaged .
就 在 贾母 上房 摆 了 几席 家宴 酒席 ， 并 无 一个 外客 ， 只有 薛姨妈 、 史湘云 、 宝钗 是 客 ， 余者 皆 是 自己 人 。,"In the apartment 's main sitting-room a semicircle of little tables were arranged facing outwards towards the stage and laid in preparation for a feast . No outsiders were invited . The guests of honour were Aunt Xue , Shi Xiang-yun and Bao-chai herself , All the others invited were members of the family"
这日 早起 ， 宝玉 因 不见 黛玉 ， 便 到 他 房中 来 寻 。,"Early that morning Bao-yu , not seeing Dai-yu around , went to look for her in her room and found her still reclining on the kang ."
只见 黛玉 歪 在 炕上 ， 宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 起来 吃饭 去 。,' Get up and have something to eat ! ' he said .
— — 就 开戏 了 ， 你 爱 听 那 一出 ？ 我 好点 。 ”,' The players will be starting shortly . Tell me some play you like so that I shall know which one to choose ! '
黛玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 你 既 这么 说 ， 你 就 特 叫 一班 戏 ， 拣 我 爱 的 唱 给 我 听 ， 这 会子 犯不上 借着 光儿 问 我 。 ”,"' If you are so anxious to please me , ' said Dai-yu coldly , ' you ought to hire a troupe specially and put on all my favourites . It is a cheap sort of kindness to treat me at someone else 's expense ! '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 这 有 什么 难 的 ， 明儿 就 叫 一 班子 ， 也 叫 他们 借着 咱们 的 光儿 。 ”,"' Never mind ! ' said Bao-yu . When we hire a troupe for you , you will be able to return the compliment . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 拉 他 起来 ， 携手 出去 。,"He hauled her up from the kang , and the two of them went offhand in hand together ."
吃了饭 ， 点戏 时 ， 贾母 一面 先 叫 宝钗 点 ， 宝钗 推让 一遍 ， 无法 ， 只得 点 了 一出 《 西游记 》 。,"As soon as they had eaten , it was time to talk about choosing the plays and Grandmother Jia called on Bao-chai to begin . Bao-chai made a show of declining ; but it was her birthday , and in the end she gave in and selected a piece about Monkey from The Journey to the West ."
贾母 自是 喜欢 。,Grandmother Jia was pleased .
又 让 薛姨妈 ， 薛姨妈 见 宝钗 点 了 ， 不肯 再点 。,"Aunt Xue was now invited to pick a play , but as her own daughter had just chosen , she refused ."
贾母 便 特命 凤姐 点 。,Grandmother Jia did not press her and passed on to Xi-feng .
凤姐 虽有 邢王二 夫人 在 前 ， 但 因 贾母 之 命 ， 不敢 违拗 ； 且 知 贾母喜 热闹 ， 更 喜 谑 笑 科浑 ， 便 先 点 了 一出 ， 却是 《 刘二 当 衣 》 。,"Xi-feng would normally have refused to take precedence over her aunt and mother-in-law , who were both present , but Grandmother had commanded and must be obeyed . As she happened to know that the old lady 's partiality for lively plays was particularly strong in the case of those which had lots of jokes and clowning in them , she selected a piece entitled Liu Er Pawns His Clothes in order to make sure that this element was not lacking from the programme ."
贾母 果真 更 又 喜欢 。,"As she had anticipated , Grandmother Jia was even more delighted by this second choice ."
然后 便命 黛玉 点 ， 黛玉 又 让 王夫人 等 先点 。,Next Dai-yu was asked to choose . She deferred to Aunt Xing and Aunt Wang ; but Grandmother Jia was insistent :
贾母 道 ： “ 今儿 原 是 我 特 带 着 你们 取乐 ， 咱们 只管 咱们 的 ， 别理 他们 。,"' I have brought you young people here today for some fun , she said . I want you to enjoy yourselves . Never mind about them !"
我 巴巴儿 的 唱戏 摆酒 ， 为 他们 呢 ？,I did not go to all this trouble just for their sakes !
他们 白 听戏 ， 白吃 ， 已经 便宜 了 ， 还 让 他们 点戏 呢 ！ ”,"They are lucky to be here at all , having all this good food and entertainment for nothing : you surely do not think that on top of that I am going to let them choose the plays ? '"
说 着 ， 大家 都 笑 。 黛玉 方点 了 一出 。,"The others all laughed , and Dai-yu chose a play ."
然后 宝玉 、 史湘云 、 迎 、 探 、 惜 、 李 纨等俱各点 了 ， 按 出 扮演 。,"Then Bao-yu , Shi Xiang-yun , Ying-chun , Tan-chun , Xi-chun and Li Wan each chose a play in turn , after which the little players proceeded to perform them in the order in which they had been selected ."
至上 酒席 时 ， 贾母 又 命 宝钗 点 ， 宝钗 点 了 一出 《 山门 》 。,"When the time came to bring in the wine and begin the feast , Grandmother Jia invited Bao-chai to choose again . This time she asked for Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 只好 点 这些 戏 。 ”,' Why do you keep choosing plays like that ? ' said Bao-yu .
宝钗 道 ： “ 你 白 听 了 这 几年 戏 ， 那里 知道 这 出戏 — — 排场 词藻 都 好 呢 。 ”,"' To hear you talk , it does not sound as if all your years of play-going have taught you much , ' said Bao-chai . ' This is an excellent play , both from the point of view of the music and of the words ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 从来 怕 这些 热闹 戏 。 ”,"' I can not stand noisy plays , ' said Bao-yu . ' I never could . '"
宝钗笑 道 ： “ 要说 这 一出 ‘ 热闹 ’ ， 你 更 不知 戏 了 ！,"' If you call this a noisy play , ' said Bao-chai , ' it proves that you do not know what you are talking about ."
你 过来 ， 我 告诉 你 ， 这 一出戏 是 一套 ‘ 北点 绛 唇 ’ ， 铿锵 顿挫 ， 那 音律 不用说 是 好 了 ； 那 词藻 中 ， 有 只 ‘ 寄生 草 ’ ， 极妙 ， 你 何曾 知道 ！ ”,"Come over here and I will explain . This Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate is a "" Ruby Lips "" sequence in the Northern mode . That means , musically speaking , that it is in a vigorous , somewhat staccato style . In fact the musical excellence of this piece goes without saying . But apart from that , the libretto is good , too . The words of Zhi-shen 's "" Clinging Vine "" aria , which is the last but one in the sequence , are particularly fine . '"
宝玉 见 说 的 这般 好 ， 便 凑近 来 央告 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 念 给 我 听听 。 ”,"Bao-yu was interested , drew his chair closer , and begged her to let him hear them ."
宝钗 便 念 给 他 听道 ：,"Lowering her voice so as not to disturb the others , she half-sang , half-recited them for his benefit :"
漫 揾 英雄 泪 ， 相离 处士 家 。,' I dash aside the manly tear And take leave of my monkish home .
谢 慈悲 ， 剃度 在 莲台 下 。,"A word of thanks to you , my Master dear ; Who tonsured me before the Lotus Throne :"
没 缘法 ， 转眼 分离 乍 。,"' Twas not my luck to stay with you , And in a short while I must say adieu ."
赤条条 ， 来 去 无 牵挂 。,Naked and friendless through the world to roam .
那里 讨 ， 烟蓑雨笠 卷 单行 ？,"I ask no goods , no gear to take away ,"
一任 俺 ， 芒鞋 破 钵 随缘 化 ！,"Only straw sandals and a broken borwl , To beg from place to place as best I may . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 喜 的 拍膝 摇头 ， 称赏不已 — — 又 赞 宝钗 无 书 不知 。,"Bao-yu listened enthralled tapping his knee and nodding his head in time to her singing . When she had done , he agreed enthusiastically about the excellence of the words and congratulated her on the extraordinary breadth of her knowledge ."
黛玉 把 嘴 一撇 道 ： “ 安静 些 看戏 吧 ！ 还 没唱 《 山门 》 ， 你 就 《 妆 疯 》 了 。 ”,"' Sh ! ' said Dai-yu , looking round crossly in Bao-yu 's direction . ' Can not you be a bit quieter and attend to the play ? This is Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate we are supposed to be listening to , not Jing-de Acts the Madman ! '"
说 的 湘云 也 笑 了 。,Xiang-yun found this very funny .
于是 大家 看戏 ， 到 晚方 散 。,They continued to watch plays until the evening .
贾母 深爱 那 做 小旦 的 和 那 做 小丑 的 ， 因 命人 带进来 ， 细看 时 ， 益发 可怜见 的 。 因 问 他 年纪 ： 那 小旦 才 十一岁 ， 小丑 才 九岁 ； 大家 叹息 了 一回 。 贾母 令人 另 拿 些 肉果 给 他 两个 ， 又 另 赏钱 。,"Grandmother Jia had taken a particular fancy to the little player who had acted the heroine 's parts and the one who had played the clown , and when the last performance was over , she asked for them to be brought in to see her . She found them very ' sweet ' - even more so on a closer inspection - and asked them their ages . The leading lady turned out to be eleven and the clown only nine . There were murmurs and exclamations from all present when they heard this , and Grandmother Jia told someone to give them delicacies from the table and a present of money each , in addition to what they would receive as members of the troupe ."
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 这个 孩子 扮上 活象 一个 人 ， 你们 再 瞧 不 出来 。 ”,"Meanwhile Xi-feng appeared to be very much amused about something . The way that child there is made-up makes him look so like someone we know , ' she said . ' Haven ' t any of you noticed ? '"
宝钗心 内 也 知道 ， 却 点头 不 说 ； 宝玉 也 点 了 点头 儿 不敢 说 。,"Bao-chai knew whom she was referring to , but merely nodded her head slightly without replying . Bao-yu , too , nodded , but did not dare to reply ."
湘云 便 接口 道 ： “ 我 知道 ， 是 象 林姐姐 的 模样儿 。 ”,"Only Xiang-yun was tactless enough to say anything : ' Oh , I know ! ' she blurted out . ' Like Cousin Lin , you mean ? '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 忙 把 湘云 瞅 了 一眼 。,Bao-yu shot a quick glance in her direction ; but it was too late .
众人 听 了 这话 ， 留神 细看 ， 都 笑 起来 了 ， 说 ： “ 果然 象 他 ！ ”,"Xiang-yun 's reply had prompted the others to look more carefully , with the result that they all instantaneously burst out laughing , so striking was the resemblance ."
一时 散 了 。,Shortly after this the party broke up .
晚间 ， 湘云 便命 翠缕 把 衣包 收拾 了 ， 翠缕 道 ： “ 忙 什么 ？ 等去 的 时候 包 也 不迟 。 ”,During the evening Xiang-yun ordered Kingfisher to start packing . Kingfisher remonstrated : ' What is the hurry ? Why not wait till we are going ? There will be plenty of time before we go . '
湘云 道 ： “ 明 早就 走 ， 还 在 这里 做 什么 ？,"' We are going first thing tomorrow , ' said Xiang-yun . ' What is the point of staying any longer ?"
— — 看 人家 的 脸子 ！ ”,You can see from the looks on their faces that we are not welcome here . '
宝玉 听 了 这话 ， 忙 近前 说道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 你 错怪 了 我 。,"Bao-yu chanced to overhear this remark and hurried in to her : ' You are wrong to be offended with me , coz ."
林妹妹 是 个 多心 的 人 。 别人 分明 知道 ， 不肯 说 出来 ， 也 皆 因怕 他 恼 。,"The others all know how sensitive Cousin Lin is , and they would not answer because they were afraid of upsetting her ."
谁知 你 不 防头 就 说 出来 了 ， 他 岂 不恼 呢 ？,"When you suddenly spoke up without realizing , I knew she was bound to be upset , and that is the reason why I looked at you like that ."
我 怕 你 得罪 了 人 ， 所以 才 使眼色 。,"I was worried for your sake , because I was afraid she would be offended with you ."
你 这 会子 恼 了 我 ， 岂 不 辜负 了 我 ？,That you should now get angry with me is really rather unfair .
要是 别人 ， 那 怕 他 得罪 了 人 ， 与我何干 呢 ？ ”,"If it had been anyone else but you , I should not have minded whether they offended her or not . I should not have felt that much concern about them . '"
湘云 摔 手道 ： “ 你 那 花言巧语 ， 别 望 着 我 说 。,Xiang-yun silenced him with an imperious wave of her hand : ' You can save your fine speeches for someone else . They are wasted on me .
我 原 不及 你 林妹妹 。,Obviously I am not in the same class as your Cousin Lin .
别人 拿 他 取笑 儿 都 使得 ， 我 说 了 就 有 不是 。,"It is all right for other people to laugh at her ; but as soon as I say anything about her , I am at once in the wrong . I am not really worthy to speak about her at all ."
我 本 也 不配 和 他 说话 ： 他 是 主子 姑娘 ， 我 是 奴才 丫头 么 ！ ”,She is the young lady of the house . I am only a little nobody ! '
宝玉 急 的 说道 ： “ 我 倒 是 为 你 为 出 不是 来 了 。,"' I was only thinking of you , said Bao-yu in great agitation , yet now you put me in the wrong ."
我 要 有 坏心 ， 立刻 化成灰 ， 教 万 人 拿 脚 踹 ！ ”,May I straightway turn into dust and be trodden beneath ten thousand feet if I had any but the kindest intentions ! '
湘云 道 ： “ 大 正月 里 ， 少 信 着 嘴 胡说 这些 没 要紧 的 歪话 ！,"' You are too glib with your ridiculous oaths , ' said Xiang-yun . ' This is no time for swearing ."
你 要说 ， 你 说 给 那些 小性儿 、 行动 爱 恼人 、 会 辖治 你 的 人 听 去 ！,"You can keep that kind of talk for that sensitive , easily upset person you were talking about . She knows how to handle you ."
别 叫 我 啐 你 。 ”,Do not try it on me : it makes me thick ! '
说 着 ， 进 贾母 里间 屋里 ， 气 忿忿 的 躺 着 去 了 。,With these words she walked off into the inner room of Grandmother Jia 's apartment and lay down on the kang in a rage .
宝玉 没趣 ， 只得 又 来 找 黛玉 。,"Very much out of countenance , Bao-yu went off to look for Dai-yu ."
谁知 才 进门 ， 便 被 黛玉 推出 来 了 ， 将门 关上 。,"She must have been waiting for him , for just as he was entering the room , she pushed him out again and shut the door ."
宝玉 又 不解 何故 ， 在 窗外 只是 低声 叫 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 好 妹妹 ！ ”,"Totally at a loss to understand her behaviour , he called to her softly through the window : ' Dai , dear ! Dai ! '"
黛玉总 不理 他 。,But she took no notice .
宝玉 闷闷 的 垂头 不语 。,"Bao-yu stood there disconsolately , hanging his head in silence ."
紫鹃 却 知 端底 ， 当 此时 ， 料 不能 劝 。 那宝玉 只 呆呆 的 站 着 。 黛玉 只当 他 回去 了 ， 却 开了门 ， 只见 宝玉 还 站 在 那里 。 黛玉 不好 再 闭门 ， 宝玉 因 跟 进来 ， 问道 ： “ 凡事 都 有 个 原故 ， 说 出来 人 也 不 委屈 。 好好 的 就 恼 ， 到底 为什么 起 呢 ？ ”,"Nightingale knew what was happening , but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene ; so he continued to stand there like an idiot , until at last Dai-yu thought he must have gone back to his own room , and opened the door again . When she saw him still standing there , she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time , and allowed him to follow her back into the room . ' There is always a reason for everything , ' he said . ' If you tell people what it is , they do not feel so bad about it . You can not suddenly get angry with me for no reason whatever . What is all this about ? '"
黛玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 问 我 呢 ！ 我 也 不知 为什么 。 我 原是 给 你们 取笑 儿 的 ， — — 拿 着 我 比 戏子 ， 给 众人 取笑 儿 ！ ”,' Do not ask me ! ' said Dai-yu coldly . ' I do not know . I am only a figure of fun - the sort of person you might compare with a child actor in order to get a good laugh from the others . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 并 没有 比 你 ， 也 并 没有 笑 你 ， 为什么 恼 我 呢 ？ ”,"' I never made the comparison , ' said Bao-yu hotly , and I never laughed at you . Why should you be angry with me ? '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 还要 比 ！ 你 还要 笑 ！ 你 不 比不 笑 ， 比 人家 比 了 笑 了 的 还 利害 呢 ！ ”,"' You would like to have made the comparison ; you would like to have laughed , ' said Dai-yu . ' To me your way of not comparing and not laughing was worse than the others ' laughing and comparing ! '"
宝玉 听说 ， 无可 分辩 。,Bao-yu found this unanswerable .
黛玉 又 道 ： “ 这 还 可恕 。,"' However , ' Dai-yu went on , ' that I could forgive ."
你 为什么 又 和云儿 使眼色 儿 ？,But what about that look you gave Yun ?
这 安 的 是 什么 心 ？,Just what did you mean by that ? I think I know what you meant .
莫不是 他 和 我 玩 ， 他 就 自轻自贱 了 ？,You meant to warn her that she would cheapen herself by joking with me as an equal .
他 是 公侯 的 小姐 ， 我 原是 民间 的 丫头 。 他 和 我 玩 ， 设如 我 回 了 口 ， 那 不是 他自 惹 轻贱 ？,"Because she is an Honourable and her uncle 's a marquis and I am only the daughter of a commoner , she must not risk joking with me , because it would be so degrading for her if I were to answer back ."
— — 你 是 这个 主意 不是 ？,"That is what you meant , is not it ?"
你 却 也 是 好心 ， 只是 那 一个 不领 你 的 情 ， 一般 也 恼 了 。,"Oh yes , you had the kindest intentions . Only unfortunately she did not want your kind intentions and got angry with you in spite of them ."
你 又 拿 我 作情 ， 倒 说 我 ‘ 小性儿 、 行动 肯 恼人 ’ 。,"So you tried to make it up with her at my expense , by telling her how touchy I am and how easily I get upset ."
你 又 怕 他 得罪 了 我 ， — — 我 恼 他 与你何干 ， 他 得罪 了 我 又 与你何干 呢 ？ ”,"You were afraid she might offend me , were you ? As if it were any business of yours whether she offended me or not , or whether or not I got angry with her ! '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 方知 才 和 湘云 私 谈 ， 他 也 听见 了 。,"When Bao-yu heard her say this , he knew she must have overheard every word of his conversation with Xiang-yun ."
细 想 自己 原为 怕 他 二人 恼 了 ， 故 在 中间 调停 ， 不料 自己 反落 了 两处 的 数落 ， 正合 着 前日 所 看 《 南华 经 》 内 ： “ 巧者 劳而 智者 忧 ， 无能者 无 所求 ， 蔬食 而 遨游 ， 泛若不系之舟 。 ”,He reflected that he had only acted in the first place from a desire to keep the peace between them : yet the only outcome of his good intentions had been a telling-off by either party .
又 曰 “ 山木自寇 ， 源泉 自 盗 ” 等 句 ， 因此 越 想 越 无趣 ；,"It put him in mind of something he had read a day or two previously in Zhuang-xi : The cunning waste their pains ; The wise men ver their brains ; Bul the simpleton , who seeks no gains , With belly full , he wanders free As drifting boat upon the sea . and of another passage from the same book about timber trees inviting the axe and sweet springs being the cause of their own contamination . The more he thought about it , the more dejected he became ."
再 细 想来 ： “ 如今 不过 这 几个 人 ， 尚 不能 应酬 妥协 ， 将来 犹欲 何为 ？ … … ”,"' If I can not even get on with the few people I live with now , ' he asked himself , ' how am I going to manage later on . . . ? '"
想到 其间 ， 也 不 分辩 ， 自己 转身 回房 。,"At that point in his reflections it seemed to him that there was no further point in arguing , and he turned to go back to his room ."
黛玉 见 他 去 了 ， 便 知回 思 无趣 ， 赌气 去 的 ， 一言 也 不 发 ， 不禁 自己 越 添 了 气 ， 便 说 ： “ 这一 去 ， 一辈子 也别 来 了 ， — — 也别 说话 ！ ”,"Dai-yu realized that he must have thought of something upsetting to go off like this . But not to be answered was altogether too provoking . She felt the anger mounting inside her . ' All right , go ! ' she shouted after him . And do not ever come back ! And do not ever speak to me again ! '"
那宝玉 不理 ， 竟 回来 ， 躺 在 床上 ， 只是 闷闷 的 。,"Bao-yu ignored her . He went straight back to his own room , threw himself on the bed , and lay staring at the ceiling ."
袭 人 虽 深知 原委 ， 不敢 就 说 ， 只得 以 别事 来 解说 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 今儿 听 了 戏 ， 又 勾出 几天 戏 来 。 宝 姑娘 一定 要 还席 的 。 ”,"Aroma knew what the trouble was but dared not , for the time being at any rate , refer to it . She tried distracting him with talk of other matters . ' I suppose there will be more plays after today , will not there ? Miss Bao is sure to give a return party , is not she ? '"
宝玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 他 还 不 还 ， 与 我 什么 相干 ？ ”,"' Whether she does or not , ' said Bao-yu , ' what concern is it of mine ? '"
袭 人 见 这话 不 似 往日 ， 因 又 笑 道 ： “ 这 是 怎么 说 呢 ？,"This was certainly not the sort of answer Aroma was used to getting . She tried again , smiling breezily : ' That is no way of looking at it !"
好好儿 的 大 正月 里 ， 娘儿们 姐儿们 都 喜 喜欢 欢 的 ， 你 又 怎么 这个 样儿 了 ？ ”,"This is the New Year holidays , when their ladyships and the young ladies are all enjoying themselves . We can not have you mooning around like this ! '"
宝玉 冷笑 道 ： “ 他们 娘儿们 姐儿们 喜欢 不 喜欢 ， 也 与 我 无 干 。 ”,"' Whether their ladyships and the young ladies are enjoying themselves or not , ' said Bao-yu , ' what concern is it of mine ? '"
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 他们 既 随和 ， 你 也 随和 ， 岂 不 大家 彼此 有趣 。 ”,"Aroma laughed . ' Seeing that they are all doing their best to be agreeable , could not you try to do likewise ? Surely it is much better all round if everyone will give and take a bit ? '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 什么 ‘ 大家 彼此 ’ ？,"' What do you mean , "" give and take a bit "" ? ' said Bao-yu in the same lack-lustre voice as before ."
— — 他们 有 ‘ 大家 彼此 ’ ， 我 只是 赤条条 无 牵挂 的 ！ ”,' They can give and take a bit if they like . My destiny is a different one : naked and friendless through the world to roam . '
说 到 这 句 ， 不觉 泪 下 。,A tear stole down his cheek as he recalled the line from the aria .
［ 袭 人 见 这 景况 ， 不敢 再说 。 ］,
宝玉 细想 这 一句 意味 ， 不禁 大哭 起来 。,"He continued to ponder its words and to savour their meaning , and ended up by bursting into tears and crying outright ."
翻身 站 起来 ， 至 案边 ， 提笔 立 占 一 偈 云 ：,"Jumping up from the bed , he went over to his desk , took up a writing-brush , and wrote down the following lines in imitation of a Buddhist gāthā :"
你 证 我 证 ， 心证意 证 。,"I swear , you swear ; With heart and mind declare ;"
是 无有 证 ， 斯可云 证 。,But our protest Is no true test It would be best Words unexpressed
无可 云证 ， 是 立足 境 。,To understand And on that ground To take our stand .
写毕 ， 自己 虽 解悟 ， 又 恐 人 看 了 不解 ， 因 又 填 一只 “ 寄生 草 ” ， 写 在 偈 后 。,"After writing it , he was still not satisfied . Though now enlightened himself , he feared that someone reading his gatha might not be able to share his enlightenment . Accordingly , with the words of the Clinging Vine ' aria still running in his head , he added another set of verses after it to explain his point ."
又 念 了 一遍 ， 自觉 心中 无有 挂碍 ， 便 上床 睡 了 。,"That done , he read the whole through to himself out loud , then , with a wonderful feeling of liberation , went to bed and fell fast asleep ."
谁知 黛 玉见宝玉 此番 果断 而 去 ， 假以 寻袭 人为 由 ， 来看 动静 。,"Curious to know the sequel to Bao-yu 's departure , Dai-yu , on the pretext of wanting to see Aroma about something , eventually came round herself to have a look ."
袭 人 回道 ： “ 已经 睡 了 。 ”,Aroma told her that Bao-yu was already in bed asleep .
黛玉 听 了 ， 就 欲 回去 ， 袭 人 笑 道 ：,She was on the point of going back again when Aroma smilingly detained her :
“ 姑娘 请 站 着 ， 有 一个 字帖儿 ， 瞧瞧 写 的 是 什么 话 。 ”,"' Just a moment , Miss ! There is a note here . Would you like to see what it says ? '"
便 将 宝玉 方才 所写 的 拿给 黛玉 看 。,She handed her the sheet of paper containing Bao-yu 's gāthā and the ' Clinging Vine ' poem .
黛玉 看 了 ， 知是 宝玉 为 一时 感忿而作 ， 不觉 又 可笑 又 可叹 。,Dai-yu could see that they must have been written under the influence of their recent quarrel and could not help feeling both amused by them and a little sorry .
便 向袭 人道 ： “ 作 的 是 个 玩意儿 ， 无 甚 关系 的 。 ”,But all she said to Aroma was : ' It is only a joke . Nothing of any consequence . '
〈 说 毕 ， 便携 了 回房 去 ， 与 湘云 同 看 。,She took it with her back to her own room and showed it to Xiang-yun .
次日 ， 又 与 宝钗 看 。 〉,Next day she showed it to Bao-chai as well .
宝钗 念 其 词曰 ：,Bao-chai glanced at the second poem . This is what Bao-yu had written :
无 我 原非 你 ， 从 他 不解 伊 。,"You would have been at fault , if not for me ; But why should I care if they disagree ?"
肆行 无碍 凭 来 去 。,"Free come , free go , let nothing bar or hold me !"
茫茫 着 甚 悲愁 喜 ？,"No more I will sink and soar between gloom and elation ,"
纷纷 说 甚 亲 疏密 ？,Or endlessly debate the depth of our elation .
从前 碌碌 却 因 何 ？,What was the point of all of that past pother ?
到 如今 ， 回头 试想 真 无趣 ！,"When I look back on it , it seems scarce worth the bother ."
看毕 ， 又 看 那 偈语 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 这 是 我 的 不是 了 。,Then she read the gāthā . She laughed . ' I am afraid this is all my fault .
我 昨儿 一支 曲子 ， 把 他 这个 话 惹出来 。,It must have been that aria I told him about yesterday which started it all .
这些 道 书 机锋 ， 最 能 移性 的 ， 明儿 认真 说起 这些 疯话 ， 存 了 这个 念头 ， 岂不是 从 我 这 支 曲子 起 的 呢 ， 我 成 了 个 罪魁 了 ！ ”,Those Taoist writings and Zen paradoxes can so easily lead people astray if they do not understand them properly . I shall never forgive myself if he is going to start taking this sort of nonsense seriously and getting it fixed in his head . It will all be because of that aria ! '
说 着 ， 便 撕 了 个 粉碎 ， 递给 丫头 们 ， 叫 ： “ 快 烧 了 。 ”,"She tore the paper into tiny pieces and gave them to one of the maids : Here , burn this - straight away !"
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 不该 撕 了 ， 等 我 问 他 ， 你们 跟我来 ， 包管 叫 他 收 了 这个 痴心 。 ”,"Dai-yu laughed at her . ' You need not have torn it up . If you will both come with me and wait while I put a question to him , I can guarantee to drive this nonsense from his mind once and for all . '"
三 人 说 着 ， 过来 见 了 宝玉 。,The three girls went round to Bao-yu 's room together .
黛玉 先 笑 道 ： “ 宝玉 ， 我 问 你 ： 至 贵者 ‘ 宝 ’ ， 至 坚者 ‘ 玉 ’ 。 尔 有何 贵 ？ 尔 有何 坚 ？ ”,"' Bao-yu , ' said Dai-yu , addressing him in a heavily mock-serious manner , ' I wish to propound a question to you : "" Bao "" is that which is of all things the most precious and "" yu "" is that which is of all things the most hard . Wherein lies your preciousness and wherein lies your hardness ? '"
宝玉 竟 不能 答 。,Bao-yu was unable to think of an answer .
二人 笑 道 ： “ 这样 愚钝 ， 还 参禅 呢 ！ ” 湘云 也 拍手 笑 道 ： “ 宝 哥哥 可输 了 ！ ”,"The girls all laughed and clapped their hands . ' Ha , ha , ha ! He can not reply . For a student of Zen he does seem remarkably obtuse ! '"
黛玉 又 道 ： “ 你 道 ‘ 无可 云证 ， 是 立足 境 ’ ， 固然 好 了 ， 只是 据 我 看来 ， 还 未 尽善 。,"' You say in your gāthā , ' Dai-yu continued , ' "" It would be best Words unerpressed To understand , And on that ground To take our stand . "" Now that is all right as far as it goes , but it does not go far enough ."
我 还续 两句 云 ： ‘ 无 立足 境 ， 方是 干净 。 ’ ”,"I should like to add a few lines to it . Like this : But , I perpend , To have no ground On which to stand Were yet more sound . And there is an end ! '"
宝钗 道 ： “ 实在 这方 悟彻 。,"' Ah , that is better ! ' said Bao-chai . ' That sounds like a real "" insight "" ."
当日 南宗 六祖 惠能初 寻师 至 韶州 ， 闻五祖 宏忍 在 黄梅 ， 他 便 充作 火头 僧 。,"When the Sixth Patriarch Hui-neng first came to Shao-zhou looking for a teacher , he heard that the Fifth Patriarch Hong-ren was living at the monastery on Yellow-plum Mountain , so he found employment there in the monastery kitchen ."
五祖 欲求 法嗣 ， 令 诸僧 各 出 一 偈 ， 上 座 神秀 说道 ：,"When the Fifth Patriarch wanted to choose a successor , he ordered each of the monks to compose a gatha . The Elder Shen-xiu recited this one :"
‘ 身 是 菩提树 ，,"' Our body like the Bo-tree is ,"
心 如 明镜 台 ：,Our minds a mirror bright .
时时 勤 拂拭 ，,"Then keep it clean and free from dust ,"
莫 使 有 尘埃 。 ’,So it reflects the light ! '
惠能 在 厨房 舂 米 ， 听 了 道 ： ‘ 美则 美 矣 ， 了 则 未了 。 ’,"Hui-neng happened to be hulling rice in the kitchen at the time , and he shouted out , ' That is not bad , but it is still not quite right . '"
因 自念 一 偈 日 ：,Then he recited this gāthā of his own :
‘ 菩提 本 非 树 ，,"' No real Bo-tree the body is ,"
明镜 亦非台 。,The mind no mirror bright .
本来 无一物 ，,"Since of the pair none 's really there ,"
何处 染 尘埃 ？ ’,On what could dust alight ? '
五祖 便 将 衣钵 传给 了 他 。,The Fifth Patriarch at once handed him his robe and bowl as a sign that he was to succeed him .
今儿 这 偈语 亦 同此意 了 。,"Your improvement on Cousin Bao 's gāthā is on very much the same lines , Dai ."
只是 方才 这 句 机锋 ， 尚未 完全 了结 ， 这 便 丢开 手 不成 ？ ”,"There is just one thing , though : what about that "" koan "" of yours he could not answer ? Surely you are not going to let him get away with it ? '"
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 他 不能 答 就算 输 了 ， 这 会子 答上 了 也 不为 出奇 了 。,"' Failure to answer means defeat , ' said Dai-yu . ' In any case , if he were to answer now , it would hardly count ."
只是 以后 再 不许 谈禅 了 。,The only condition I impose as victor is that he should henceforth be forbidden to talk any more about Zen .
— — 连 我们 两个 人 所知 所能 的 ， 你 还 不知 不能 呢 ， 还 去 参 什么 禅 呢 ！ ”,"You see , ' she told Bao-yu , ' even Bao-chai and I know more about it than you do . It is too ridiculous that you should set yourself up as a Zen authority ! '"
宝玉 自己 以为 觉悟 ， 不想 忽 被 黛玉 一 问 ， 便 不能 答 ； 宝钗 又 比出 “ 语录 ” 来 ： 此 皆 素 不见 他们 所能 的 。,Bao-yu had in fact believed that he had attained an Enlightenment ; but now suddenly here was Dai-yu propounding koans he could not answer and Bao-chai quoting with easy familiarity from the Saying of the Patriarchs - though neither had shown any evidence of these accomplishments in the past . It was clear that their understanding of these matters was far in advance of his own .
自己 想 了 一 想 ： “ 原来 他们 比 我 的 知觉 在 先 ， 尚未 解悟 ， 我 如今 何必 自寻 苦恼 。 ”,"He consoled himself with the reflection that if they , whose understanding was so superior , were manifestly still so far from Enlightenment , it was obviously a waste of time for him to go on pursuing it ."
想毕 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 谁 又 参禅 ， 不过 是 一时 的 玩 话儿 罢了 。 ”,"Having reached this comfortable conclusion , he accepted Dai-yu 's condition with a laugh : ' Who wants to be an authority on Zen ? It was only a joke , any way ! '"
［ 说 罢 ， 四 人 仍复 如 旧 。 ］,
忽然 人报 娘娘 差人 送出 一个 灯谜 来 ， 命 他们 大家 去 猜 ， 猜 后 每人 也 作 一个 送进去 。,"Just then it was announced that the Imperial Concubine had sent someone round from the Palace with a lantern-riddle which they were to try and guess . After they had guessed the answer , they were each to make up a riddle of their own and send it back to her ."
四 人 听说 ， 忙 出来 至 贾母 上房 ， 只见 一个 小太监 ， 拿 了 一盏 四角 平头 白 纱灯 ， 专 为 灯谜 而 制 ， 上面 已有 了 一个 ， 众人 都 争看 乱猜 。 小太监 又 下谕 道 ： “ 众 小姐 猜 着 ， 不要 说 出来 ， 每人 只 暗暗 的 写 了 ， 一齐 封 送进去 ， 候 娘娘 自验 是否 。 ”,"As soon as they heard this , the four of them hurried to the reception room in Grandmother Jia 's apartment , where they found a young eunuch with a square , flat-topped lantern of white gauze specially made for hanging riddles on . There was one hanging on it already which they crowded round to read while the eunuch gave them their instructions : ' When the young ladies have guessed , will they please not tell anyone the answer , but write it down secretly . The answers will be collected and taken back to the Palace in a sealed envelope so that Her Grace can see for herself who has guessed correctly . '"
宝钗 听 了 ， 近前 一 看 ， 是 一首 七言绝句 ， 并 无 新奇 ， 口中 少不得 称赞 ， 只 说 ： “ 难 猜 。 ” 故意 寻思 ， 其实 一见早 猜着 了 。,"Bao-chai went up to the lantern and looked at the riddle , which was in the form of a quatrain . It was not a particularly ingenious one , but she felt obliged to praise it , and therefore remarked that it was ' hard to guess ' and pretended to have to think about the answer , though in truth it had been obvious to her at a glance ."
宝玉 、 黛玉 、 湘云 、 探春 四个 人 也 都 解 了 ， 各自 暗暗 的 写 了 。,"Bao-yu , Dai-yu , Xiang-yun and Tan-chun had also guessed the answer and were busy writing it down ."
一并 将 贾环 、 贾兰 等 传来 ， 一齐 各 揣 心机 猜 了 ， 写 在 纸 上 ， 然后 各人 拈 一物 作成 一 谜 ， 恭 楷 写 了 ， 挂于 灯 上 。,"Presently Jia Huan and Jia Lan were summoned , and they too wrote something down after a good deal of puzzling . After that everyone made up a riddle about some object of their choice , wrote it out in the best kai-shu on a slip of paper , and hung it on the lantern , which was then taken away by the eunuch ."
太监 去 了 ， 至 晚 出来 ， 传谕 道 ： “ 前日 娘娘 所制 ， 俱 已 猜 着 ， 惟二 小姐 与 三爷 猜 的 不是 。,Towards evening the eunuch returned and reported what the Imperial Concubine had had to say about the results : ' Her Grace 's own riddle was correctly guessed by everyone except Miss Ying and Master Huan .
小姐 们 作 的 也 都 猜 了 ， 不知 是否 ？ ”,"Her Grace has thought of answers to all the riddles sent her by the young ladies and gentlemen , but she does not know whether or not they are correct . '"
说 着 ， 也 将 写 的 拿 出来 ， 也 有 猜 着 的 ， 也 有 猜不着 的 。 〈 都 胡乱 说 猜 着 了 。 〉,"He showed them the answers written down . Some were right and some were wrong , but even those whose riddles had been incorrectly answered deemed it prudent to pretend that the answers they had received were the right ones ."
太监 又 将 颁赐 之物 ， 送与 猜 着 之人 ： 每人 一个 宫制 诗筒 ， 一 柄 茶 筅 。,The eunuch proceeded to distribute prizes for answering the Imperial Concubine 's riddle . Everyone who had guessed correctly received an ivory note-case made by Palace craftsmen and a bamboo tea-whisk .
独 迎春 、 贾环 二人 未 得 。,Ying-chun and Jia Huan were the only ones who did not receive anything .
迎春 自 以为 玩笑 小事 ， 并 不介意 。 贾环便 觉得 没趣 。,"Ying-chun treated the matter as a joke and rapidly dismissed it from her mind , but Jia Huan was very much put out ."
且 又 听 太监 说 ： “ 三爷 所 作 这个 不通 ， 娘娘 也 没 猜 ， 叫 我 带回 问 三爷 是 个 什么 。 ”,"To make matters worse , the eunuch went on to query Jia Huan 's own riddle : ' Her Grace says that she has not answered Master Huan 's riddle because she could not make any sense of it . She told me to bring it back and ask him what it means . '"
众人 听 了 ， 都 来看 他 作 的 是 什么 ， — — 写道 ：,"Intrigued , the others crowded round to look . This is what Jia Huan had written :"
大哥 有 角 只 八个 ， 二哥 有 角 只 两根 。,' Big brother with eight sits all day on the bed ;
大哥 只 在 床上 坐 ， 二哥 爱 在 房上 蹲 。,Little brother with two sits on the roof 's head . ' .
众人 看 了 ， 大发 一 笑 。,There was a loud laugh when they had finished reading it .
贾环 只得 告诉 太监 说 ： “ 是 一个 枕头 ， 一个 兽头 。 ”,Jia Huan told the eunuch the answer : a head-rest and a ridge-end .
太监 记 了 ， 领茶 而 去 。,"The eunuch made a note of it and , after taking tea , departed once more ."
贾母 见 元春 这般 有兴 ， 自己 一发 喜乐 ， 便 命速 作 一架 小巧 精致 围屏 灯来 ， 设 于 堂屋 ， 命 他 姊妹 们 各自 暗暗 的 做 了 ， 写 出来 ， 粘 在 屏 上 ， 然后 预备 下 香茶 细果 ， 以及 各色 玩物 ， 为 猜着 之 贺 。,"Fired with enthusiasm by Yuan-chun 's example , old Lady Jia decided to hold a riddle party . A very elegant lantern in the form of a three-leaved screen was hurriedly constructed on her orders and set up in the hall . When that had been done , she told all the boys and girls to make up a riddle - being careful to keep the answers to themselves - write it on a slip of paper , and stick it on her lantern-screen . Then , having prepared the best fragrant tea to drink , a variety of good things to eat , and lots of little gifts to serve as prizes , she was ready to begin ."
贾政朝 罢 ， 见 贾母 高兴 ， 况 在 节间 ， 晚上 也 来 承欢 取乐 。,Jia Zheng observed the old lady 's excitement when he got back from Court and came along himself in the evening to join in the fun .
上面 贾母 、 贾政 、 宝玉 一席 ， 王夫人 、 宝钗 、 黛玉 、 湘云 又 一席 ， 迎春 、 探春 、 惜春 三 人 又 一席 ， 俱 在 下面 。,"There were three tables . Grandmother Jia , Jia Zheng and Bao-yu sat at the table on the kang , while below , Lady Wang , Bao-chai , Dai-yu and Xiang-yun sat at one table and Ying-chun , Tan-chun and Xi-chun at another ."
地下 老婆 丫鬟 站 满 。,The floor below the kang was thronged with old women and maids in attendance .
李宫裁 王熙凤 二人 在 里间 又 一席 。,Li Wan and Xi-feng had a table to themselves in an inner room .
贾政因 不见 贾兰 ， 便 问 ： “ 怎么 不见 兰哥儿 ？ ”,"' Where is my little Lan ? ' said Jia Zheng , not seeing Jia Lan at any of the tables ."
地下 女 人们 忙 进 里间 问 李氏 ， 李氏 起身 笑 着 回道 ： “ 他 说 方才 老爷 并 没 叫 他 去 ， 他 不肯 来 。 ”,One of the serving-women went into the inner room to ask Li Wan . She rose to reply out of respect for her father-in-law : ' He refuses to come because he says his Grandpa Zheng hasn ' t invited him . '
女 人们 回复 了 贾政 ， 众人 都 笑 说 ： “ 天生 的 牛心 拐 孤 ！ ”,The others were much amused when the woman relayed this answer back to Jia Zheng . ' He is a stubborn little chap when he is made his mind up ! ' they said . But they thought none the worse of him for that .
贾政忙 遣 贾环 和 ＜ 两 ＞ 个 女人 将 贾兰唤 来 ， 贾母命 他 在 身边 坐 了 ， 抓 果子 给 他 吃 ， 大家 说 笑 取乐 。,"Jia Zheng quickly sent Jia Huan with two of the old women to fetch him . When he arrived , Grandmother Jia made him squeeze up beside her on her side of the table and gave him a handful of nuts and dried fruits to eat . The little boy 's presence provided the company with something to laugh and talk about ."
往常 间 只有 宝玉 长谈阔论 ， 今日 贾政 在 这里 ， 便 唯唯 而已 。,"But not for long . Bao-yu , who normally did most of the talking on occasions like this , was today reduced by his father 's presence to saying no more than yes ' and ' no ' to remarks made by other people ."
余者 ， 湘云 虽 系 闺阁 弱质 ， 却素喜 谈论 ， 今日 贾政 在 席 ， 也 自 拑 口 禁 语 ； 黛玉 本性 娇懒 ， 不肯 多 话 ； 宝钗原 不 妄言 轻动 ， 便 此时 亦 是 坦然自若 ： 故此 一席 ， 虽 是 家常 取乐 ， 反见 拘束 。,"As for the rest : Xiang-yun , in spite of her sheltered upbringing , was normally an animated , not to say indefatigable talker , but this evening she too seemed to have been afficted with dumbness by Jia Zheng 's presence ; Dai-yu was at the best of times unwilling to say very much in company from a sort of aristocratic lethargy which was a part of her nature ; and Bao-chai , whose punctilious correctness made her always sparing in the use of words , even though on this occasion she was probably the least uncomfortable of those present , said little to advance the conversation . As a consequence , what should have been a jolly , intimate family party was painfully unnatural and restrained ."
贾母亦 知因 贾政 一 人 在 此 所致 ， 酒过三巡 ， 便 撵 贾政 去 歇息 。,"Grandmother Jia knew as well as everyone else that this state of affairs was entirely owing to Jia Zheng 's presence , and after the wine had gone round for the third time , she attempted to drive him off to bed ."
贾政亦 知 贾母 之 意 ， 撵 了 他 去 好 让 他 姊妹 兄弟 们 取乐 ， — — 因 陪笑 道 ： “ 今日 原 听见 老太太 这里 大 设 春 灯 雅 谜 ， 故 也 备 了 彩礼 酒席 ， 特 来 入会 ， 何 疼 孙子 孙女 之 心 ， 便 不略 赐与 儿子 半点 ？ ”,"Jia Zheng , for his part , was perfectly well aware that he was being driven away so that the younger people could feel freer to enjoy themselves and , smiling forcedly , appealed against his banishment : ' When they told me earlier today that you were planning to give a riddle party , I specially prepared a contribution to the feast so that I might come and join you . You have so much affection for your grandchildren , Mama . Can you not spare just a tiny bit for your Son ? '"
贾母笑 道 ： “ 你 在 这里 ， 他们 都 不敢 说 笑 ， 没 的 倒 叫 我 闷 的 慌 。,Grandmother Jia laughed : ' They can not talk naturally while you are here . All you are doing is making it gloomy for me . I can not abide it .
你 要 猜谜儿 ， 我 说 一个 你 猜 ， 猜不着 是 要罚 的 。 ”,"Well , if you have come to answer riddles , I will give you a riddle . But if you can not guess the answer , you will have to pay me a forfeit . '"
贾政忙 笑 道 ： “ 自然 受罚 。,"' Yes , of course , ' said Jia Zheng eagerly ."
— — 若 猜着 了 ， 也 要 领赏 呢 ！ ”,"' And if I guess right , I shall expect to be given a prize . '"
贾母 道 ： “ 这个 自然 。 ”,"' Of course , ' said Grandmother Jia ."
便 念道 ：,
猴子 身轻站 树梢 。,' The monkey 's tail reaches from tree-top to ground .
— — 打 一 果名 。,It is the name of a fruit . '
贾政 已知 是 荔枝 ， 故意 乱猜 ， 罚 了 许多 东西 ， 然后 方 猜 着 了 ， 也 得 了 贾母 的 东西 ， 然后 也 念 一个 灯谜 与 贾母 猜 。,"Jia Zheng knew that the answer to this hoary old chestnut was a longan ' ( long ' un ) , but pretended not to , and made all kinds of absurd guesses , each time incurring the obligation to pay his mother a forfeit , before finally giving the right answer and receiving the old lady 's prize . Then he propounded a riddle of his own for her :"
念道 ：,
身 自 端方 ，,' My body 's square
体自 坚硬 。,Iron-hard am I
虽 不能 言 ，,"I speak no word ,"
有 言 必应 。,But words supply
— — 打一用物 。,- It is a useful object . '
说 毕 ， 便 悄悄的 说 与 宝玉 ， 宝玉 会意 ， 又 悄悄的 告诉 了 贾母 。,"He whispered the answer to Bao-yu , who , readily understanding what was expected of him , surreptitiously passed it on to Grandmother Jia ."
贾母 想 了 一 想 ， 果然 不 差 ， 便 说 ： “ 是 砚台 。 ”,"The old lady , having thought for a bit and decided that it sounded all right , said : ' An inkstone . '"
贾政笑 道 ： “ 到底 是 老太太 ， 一 猜 就是 。 ” 回头 说 ： “ 快 把 贺彩 献上 来 。 ”,"' Bravo , Mamma ! Right first time ! ' said Jia Zheng , and turning round to address the servants , he asked them to bring in the presents for Lady Jia ."
地下 妇女 答应 一声 ， 大盘 小盒 ， 一齐 捧 上 。,"There was an answering call from the women below , and presently a number of them came forward bearing trays and boxes of various shapes and sizes which they handed up onto the kang ."
贾母 逐件 看 去 ， 都 是 灯节 下 所用 所 玩 新巧 之物 ， 心中 甚 喜 ， 遂 命 ： “ 给 你 老爷 斟酒 。 ”,"Grandmother Jia examined them one by one . They all contained traditional Lantern Festival presents , but in new and exquisite designs and of the very highest quality . The old lady was obviously pleased . ' Come , children ! ' she commanded jovially . ' Give the Master a drink ! '"
宝玉 执壶 ， 迎春 送酒 。,Bao-yu stood up and poured wine from the wine-kettle into a little cup and Ying-chun handed it ceremoniously to her uncle .
贾母因 说 ： “ 你 瞧瞧 那 屏 上 ， 都 是 他 姐儿们 做 的 ， 再 猜 一 猜 我 听 。 ”,"' Have a look at the riddles on the screen , ' said Grandmother Jia when Jia Zheng , with equal ceremony , had drained the cup . ' They were all made up by the children . See if you can tell me the answers . '"
贾政 答应 ， 起身 走 至 屏 前 ， 只见 第一个 是 元妃 的 ， 写 着 道 ：,Jia Zheng rose from his seat and went up to the lantern-screen . The first riddle he saw was Yuan-chun 's :
能 使 妖魔 胆尽摧 ，,At my coming the devils turn pallid with wonder .
身 如束 帛气 如雷 。,My body 's all folds and my voice is like thunder .
一声 震得 人方 恐 ，,"When , alarmed by the sound of my thunderous crash ,"
回 首相 看 已化 灰 。,"You look round , I have already turned into ash ."
— — 打 一 玩物 。,An object of amusement .
贾政道 ： “ 这 是 爆竹 吗 ？ ”,' Would that be a firework ? ' said Jia Zheng .
宝玉 答道 ： “ 是 。 ”,"' Yes , ' said Bao-yu"
贾政又 看 迎春 的 ， 道 ：,"Jia Zheng looked again , this time at Ying-chun 's :"
天运 人 功理 不 穷 ，,Mans works and heaven 's laws I execute .
有功 无运 也 难逢 。,"Without heaven 's laws , my workings bear no fruit ."
因 何镇 日 纷纷 乱 ？,Why am I agitated all day long ?
只 为 阴阳 数 不通 。,For fear my calculations may be wrong .
— — 打一用物 。,A useful object
贾政道 ： “ 是 算盘 ？ ”,' An abacus ? '
迎春 笑 道 ： “ 是 。 ”,There was a laugh from Ying-chun : ' Yes . '
又 往 下 看 ， 是 探春 的 ， 道 ：,The next riddle was Tan-chun 's :
阶下 儿童 仰面 时 ，,In spring the little boys lookup and stare
清明 妆点 最 堪宜 。,To see me ride so proudly in the air .
游丝 一断 浑 无力 ，,"My strength all goes when once the bond is parted ,"
莫向 东风 怨 别离 。,And on the wind I drift off broken-hearted .
— — 打 一 玩物 。,An object of amusement .
贾政道 ： “ 好象 风筝 。 ”,"' It looks as if that ought to be a kite , ' said Jia Zheng ."
探春 道 ： “ 是 。 ”,"' Yes , ' said Tan-chun"
贾政 再往 下看 ， 是 黛玉 的 ， 道 ：,The next riddle he looked at was Dai-yu 's :
朝 罢 谁 携 两袖 烟 ？,At court levee my smoke is in your sleeve :
琴 边 衾 里 两 无缘 。,Music and beds to other sorts I leave .
晓筹 不用 鸡人 报 ，,"With me , at dawn you need no watchman 's cry ,"
五夜 无烦 侍女 添 。,At night no maid to bring afresh supply .
焦首朝朝 还 暮 暮 ，,"My head burns through the night and through the day ,"
煎心 日日 复年 年 。,And year by year my heart consumes away .
光阴荏苒 须 当惜 ，,The precious moments I would have you spare :
风雨 阴晴 任 变迁 。,"But come fair , foul , or fine , I do not care ."
— — 打一用物 。,A useful object
贾政道 ： “ 这个 莫非 是 更 香 ？ ”,' That must be an incense-clock .
宝玉 代言 道 ：,Bao-yu answered for her :
“ 是 。 ”,' Yes . '
贾政又 看道 ：,Jia Zheng looked at the next riddle :
南面 而 坐 ，,Southward you stare
北面 而朝 ，,He will northward glare
“ 象忧 亦 忧 ，,"Grieve , and he is sad ."
象 喜 亦 喜 。 ”,"Laugh , and he is glad ."
— — 打一用物 。,A useful object
贾政道 ： “ 好 ， 好 ！,' Very good ! ' said Jia Zheng .
如 猜 镜子 ， 妙极 ！ ”,"' If the answer is "" a mirror "" , it is a very good riddle . '"
宝玉 笑 回道 ： “ 是 。 ”,Bao-yu laughed : ' That is the answer . '
贾政道 ： “ 这 一个 却 无 名字 ， 是 谁 做 的 ？ ”,' Who is it by ? ' said Jia Zheng . ' There is no name on it . '
贾母 道 ： “ 这个 大约 是 宝玉 做 的 ？ ”,"' I expect that one is by Bao-yu , ' said Grandmother Jia ."
贾政 就 不 言语 。,Jia Zheng said nothing and passed on to the next one in silence .
往下 再 看 宝钗 的 ， 道 是 ：,It was by Bao-chai :
有眼无珠 腹内 空 ，,My ' eyes ' can not see and I am hollow inside .
荷花 出水 喜相逢 。,"When the lotuses surface , I will be by your side ."
梧桐叶 落 分离 别 ，,"When the autumn leaves fall I shall bid you adieu ,"
恩爱夫妻 不到 冬 。,For our marriage must end when the summer is through .
— — 打一用物 。,A useful object
贾政 看完 ， 心 内 自忖 道 ： “ 此物 还 倒 有限 ， 只是 小小年纪 ， 作 此等 言语 ， 更觉 不祥 。,"Jia Zheng knew that the answer must be ' a bamboo wife ' , as they call those wickerwork cylinders which are put between the bedclothes in summertime to make them cooler ; but a growing awareness that all the girls ' verses contained images of grief and loss was by now so much affecting him that he felt quite unable to go on ."
看来 皆 非 福寿之 辈 。 ”,' Enough is enough ! ' he thought . ' What can it be that makes these innocent young creatures all produce language that is so tragic and inauspicious ? It is almost as if they were all destined to be unfortunate and short-lived and were unconsciously foretelling their destiny . '
想到 此处 ， 甚觉 烦闷 ， 大 有 悲戚 之 状 ， 只是 垂头 沉思 。,The gloom into which this reflection plunged him was evident in the melancholy expression on his face and in his bowed and dejected stance .
贾母 见 贾政 如此 光景 ， 想到 他 身体 劳乏 ， 又 恐 拘束 了 他 众 姊妹 ， 不得 高兴 玩耍 ， 便 对 贾政道 ： “ 你 竟 不必 在 这里 了 ， 歇 着 去 罢 ！,"Grandmother Jia noticed it but attributed it to fatigue . She feared that in this melancholy mood his continued presence would place an even greater restraint on the young folk 's gaiety . ' I think you really ought not to stay , ' she said . ' Why do not you go and lie down ?"
让 我们 再 坐 一会 子 ， 也 就 散 了 。 ”,"The rest of us will sit up for a bit , but I do not expect we shall go on very much longer . '"
贾政 一闻 此言 ， 连忙 答应 几个 “ 是 。 ”,"' Yes , ' said Jia Zheng , roused from his reverie by her voice . ' Yes , of course . '"
又 勉强 劝 了 贾母 一回 酒 ， 方才 退出 去 了 。,But he forced himself to resume his former jovial manner and to drink another cup or two of wine with her before finally retiring .
回至 房中 ， 只是 思索 ， 翻来复去 ， 甚觉 凄 惋 。,"Back in his own apartment , he became lost in reverie once more ; but whichever direction his thoughts took him in , he remained melancholy and troubled ."
这里 贾母 见 贾政 去 了 ， 便 道 ： “ 你们 乐一乐 罢 — — ”,"Meanwhile the party he had just left was proceeding somewhat differently . ' Now , my dears , you can enjoy yourselves ! '"
一 语 未了 ， 只见 宝玉 跑 至 围屏 灯前 ， 指手画脚 ， 信口 批评 ： “ 这个 这 一句 不好 。 ” “ 那个 破 的 不 恰当 。 ” 如同 开 了 锁 的 猴儿 一般 。,Grandmother Jia said as soon as he had left the room ; and the words were no sooner out of her mouth than Bao-yu leaped up from his seat and over to the screen and began criticizing the riddles on it - this one had a line wrong here - that one 's words did not suit the subject - pointing with his finger and capering about for all the world like a captive monkey that had just been let off its chain .
黛玉 便道 ： “ 还象 方才 大家 坐 着 ， 说说笑笑 ， 岂 不 斯文 些 儿 ？ ”,"' Can not we sit down and enjoy ourselves quietly , as we were doing just now , ' said Dai-yu , ' instead of all this prancing about ? '"
凤姐儿 自 里间 屋里 出来 ， 插口 说道 ： “ 你 这个 人 ， 就 该 老爷 每日 合 你 寸步 儿 不 离 才 好 。,"Xi-feng put in a word too , emerging from the inner room to say it : ' You ought to have Uncle Zheng with you every day and never budge an inch from his side ! '"
刚才 我 忘 了 ， 为什么 不 当着 老爷 ， 撺掇 着 叫 你 作 诗谜 儿 ？,She turned to the others : ' What a pity I did not think of it at the time : we ought to have got Uncle to make him compose some more riddles for us .
这 会子 不怕 你 不 出汗 呢 ！ ”,Then we should have seen him sweat ! '
说 的 宝玉 急 了 ， 扯 着 凤姐儿 厮缠 了 一会 。,"Bao-yu was greatly exasperated by this remark and tried to seize hold of her . Xi-feng tried to ward him off , and the result was that the two of them became locked in a sort of playful wrestling-match ."
贾母 又 和 李宫裁 并 众 姊妹 等 说 笑 了 一会 子 ， 也 觉 有些 困倦 ， 听 了 听 ， 已 交 四 鼓 了 ， 因命 将 食物 撤 去 ， 赏给 众人 ， 遂 起身 道 ： “ 我们 歇 着 罢 。 明日 还是 节 呢 ， 该当 早些 起来 。 明日 晚上 再 玩 罢 。 ”,"Grandmother Jia continued for a while to laugh and joke with Li Wan and the girls , but soon began to feel tired and sleepy . The night-drum was sounding , and when they stopped to listen they found it was already the beginning of the fourth watch . She ordered the food to be cleared away , telling the servants that they might have what was left over for themselves . ' Time for bed , children ! ' she said , rising to her feet . We can do this again tomorrow , if you like ; but now we must have some sleep . '"
于是 众人 方慢慢 的 散去 。,With that the party gradually broke up and they all dispersed to their rooms .
未知 次日 如何 ， 且 听 下回分解 。,What happened thereafter will be told in the following chapter .
第二十三回,Chapter 23
西厢记 妙词通 戏语,Words from the ' Western Chamber ' supply a joke that offends
牡丹亭 艳 曲警芳 心,And songs from the ' Soul 's Return ' move a tender heart to anguish
话 说 贾母 次日 仍 领 众人 过节 。,
那元妃 却 自幸 大观园 回宫 去后 ， 便命 将 那日 所有 的 题咏 ， 命 探春 抄录 妥协 ， 自己 编次 优劣 ， 又 令 在 大观园 勒石 ， 为 千古 风流 雅事 。,"Some time after her return from the Visitation the Imperial Concubine commissioned Tan-chun to make her a copy of all the poems about Prospect Garden that had been written during her visit , and having rearranged them in what she considered to be their order of merit , further instructed that they should be engraved on stone in the Prospect Garden itself - a lasting memorial to the precocious talent of her gifted family ."
因此 贾政命 人 选拔 精工 ， 大观园 磨石 镌 字 。 贾珍 率领 贾蓉 贾 蔷等 监工 。,"In pursuance of these instructions , Jia Zheng ordered his people to look out the best craftsmen available to prepare and engrave the stone and delegated Cousin Zhen to supervise the work with Jia Rong and Jia Qiang as his lieutenants ."
因 贾蔷又 管 着 文官 等 十二个 女 戏子 并行 头等 事 ， 不得 空闲 ， 因此 又 将 贾 菖 、 贾菱 、 贾萍 唤 来 监工 。,"As Jia Qiang proved to be fully occupied with his twelve young actresses - not to mention their costumes , properties and other paraphernalia - three other junior members of the clan , Jia Chang , Jia Ling and Jia Ping , were called in to supervise the labour in his stead ."
一日 烫蜡 钉 朱 ， 动起 手来 。,"In due course the preliminary stages of waxing , scratching and ' redding in ' had commenced , and work on the memorial proceeded according to plan ."
这 也 不在话下 。,We pass from this to other matters .
且说 那 玉皇庙 并 达摩 庵 两处 ， 一班 的 十二个 小沙弥 并 十二个 小道士 ， 如今 挪出 大观园 来 ， 贾政正 想 发到 各 庙 去 分住 。,"The twenty-four little Buddhist and Taoist nuns having now been moved out of the two miniature temples in the garden , Jia Zheng had been thinking of dispersing them among various temples and convents about the city , when a certain Zhou-shi , the widow of a poor relation of the Rong-guo Jias who lived near by in North Dukes Street , chanced to get wind of this matter and saw in it the possibility of some employment ."
不想 后 街上 住 的 贾芹 之 母 〈 周氏 〉 ， 正 打算 到 贾政 这边 谋 一个 大小 事件 与 儿子 管管 ， 也好 弄 些 银钱 使用 ， 可巧 听见 这件 事 ， 便 坐车来 求 凤姐 。,"Zhou-shi had for some time past been meaning to ask Jia Zheng if he would find her boy Jia Qin a job - no matter how small a job as long as it would bring them in a little income - and now , hearing this news about the nuns , she drove incontinent forth to Xi-feng as fast as cab could carry her and besought her to use her influence on the boy 's behalf ."
凤姐 因见 他 素日 〈 不大 拿班作势 的 〉 ， 便 依允 了 。,"Xi-feng had always found Zhou-shi a pleasant , unassuming sort of body and was disposed to help her ."
想 了 几句话 ， 便 回 了 王夫人 说 ： “ 这些 小 和尚 小道士 万 不可 打发 到 别处 去 ， 一时 娘娘 出来 ， 就要 应承 的 。 倘或 散 了 ， 若 再 用 时 ， 可 又 费事 。,"Having agreed to do so , and having rehearsed her line of approach , she went in to Lady Wang and broached the matter with her in the following manner . ' These little Buddhist and Taoist nuns , ' she said , ' - we definitely ought not to send them away . We shall need them again if Her Grace ever comes on another visit , and it will be a terrible job getting them together again if they have all been dispersed ."
依 我 的 主意 ， 不如 将 他们 都 送到 家庙 铁槛 寺 去 ， 月间 不过 派 一个 人 拿 几两 银子 去 买 柴米 就是 了 。 说声用 ， 走 去 叫 一声 就 来 ， 一点儿 不 费事 。 ”,"If you ask me , the best thing would be to move them to the Temple of the Iron Threshold where they would still be under our control . It would only be a question of sending someone out there every month with a bit of money to pay for their housekeeping ; then if there is ever any question of needing them again , we have only to say the word and they can be with us immediately without any trouble . '"
王夫人 听 了 ， 便商 之 于 贾政 。,The suggestion pleased Jia Zheng when it was in due course relayed to him by Lady Wang .
贾政听 了 笑 道 ： “ 倒 是 提醒 了 我 。 就是 这样 。 ”,' Of course . That is just what we should do . I am glad you reminded me . '
即时 唤 贾琏 。 贾琏正 同 凤姐 吃饭 ， 一 闻 呼唤 ， 放下 饭 便 走 。 凤姐 一把 拉 住 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你 先 站住 ， 听 我 说话 ： 要是 别的 事 ， 我 不管 ， 要是 为 小 和尚 小道士 们 的 事 ， 好歹 你 依 着 我 这么着 。 ” 如此这般 ， 教 了 一套 话 ， 贾琏 摇头 笑 道 ： “ 我 不管 ！ 你 有 本事 你 说 去 。 ”,"From Jia Zheng a summons arrived for Jia Lian while he and Xi-feng were at dinner . He laid down his chopsticks and rose to go , but Xi-feng put a hand out and detained him : ' Not so fast ! Listen to me ! If it is anything else , never mind ; but if it is about those little nuns . ' - and she went on to tell him exactly what he should say in that event and to impress on him how important it was that he should say it . Jia Lian smiled and shook his head : ' Sorry , nothing doing ! You will have to ask him yourself - if you think you know how to ! '"
凤姐 听说 ， 把头 一 梗 ， 把 筷子 一 放 ， 腮 上 带 笑不笑 的 瞅 着 贾琏 道 ： “ 你 是 真话 ， 还是 玩 话儿 ？ ”,"Xi-feng 's back stiffened . She laid down her chopsticks and looked at Jia Lian . There was a glint in her eye and a dangerous little smile on her face when she spoke : ' Do you mean that , or are you joking ? '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 西廊 下 五 嫂子 的 儿子 芸儿 求 了 我 两三 遭 ， 要件 事 管管 ， 我 应 了 ， 叫 他 等 着 。,"' That boy of my cousin 's widow who lives in West Lane , Jia Yun , has been on at me two or three times about getting him a job , and I promised to do something for him if he would wait ."
好容易 出来 这件 事 ， 你 又 夺 了 去 ！ ”,"Now here at last a job comes along and , as usual , you want to snap it up yourself . '"
凤姐儿 笑 道 ： “ 你 放心 。 园子 东北角 上 ， 娘娘 说 了 ， 还 叫 多多 的 种松 柏树 ， 楼底下 还 叫 种 些 花草 儿 ， 等 这件 事 出来 ， 我 包管 叫 芸儿 管 这 工程 就是 了 。 ”,"' Do not worry ! ' said Xi-feng consolingly . ' Her Grace has mentioned that she wants a lot of planting done - pines and cypresses - in the north-east section of the garden , and she has also asked for more shrubs and flowers to be planted round the foot of the main hall . I promise you that as soon as that job comes up your Jia Yun shall be placed in charge of it . '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 这 也罢 了 。 ” 因 又 悄悄的 笑 道 ： “ 我 问 你 ， 我 昨儿 晚上 不过 要 改 个 样儿 ， 你 为什么 就 那么 扭手扭脚 的 呢 ？ ”,"' Oh well , in that case all right , ' said Jia Lian . ' Just one thing , though ' - he dropped his voice and smiled at her slily - ' Why did you keep pushing me off like that last night ? I only wanted to try a change of position . '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 把 脸 飞红 ， “ 嗤 ” 的 一 笑 ， 向 贾琏 啐 了 一口 ， 依旧 低下头 吃饭 。,"A quick flush overspread Xi-feng 's face and she exploded in a little laugh . Then with a ' pshaw ! ' in his direction , she lowered her head again and went back to her meal ."
贾琏 笑 着 一径 去 了 。,Jia Lian laughed and slipped away .
走 到 前面 ， 见 了 贾政 ， 果然 为 小 和尚 的 事 ， 贾琏便 依着 凤姐 的话 ， 说道 ： “ 看来 芹儿 倒 出息 了 ， 这件 事 ， 竟 交给 他 去 管 ， 横竖 照 里头 的 规例 ， 每月 支领 就是 了 。 ”,"On entering Jia Zheng 's presence he found that the subject was , as Xi-feng had anticipated , the arrangements for accommodating the little nuns , and he replied as Xi-feng had instructed him : ' Jia Qin is a promising young fellow . I think he could be entrusted with the job . In any case , he would be drawing the allowance from Accounts each month when all the other payments are made , so we should be able to keep an eye on him . '"
贾政原 不大 理论 这些 小事 ， 听 贾琏 如此 说 ， 便 依允 了 。,Jia Zheng never took much interest in these trivial domestic matters and agreed readily enough to Jia Lian 's suggestion .
贾琏 回房 告诉 凤姐 ， 凤姐 即 命 人 去 告诉 周氏 ， 贾芹 便 来 见 贾琏 夫妻 ， 感谢 不尽 。,The latter returned to his apartment and reported to Xi-feng . Xi-feng sent someone to inform Zhou-shi ; and soon Jia Qin himself had arrived and was pouring out his gratitude to the two benefactors .
凤姐 又 做 情 先 支 三个 月 的 费用 ， 叫 他 写 了 领字 ， 贾琏 画 了 押 ， 登时 发 了 对牌 出去 ， 银库 上 按 数 发出 三个 月 的 供给 来 ， — — 白花花 三百两 。 贾芹 随手 拈 了 一块 与 掌平 的 人 ， 叫 他们 “ 喝 了 茶 罢 ” 。,"With a show of conferring further favours , Xi-feng ' begged ' Jia Lian to allow Jia Qin three months ' payment in advance . A receipt was written for this amount and Jia Lian 's seal affixed to it , and there and then Jia Qin was issued with a tally and sent to the counting-house to collect the money . When the three hundred taels of shining silver had been weighed and counted and handed over , Jia Qin picked up a piece at random and tossed it to the cashiers to ' buy themselves a cup of tea with ' ."
于是 命 小厮 拿 了 回家 ， 与 母亲 商议 。 登时 雇车 坐 上 ， 又 雇 了 几辆车 子 ， 至 荣国府 角 门前 ， 唤出 二十四个 人 来 ， 坐 上 车子 ， 一 径往 城外 铁槛 寺 去 了 。,"He had a boy to carry the money back home for him , and after taking counsel with his mother he hired a stout little donkey for himself to ride on and four or five covered mule-carts for the nuns , and conducting the carts round to the side gate of the Rong-guo mansion , he called forth the twenty-four little nuns and packed them all inside . Then off they set , with Jia Qin on his donkey at the head of the procession , to the Temple of the Iron Threshold outside the city ."
当下 无 话 。,And there we leave them .
如今 且说 那元妃 在 宫中 编次 《 大观园 题咏 》 ， 忽然 想起 那 园中 的 景致 ， 自从 幸过 之后 ， 贾政 必定 敬谨 封锁 ， 不 叫 人 进去 ， 岂 不 辜负 此 园 ？ 况 家中 现有 几个 能诗会 赋 的 姊妹 们 ， 何不 命 他们 进去 居住 ， 也 不 使 佳人 落魄 ， 花柳 无颜 。,"Yuan-chun 's editing of the Prospect Garden poems had given her a vivid recollection of the garden 's beauties . She was sure that her father , out of a zealous reverence for the Emperor and herself , would have kept it all locked and closed since her visit and would have allowed no one else to enter , and she felt this to be a waste and a shame - the more so when her family contained so many poetical young ladies who would have found inspiration in its scenery - not to mention the benefit their presence would have bestowed on the garden itself for , as is well-known , When lovely woman smiles not , All Nature 's charms ate dead . Assuredly , the girls must be allowed into the garden . It should become their home ."
却 又 想 宝玉 自幼 在 姊妹 丛中 长大 ， 不 比 别的 兄弟 ， 若不命 他 进去 ， 又 怕 冷落 了 他 ， 恐 贾母王 夫人 心上 不 喜 ， 须 得 也 命 他 进去 居住 方妥 。,"And if the girls , why not Bao-yu ? He had grown up in their midst . He was different from other boys . If he were not allowed into the garden as well , he would consider himself left out in the cold , and his distress would cause Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia to feel unhappy too . Unquestionably she should ask for him to be admitted along with the girls ."
命 太监 ｛ 夏秉忠 ｝ 到 荣府 下 一道 谕 ： “ 命 宝钗 等 在 园中 居住 ， 不可 封 锢 ； 命 宝玉 也 随 进去 读书 。 ”,"Having reached this decision , she summoned the eunuch Xia Bing-zhong and ordered him to convey the following Edict to Rong-guo House : Bao-chai and the other young ladies of the household are to reside in the Garden . The Garden is not to be kept closed . Bao-yu is to accompany the young ladies into the Garden and to continue his studies there ."
贾政王 夫人 接 了 谕命 ， ｛ 夏秉忠 ｝ 去后 ， 便 回 明贾母 ， 遣 人 进去 各处 收拾 打扫 ， 安设 帘幔 床帐 。,"The Edict was received by Jia Zheng and Lady Wang . When Xia Bing-zhong had gone , they reported it at once to Grandmother Jia and sent servants into the garden to sweep and prepare its buildings and rehang the blinds , portières and bed-curtains in readiness for occupation ."
别人 听 了 ， 还 犹自 可 ， 惟 宝玉 喜之 不胜 。,No one was mote excited by the prospect of this move than Bao-yu .
正 和 贾母 盘算 ， 要 这个 ， 要 那个 ， 忽 见 丫鬟 来说 ： “ 老爷 叫 宝玉 。 ”,He was discussing it animatedly with Grandmother Jia ( it was a discussion in which the words ' I want ' recurred rather frequently ) when suddenly a maid came in and announced that he was wanted by his father .
〈 宝玉 听 了 ， 好似 打 个 焦雷 ， 登时 扫去 兴头 ， 〉 脸上 转 了 色 ， 便 拉 着 贾母 ， 扭 的 扭股 儿糖 似的 ， 死 也 不敢 去 。,"At this bolt from the blue his countenance fell and all his animation drained away . Clinging to his grandmother with the gluey persistence of a toffee twist , he made it abundantly plain to her that he had no wish to obey ."
贾母 只得 安慰 他 道 ： “ 好 宝贝 ， 你 只管 去 ， 有 我 呢 。 他 不敢 委屈 了 你 。,"The old lady did her best to comfort him : ' There , there , my lamb ! You would better go and see him . Grannie will see to it that he does not hurt you . He would not dare ."
况 你 做 了 这 篇 好 文章 ， 想必 娘娘 叫 你 进 园 去 住 ， 他 吩咐 你 几句话 ， 不过 是 怕 你 在 里头 淘气 。,"Besides , look at all those lovely poems you wrote : I expect that is why Her Grace is letting you inside the garden . I am sure that is all he wants to see you about . Probably he just wants to warn you against getting up to mischief after you have moved in ."
他 说 什么 ， 你 只 好生 答应 着 就是 了 。 ”,You only have to answer nicely and promise to do as he says . You will be all right . '
一面 安慰 ， 一面 唤 了 两个 老嬷嬷 来 ， 吩咐 ： “ 好生 带 了 宝玉 去 ， 别 叫 他 老子 唬 着 他 。 ” 老嬷嬷 答应 了 。,"To make sure , she sent a couple of old nannies along as well with strict instructions to watch over him : ' See that his Pa does not frighten him ! ' she told them , and the old women promised their protection"
宝玉 只得 前去 ， 一步 挪 不了 三寸 ， 蹭 到 这边 来 。,"Obliged to go , yet still reluctant , Bao-yu contrived to do so at so dawdling a pace that each step can have advanced him only a few inches upon his way ."
可巧 贾政 在 王夫人 房中 商议 事情 ， 金钏儿 、 彩云 、 ｛ 彩霞 ｝ 、 绣 鸾 、 绣凤 等 众 丫鬟 都 廊檐 下 站 着 呢 ， 一 见 宝玉 来 ， 都 抿着嘴 儿 笑 他 。,"It so happened that Jia Zheng had gone for the purpose of discussing these matters into Lady Wang 's room and Lady Wang 's maids Golden , Suncloud , Sunset , Avis and Avocet were standing outside under the eaves . Their amusement when they caught sight of Bao-yu advancing at this snail 's pace into the courtyard was evident from the expression on their faces ."
金钏儿 一把 拉 着 宝玉 ， 悄悄的 说道 ： “ 我 这 嘴上 是 才 擦 的 香香甜甜 的 胭脂 ， 你 这 会子 可 吃 不吃 了 ？ ”,"Golden seized him by the hand , and thrusting out a pair of heavily carmined lips , she said to him in a whisper : ' Look at that byootifulipstick ! I have only just put it on . Would not you like a taste of it ? '"
彩云 一把 推开 金钏儿 ， 笑 道 ： “ 人家 心里 发虚 ， 你 还 惬他 ！,"Suncloud , with a suppressed giggle , pushed her off him : ' Can not you see how scared he is ? It is mean of you to tease him at a time like this !"
— — 趁 这 会子 喜欢 ， 快进去 罢 。 ”,"He is in a good mood , ' she said to Bao-yu . ' You would better go in straight away , while it lasts ! '"
宝玉 只得 挨门 进去 。 原来 贾 政和 王夫人 都 在 里间 呢 。,"Bao-yu entered in a sort of sideways crouch , the picture of a submissive son - a gesture that was wasted , however , since his father and mother were in the inner room at the back ."
赵姨娘 打 起 帘子 来 ， 宝玉 〈 躬身 进去 〉 ， 只见 贾 政和 王夫人 对 坐在 炕 上 说话 儿 ， 地下 一溜 椅子 ， 迎春 、 探春 、 惜春 、 贾环 四 人 都 坐在 那里 。,"Aunt Zhao raised the inner room 's portiere to admit him . He bowed to her and entered . Jia Zheng and Lady Wang sat facing each other on the kang talking . Ying-chun , Tan-chun , Xi-chun and Jia Huan were sitting on a row of chairs below ."
一 见 他 进来 ， 探春 惜春 和 贾环 都 站 起来 。,"Ying-chun remained seated at his entrance , but the other three rose to their feet ."
贾政 一 举目 见 宝玉 站 在 眼前 ， 神彩 飘逸 ， 秀色 夺 人 ； 又 看看 贾环 人物 委琐 ， 举止 粗糙 ， — — 忽 又 想起 贾珠 来 。,"Jia Zheng glanced up and saw Bao-yu standing before him . The lively intelligence that shone in the boy 's every feature , his almost breath-taking beauty of countenance contrasted strikingly with Jia Huan 's cringing , hang-dog looks and loutish demeanour , and Jia Zheng thought suddenly of his other son , Jia Zhu , his Firstborn , whom he had lost ."
再 看看 王夫人 只有 这 一个 亲生 的 儿子 ， 素爱 如 珍 ； 自己 的 胡须 将 已 苍白 ： 因此 上 ， 把 平日 嫌恶 宝玉 之 心 ， 不觉 减 了 八九分 。,"He glanced at Lady Wang . Of the children she had borne him Bao-yu was now the only surviving son . He knew how much the boy meant to her . He thought of himself , too : ageing now , his beard already grey . And as he thought , much of his customary dislike of Bao-yu slipped away , so that for the time being perhaps only ten or twenty per cent of it still remained ."
半晌 说道 ： “ 娘娘 吩咐 说 ， 你 日日 在外 游嬉 ， 渐次 疏懒 了 工课 ， 如今 叫 禁管 你 和 姐妹 们 在 园里 读书 ， 你 可 好生 用心 学习 ； 再 不 守分安常 ， 你 可 仔细 着 ！ ”,"After what seemed to Bao-yu a very long time , he said : ' Her Grace has expressed a fear that by spending your time in constant amusement outside you may become an idler and a dullard , and she has directed that you and the girls should be moved into the garden so that you may be kept more closely at your books . See to it that you work hard and diligently ! If I detect any signs of your former unruliness and disobedience , you will be in for trouble ! '"
宝玉 连连 答应 了 几个 “ 是 ” 。,Bao-yu assented meekly .
王夫人 便 拉 他 在 身边 坐下 。 他 姊弟 三 人 依旧 坐下 ， 王夫人 摸索 着 宝玉 的 脖项 说道 ： “ 前儿 的 丸药 都 吃 完 了 没有 ？ ”,"Lady Wang took his hand and drew him up beside her on the kang . Now that he was seated , Jia Huan and the other two sat down once more in their chairs . Lady Wang stroked Bao-yu 's neck affectionately : ' Have you finished those pills I sent you the other day yet ? '"
宝玉 答应 道 ： “ 还有 一丸 。 ”,"' There is still one left , ' said Bao-yu ."
王夫人 道 ： “ 明儿 再取 十 丸 来 ， 天天 临睡 时候 ， 叫 袭 人 伏侍 你 吃 了 再 睡 。 ”,' You must come for some more tomorrow . I will give you another ten . You must get Aroma to give you one every night before you go to sleep . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 从 太太 吩咐 了 ， 袭 人 天天 临睡 打发 我 吃 的 。 ”,"' Yes . You told Aroma , Mother . She is been giving me one every night , as you said . '"
贾政便 问道 ： “ 谁 叫 ‘ 袭 人 ’ ？ ”,"' Who is this "" Aroma "" ? ' asked Jia Zheng sharply ."
王夫人 道 ： “ 是 个 丫头 。 ”,"' A maid , ' said Lady Wang ."
贾政道 ： “ 丫头 不拘 叫 个 什么 罢了 ， 是 谁 起 这样 刁钻 名字 ？ ”,"' I suppose there are no limits to what a maid may be called , ' said Jia Zheng , ' but who would have picked an outlandish name like that to give her ? '"
王夫人 见 贾政 不 喜欢 了 ， 便 替 宝玉 掩饰 道 ： “ 是 老太太 起 的 。 ”,Lady Wang could see that he was displeased and did her best to cover up for Bao-yu : ' I think it was Lady Jia who gave her the name . '
贾政道 ： “ 老太太 如何 晓得 这样的话 ？ 一定 是 宝玉 。 ”,"' Mother would never think of a name like that , ' said Jia Zheng . ' It must have been Bao-yu . '"
宝玉 见 瞒不过 ， 只得 起身 回 道 ： “ 因素 日 读诗 ， 曾 记 古人 有 句 诗云 ： ‘ 花气 袭 人 知 昼 暖 ’ ， 因 这 丫头 姓 ‘ 花 ’ ， 便 随意 起 的 。 ”,Bao-yu saw that a frank avowal was now unavoidable and rose to his feet :
王夫人 忙 向宝玉 说道 ： “ 你 回去 改 了 罢 。,"' This maid has a surname which means "" Flowers "" . There is a line in an old poem I happened to remember The flowers ' aroma breathes of hotter days and so I named her after that , '"
— — 老爷 也 不用 为 这 小事 生气 。 ”,"' When you get back you must change the name at once , ' said Lady Wang hurriedly to Bao-yu . ' Come , Sir Zheng ' - this to her husband - you are not going to get angry about a little thing like that ? '"
贾政道 ： “ 其实 也 无 妨碍 ， 不用 改 。 只 可见 宝玉 不 务正 ， 专 在 这些 浓词 艳诗 上 做 工夫 。 ”,"' It does not really matter , said Jia Zheng , and there is no need for him to change the name ; but it demonstrates what I have always said about the boy : he is fundamentally incapable of caring about serious matters and preoccupies himself with poetic frivolities and other such airy-fairy nonsense as a substitute for solid learning ."
说 毕 ， 断喝 了 一声 ： “ 作孽 的 畜生 ， 还 不 出去 ！ ”,Wretched fellow ! ' he shouted at Bao-yu . ' What are you waiting for ? '
王夫人 也 忙 道 ： “ 去 罢 ， 去 罢 ！,"' Go now , go now ! ' said Lady Wang in a flutter ."
怕 老太太 等 吃饭 呢 。 ”,' Grandma is probably waiting to begin her dinner . '
宝玉 答应 了 ， 慢慢 的 退出 去 ； 向 金钏儿 笑 着 伸 伸舌头 ， 带 着 两个 老嬷嬷 ， 一溜烟 去 了 。,"Bao-yu murmured a reply and retired , rather more slowly than was necessary . Emerging from the outer door , he grinned and stuck his tongue out at Golden , then shot off like a puff of smoke , the two old nannies hurrying after him ."
刚至 穿堂门 前 ， 只见 袭 人 倚门 而立 ， 见 宝玉 平安 回来 ， 堆下 笑 来 ， 问道 ： “ 叫 你 做 什么 ？ ”,Arriving at the entrance of the covered passage-way he came upon Aroma leaning in the doorway . Her face lit up when she saw him returning unscathed and she asked him what his father had wanted to see him about .
宝玉 告诉 ： “ 没有 什么 ， 不过 怕 我 进园 淘气 ， 吩咐 吩咐 。 ”,"' Oh , nothing much , ' said Bao-yu . ' He just wanted to say a few words about not getting up to mischief after we ve moved into the garden . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 回至 贾母 跟前 ， 回明 原委 。,"Having answered Aroma , he went in to see his grandmother and told her about the interview ."
只见 黛玉 正在 那里 ， 宝玉 便 问 他 ： “ 你 住 在 那 一处 好 ？ ”,He found Dai-yu with her and asked her which part of the garden she planned to live in .
黛玉正 盘算 这 事 ， 忽 见 宝玉 一 问 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 我 心里 想着 潇湘 馆 好 。,"It appeared that she had just been considering this question herself , for her answer was a prompt one : ' I have been thinking how nice it would be in the Naiad 's House ."
我 爱 那 几竿 竹子 ， 隐 着 一道 曲栏 ， 比 别处 幽静 些 。 ”,"I love all those bamboos and the little winding , half-hidden walk . It is so quiet and peaceful there . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 拍手 笑 道 ： “ 合 了 我 的 主意 了 ！ 我 也 要 叫 你 那里 住 。 我 就 住 怡红院 。 咱们 两个 又 近 ， 又 都 清幽 。 ”,"Bao-yu clapped his hands delightedly : ' Just what I would have chosen for you ! I was hoping you would want to live there , because I want to live in the House of Green Delights - which means that we should be neighbours . And both places are quiet and tucked away '"
二人 正 计议 着 ， 贾政 遣 人 来回 贾母 ， 说 是 ： “ 二月 二十二日 是 好日子 ， 哥儿 姐儿们 就 搬进 去 罢 。 这 几日 便 遣 人 进去 分派 收拾 。 ”,They were still discussing their plans when a servant arrived from Jia Zheng with a message for Grandmother Jia . It was to say that the twenty-second of the second month being a Lucky Day was the date on which Bao-yu and the girls were to move into the garden . Servants were to be allowed inside in the interim in order to make the rooms ready for them .
宝钗 住 了 蘅 芜芜 院 ， 黛玉 住 了 潇湘 馆 ， 迎春 住 了 ｛ 紫菱洲 ｝ ， 探春 住 了 〈 秋爽斋 〉 ， 惜春 住 了 ｛ 藕 香榭 ｝ ， 李 纨住了 稻香村 ， 宝玉 住 了 怡红院 。,"It was finally settled that Bao-chai should have All-spice Court , Dai-yu the Naiad 's House , Ying-chun the building on Amaryllis Eyot , Tan-chun the Autumn Studio , Xi-chun the Lotus Pavilion , Li Wan Sweet-rice Village , and Bao-yu the House of Green Delights ."
每一处 添 两个 老嬷嬷 ， 四个 丫头 ， 除 各人 的 奶娘 亲随 丫头 外 ， 另 有 专管 收拾 打扫 的 。,"Each set of rooms was allotted two old women and four maids in addition to the occupant 's existing maids and nannies , and there were other servants whose sole duty was sweeping and cleaning ."
至 二十二日 ， 一齐 进去 ， 登时 园内 花招 绣带 ， 柳拂 香风 ， 不似 前 番 那 等 寂寞 了 。,"On the twenty-second of the second month everyone moved in . The silent , deserted garden suddenly came to life - Live flowers on silk-embroidered flowers up-glanced , And unguent scents the scents of spring enhanced as the bevy of gaily-dressed , chattering girls spread themselves through its quiet walks ."
闲 言少叙 ， 且说 宝玉 自 进园 来 ， 心满意足 ， 再 无 别项 可生 贪求 之 心 ， 每日 只 和 姊妹 丫鬟 们 一处 ， 或 读书 ， 或 写字 ， 或 弹琴 下棋 ， 作画 吟诗 ， 以至 描鸾 刺 凤 ， 斗草 簪花 ， 低吟 悄唱 ， 拆字 猜枚 ， 无所不至 ， 倒 也 十分 快意 。,"But to return to our hero . Life for Bao-yu after his removal into the garden became utterly and completely satisfying . Every day was spent in the company of his maids and cousins in the most amiable and delightful occupations , such as reading , practising calligraphy , strumming on the qin , playing Go , painting , composing verses , embroidering in coloured silks , competitive flower-collecting , making flower-sprays , singing ; word games and guess-fingers . In a word , he was blissfully happy ."
他 曾 有 几首 四时 即 事 诗 ， 虽 不算 好 ， 却是 真情 真景 。,"One product of this period was a set of four Garden Nights poems which , though they have little claim to poetic merit , give a fairly accurate impression of the mood and setting of those carefree days :"
“ 春夜 即 事 ” 云 ：,I. Spring
霞 绡 云 幄 任 铺陈 ，,"Behind silk hangings , in warm quilts cocooned ,"
隔巷 〈 蟇 更 〉 听 未 真 。,His ears half doubt the watch-drums ' muted sound .
枕上 轻寒 窗外 雨 ，,"Rain at his window strikes , the pillow 's cold ;"
眼前 春色 梦中人 。,Yet to the sleeper 's eyes spring dreams unfold .
盈盈 烛泪 因 谁 泣 ，,Why does the candle shed its waxen tear ?
点点 花 愁 为 我 嗔 。,Why on each flower do angry drops appear ?
自 是 小鬟 娇懒 惯 ，,By uncouth din of giggling maids distressed
拥 衾 不 耐 笑 言 频 。,He burrows deeper in his silken nest .
“ 夏夜 即 事 ” 云 ：,II. Summer
倦 绣 佳人 幽梦 长 ，,A tired maid sleeps at her embroidery .
金笼 鹦鹉 唤 茶汤 。,A parrot in its gilt cage calls for tea .
窗明 麝月 开 宫镜 ，,"Pale moonbeams on an opened mirror fall ,"
室 霭 檀 云品 御香 。,And burning sandal makes a fragrant pall .
琥珀 杯 倾荷 露滑 ，,From amber cups thirst-quenching nectar flows .
玻璃 槛 纳柳 风凉 。,"A willow-breeze through crystal curtains blows ,"
水亭 处处 齐 纨动 ，,"In pool-side kiosks light-clad maidens flit ,"
帘卷 朱楼 罢 晚妆 。,"Or ; dressed for bed , by open casements sit ."
“ 秋夜 即 事 ” 云 ：,III . Autumn
绛 芸轩里绝 喧哗 ，,"In Red Rue Study , far from worldly din ,"
桂魄 流光 浸 茜 纱 。,Through rosy gauze moonlight comes flooding in .
苔锁 石纹 容 睡 鹤 ，,"Outside , a crane sleeps on moss-wrinkled rocks ,"
井飘桐 露 湿 栖 鸦 。,And dew from well-side trees the crow 's wings soaks .
抱 衾 婢至 舒金凤 ，,A maid the great quill 's golden bird has spread ;
倚 槛 人 归落 翠花 。,Her languid master droops his raven head .
静夜 不眠 因酒 渴 ，,"Wine-parched and sleepless , in the still night he cries"
沉烟 重 拨索 烹茶 。,"For tea , and soon thick smoke and steam arise ."
“ 冬夜 即 事 ” 云 ：,IV. Winter
梅魂竹 梦 已三 更 ，,"Midnight and winter : plum with bamboo sleeps ,"
锦 罽 鹴 衾 睡 未 成 。,While one midst Indian rugs his vigil keeps .
松影 一庭 惟 见 鹤 ，,Only a crane outside is to be found -
梨花 满地 不 闻 莺 。,"No orioles now , though white flowers mash the ground ."
女奴 翠袖 诗怀冷 ，,Chill strikes the maid 's bones through her garments fine ;
公子 金貂 酒力 轻 。,Her fur-clad master 's somewhat worse for wing ;
却 喜 侍儿 知试 茗 ，,"But , in tea-making mysteries deep-shilled ,"
扫 将 新 雪 及时 烹 。,She has with new-swept snow the kettle filled .
不 说 宝玉 闲吟 ， 且说 这 几首 诗 ， 当时 有 一等 势利 人 ， 见 是 荣国府 十二三岁 的 公子 做 的 ， 抄录 出来 ， 各处 称颂 ； 再有 等 轻薄 子弟 ， 爱 上 那 风流 妖艳 之句 ， 也 写 在 扇头 壁上 ， 不时 吟哦 赏赞 ： 因此 上 竟 有人 来 寻 诗 觅 字 ， 倩 画求题 ， 这 宝玉 一发 得意 了 ， 每日 家 做 这些 外务 。,"The indifferent quality of these poems did not prevent members of that class of worldlings who see merit in a name and excellence in a title from copying them out and proclaiming them everywhere as miracles of precocious talent when they discovered that their author was the thirteen-year-old heir apparent of Sir Jia of Rong-guo House . There were also a number of bright young things who professed an extravagant liking for the deliciousness of the poems , and who copied them on to fans and wall-spaces and recited them on the least provocation ( or none at all ) at social gatherings . Soon Bao-yu was being besieged with requests for more poems , for specimens of his calligraphy , for paintings , for inscriptions . He began to feel himself a lion and was kept constantly busy with these dilettantish ' duties ' ."
谁 想 静 中 生动 ， 忽 一日 ， 不自在 起来 ， 这 也 不好 ， 那 也 不好 ， 出来 进去 ， 只是 发闷 。,"Then , quite suddenly , in the midst of this placid , agreeable existence , he was discontented . He got up one day feeling out of sorts . Nothing he did brought any relief . Whether he stayed indoors or went out into the garden , he remained bored and miserable ."
园中 那些 女孩子 ， 正是 混沌 世界 天真烂漫 之 时 ， 坐卧 不避 ， 嬉笑 无心 ， 那里 知 宝玉 此时 的 心事 ？,"The garden 's female population were mostly still in that age of innocence when freedom from inhibition is the fruit of ignorance . Waking and sleeping they surrounded him , and their mindless giggling was constantly in his ears . How could they understand the restless feelings that now consumed him ?"
那宝玉 不自在 ， 便 懒 在 园内 ， 只 想 外头 鬼混 ， 却 痴痴 的 ， 又 说不出 什么 滋味 来 。,In his present mood of discontent he was bored with the garden and its inmates ; yet his attempts to find distraction outside it ended in the same emptiness and ennui .
茗 烟 见 他 这样 ， 因想 与 他 开心 ， 左思右想 ， 皆 是 宝玉 玩 烦 了 的 ， 只有 一件 ， 不曾 见 过 。,"Tealeaf saw how it was with him and racked his brains for a remedy . Unfortunately all the things he could think of seemed to be things that Bao-yu had already tried and grown tired of . But no , there was something he had not yet tried ."
想毕 ， 便 走到 书坊 内 ， 把 那 古今 小说 ， 并 那飞燕 、 合德 、 则 天 、 玉环 的 “ 外传 ” ， 与 那 传奇 角本 ， 买 了 许多 ， 孝敬 宝玉 。,"As soon as Tealeaf thought of it , he set off to the book-stalls and bought a pile of books - books of a kind Bao-yu had never heard about - to give as a present to his young master . His purchases included Old Inklubber 's Stories Old and New The Secret History of Flying Swallow Sister of Flying Swallow The Infamous Loves of Empress Wu The Jade Ring Concubine , or Peeps in the Inner Palace and a heap of playbooks - mostly romantic comedies and the like ."
宝玉 一 看 ， 如 得 珍宝 。 茗 烟 又 嘱咐 道 ： “ 不可 拿进 园 去 ， 叫 人 知道 了 ， 我 就 ‘ 吃不了兜着走 ’ 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu took one look at this gift and was enraptured ; but Tealeaf uttered a warning : ' Do not take these into the garden ! If you do , and anyone finds out about them , I will be in real trouble - more than just a bellyful !"
宝玉 那里 肯 不 拿 进去 ？,The injunction was one with which Bao-yu was most unwilling to comply .
踟蹰 再 四 ， 单 把 那 文理 雅 道 些 的 ， 拣 了 几套 进去 ， 放在 床 顶上 ， 无人 时方 看 ； 那 粗俗 过露 的 ， 都 藏于 外面 书房 内 。,"After a good deal of hesitation he picked out a few of the chaster volumes to keep by his bed and read when no one was about , and left the cruder , more forthright ones behind , hidden somewhere in his outer study ."
那日 正当 三月中 浣 ， 早饭 后 ， 宝玉 携 了 一套 《 会 真记 》 ， 走到 沁 芳 闸 桥 那边 桃花 底下 一块 石 上 坐 着 ， 展开 《 会 真记 》 ， 从头 细看 。,"One day after lunch - it was round about the Midwash of the third month , as our forefathers , who measured the passage of time by their infrequent ablutions , were will not to say - Bao-yu set off for Drenched Blossoms Weir with the volumes of Western Chamber under his arm , and sitting down on a rock underneath the peach-tree which grew there beside the bridge , he took up the first volume and began , very attentively , to read the play ."
正 看到 “ 落红成阵 ” ， 只见 一阵风 过 ， 树上 桃花 吹 下 一大 斗来 ， 落得 满身 满 书 满地 皆 是 花片 。,"He had just reached the line The red flowers in their hosts are falling when a little gust of wind blew over and a shower of petals suddenly rained down from the tree above , covering his clothes , his book and all the ground about him ."
宝玉 要抖 将 下来 ， 恐怕 脚步 践踏 了 ， 只得 兜 了 那 花瓣儿 ， 来 至 池边 ， 抖 在 池内 。,"He did not like to shake them off for fear they got trodden underfoot , so collecting as many of them as he could in the lap of his gown , he carried them to the water 's edge and shook them in ."
那 花瓣儿 浮 在 水面 ， 飘飘荡荡 ， 竟 流出 沁 芳 闸 去 了 。,The petals bobbed and circled for a while on the surface of the water before finally disappearing over the weir .
回来 只见 地下 还有 许多 花瓣 ， 宝玉 正 踟蹰 间 ， 只 听 背后 有人 说道 ： “ 你 在 这里 做 什么 ？ ”,When he got back he found that a lot more of them had fallen while he was away .
宝玉 一 回头 ， 却是 黛玉 来 了 ： 肩上 担着 花 锄 ， 花 锄 上 挂 着 纱 囊 ， 手内 拿 着 花帚 。,"As he hesitated , a voice behind him said , ' What are you doing here ? '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 来 的 正好 ， 你 把 这些 花瓣儿 都 扫 起来 ， 撂 在 那 水里去 罢 。,He looked round and saw that it was Dai-yu . She was carrying a garden hoe with a muslin bag hanging from the end of it on her shoulder and a garden broom in her hand .
我 才 撂 了 好些 在 那里 了 。 ”,"' You have come just at the right moment , ' said Bao-yu , smiling at her . ' Here , sweep these petals up and tip them in the water for me ! I have just tipped one lot in myself . '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 撂 在 水里 不好 ， 你 看 这里 的 水 干净 ， 只 一流 出去 ， 有 人家 的 地方 〈 脏 的 臭 的 混倒 ， 〉 仍旧 把 花 遭塌 了 。,"' It is not a good idea to tip them in the water , ' said Dai-yu . ' The water you see here is clean , but farther on beyond the weir , where it flows past people 's houses , there are all sorts of muck and impurity , and in the end they get spoiled just the same ."
那 畸 角儿 上 我 有 一个 花冢 ， 如今 把 他 扫 了 ， 装 在 这 绢 袋里 ， 埋 在 那里 ； 日 久 随 土 化 了 ， 岂 不 干净 。 ”,"In that corner over there I have got a grave for the flowers , and what I am doing now is sweeping them up and putting them in this silk bag to bury them there , so that they can gradually turn back into earth . Is not that a cleaner way of disposing of them ? '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 喜不自禁 ， 笑 道 ： “ 待 我 放下 书 ， 帮 你 来 收拾 。 ”,Bao-yu was full of admiration for this idea . ' Just let me put this book somewhere and I will give you a hand . '
黛玉 道 ： “ 什么 书 ？ ”,' What book ? ' said Dai-yu .
宝玉 见 问 ， 慌 的 藏 了 ， 便 说道 ： “ 不过 是 《 中庸 》 《 大学 》 。 ”,"' Oh. . . The Doctrine of the Mean and The Greater Learning , ' he said , hastily concealing it ."
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 又 在 我 跟前 弄鬼 。 趁早 儿 给 我 瞧瞧 ， 好 多着呢 ！ ”,"' Do not try to fool me ! ' said Dai-yu . ' You would have done much better to let me look at it in the first place , instead of hiding it so guiltily . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 妹妹 ， 要论 你 ， 我 是 不怕 的 。 你 看 了 ， 好歹 别 告诉 人 。,"' In your case , coz , I have nothing to be afraid of , ' said Bao-yu ; ' but if I do let you look , you must promise not to tell anyone ."
真是 好 文章 ！,It is marvellous stuff .
你 要 看 了 ， 连 饭 也 不想 吃 呢 ！ ”,"Once you start reading it , you will even stop wanting to eat ! '"
一面 说 ， 一面 递过去 。,"He handed the book to her , and Dai-yu put down her things and looked ."
黛玉 把 花具 放下 ， 接书 来 瞧 ， 从头 看 去 ， 越 看 越 爱 ， 不 顿饭 时 ， 已 看 了 好几 出 了 。,"The more she read , the more she liked it , and before very long she had read several acts ."
但 觉 词句 警人 ， 余香满口 。,She felt the power of the words and their lingering fragrance .
一面 看 了 ， 只管 出神 ， 心内 还 默默 记诵 。,"Long after she had finished reading , when she had laid down the book and was sitting there rapt and silent , the lines continued to ring on in her head ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 妹妹 ， 你 说 好不好 ？ ”,"' Well , ' said Bao-yu , ' is it good ? '"
黛玉 笑 着 点头 儿 。,Dai-yu smiled and nodded .
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 就是 个 ‘ 多愁多病 的 身 ’ ， 你 就是 那 ‘ 倾国倾城 的 貌 ’ 。 ”,"Bao-yu laughed : ' How can I , full of sickness and of woe , Withstand that face which kingdoms could o ' erthrow ? '"
黛玉 听 了 ， 不觉 带 腮 连 耳 都 通红 了 ， 登时 竖起 两道 似 蹙 非 蹙 的 眉 ， 瞪 了 一双 似睁非 睁 的 眼 ， 桃 腮 带怒 ， 薄面 含嗔 ， 指着 宝玉 道 ： “ 你 这 该死 的 ， 胡说 了 ！ 好好儿 的 ， 把 这些 淫词艳曲 弄 了 来 ， 说 这些 混账 话 ， 欺负 我 。 我 告诉 舅舅 、 舅母 去 ！ ”,Dai-yu reddened to the tips of her ears . The eyebrows that seemed to frown yet somehow did not were raised now in anger and the lovely eyes flashed . There was rage in her crimson cheeks and resentment in all her looks . ' You are hateful ! ' - she pointed a finger at him in angry accusal - ' deliberately using that horrid play to take advantage of me . I am going straight off to tell Uncle and Aunt ! '
— — 说 到 “ 欺负 ” 二 字 ， 就 把 眼圈儿 红 了 ， 转身 就 走 。,"At the words ' take advantage of me ' her eyes filled with tears , and as she finished speaking she turned from him and began to go ."
宝玉 急 了 ， 忙 向前 拦住 道 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 千万 饶 我 这 一遭 儿 罢 ！,"Bao-yu rushed after her and held her back : ' Please , please forgive me ! Dearest coz !"
要 有心 欺负 你 ， 明儿 我 掉 在 池子 里 ， 叫 个 癞头 鼋吃 了 去 ， 变 个 大忘八 ， 等 你 明儿 做 了 ‘ 一品夫人 ’ 病 老 归西 的 时候 儿 ， 我 往 你 坟 上 替 你 驼 一辈子 碑 去 。 ”,"If I had the slightest intention of taking advantage of you , may I fall into the water and be eaten up by an old bald-headed turtle ! When you have become a great lady and gone at last to your final resting-place , I shall become the stone turtle that stands in front of your grave and spend the rest of eternity carrying your tombstone on my back as a punishment ! '"
说 的 黛玉 “ 扑嗤 ” 的 一声 笑 了 ， 一面 揉 着眼 ， 一面 笑 道 ： “ 一般 唬 的 这么 个 样儿 ， 还 只管 胡说 。 — — 呸 ！ 原来 也 是 个 ‘ 银样 蜡 枪头 ’ ！ ”,"His ridiculous declamation provoked a sudden explosion of mirth . She laughed and simultaneously wiped the tears away with her knuckles : ' Look at you - the same as ever ! Scared as anything , but you still have to go on talking nonsense . Well , I know you now for what you are : "" Of silver spear the leaden counterfeit "" ! '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你 说 说 ， 你 这个 呢 ？ 我 也 告诉 去 。 ”,' Well ! You can talk ! ' said Bao-yu laughing . ' Listen to you ! Now I am going off to tell on you ! '
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 你 说 你 会 ‘ 过目成诵 ’ ， 难道 我 就 不能 ‘ 一目十行 ’ 了 ！ ”,"' You need not imagine you are the only one with good memory , ' said Dai-yu haughtily . ' I suppose I am allowed to remember lines too if I like . '"
宝玉 一面 收书 ， 一面 笑 道 ： “ 正经 快 把 花儿 埋 了 罢 ， 别提 那些 个 了 。 ”,Bao-yu took back the book from her with a good-natured laugh : ' Never mind about all that now ! Let's get on with this flower-burying ! '
二人 便 收拾 落花 。,And the two of them set about sweeping together the fallen flower-petals and putting them into the bag .
正才 掩埋 妥协 ， 只见 袭 人 走来 ， 说道 ： “ 那里 没 找到 ？ 摸 在 这里 来 了 ！,They had just finished burying it when Aroma came hurrying up to them : ' So there you are ! I have been looking for you everywhere .
那边 大老爷 身上 不好 ， 姑娘 们 都 过去 请安 去 了 ， 老太太 叫 打发 你 去 呢 。,Your Uncle She is not well and the young ladies have all gone over to visit him . Her Old Ladyship says you are to go as well .
快回去 换 衣裳 罢 。 ”,You would better come back straight away and get changed ! '
宝玉 听 了 ， 忙 拿 了 书 ， 别 了 黛玉 ， 同 袭 人 回房 换衣 不 提 。,"Bao-yu picked up his book , took leave of Dai-yu , and accompanied Aroma back to his room . And there , for the moment , we shall leave him ."
这里 黛 玉见宝玉 去 了 ， 听见 众 姐妹 也 不在 房中 ， 自己 闷闷 的 。,"With Bao-yu gone and the girls evidently all out , Dai-yu began to feel lonely and depressed ."
正 欲 回房 ， 刚 走 到 梨 香院 墙角 外 ， 只 听见 墙内 笛韵 悠扬 ， 歌声 婉转 ， 黛玉 便 知 是 那 十二个 女孩子 演习 戏文 。,"She was on her way back to her own room and was just passing by the corner of Pear Tree Court when she heard the languorous meanderings of a flute and the sweet modulation of a girlish voice coming from the other side of the wall , and knew that the twelve little actresses were at their rehearsal inside ."
虽 未 留心 去 听 ， 偶然 两句 吹 到 耳朵 内 ， 明明白白 一 字 不 落道 ： “ 原来 是 姹紫嫣红 开遍 ， 似 这般 ， 都 付与 断井颓垣 … … ”,"Although she was paying no particular attention to the singing , a snatch of it chanced suddenly to fall with very great clarity on her ear , so that she was able to make out quite distinctly the words of two whole lines of the aria being sung ' Here multiflorate splendour blooms forlorn Midst broken fountains , mouldering walls - '"
黛玉 听 了 ， 倒 也 十分 感慨 缠绵 ， 便 止步 侧耳细听 ， 又 唱道 是 ： “ 良辰美景 奈何 天 ， 赏心乐事 谁家 院 … … ”,"They moved her strangely , and she stopped to listen . The voice went on : ' And the bright air , the brilliant morn Feed my despair Joy and gladness have withdrawn To other gardens , other halls - '"
听 了 这 两句 ， 不觉 点头 自叹 ， 心下 自思 ： “ 原来 戏 上 也 有 好 文章 ， 可惜 世人 只 知 看戏 ， 未必 能 领略 其中 的 趣味 。 ”,"At this point the listener unconsciously nodded her head and sighed . ' It is true , ' she thought , ' there is good poetry even in plays . What a pity most people think of them only as entertainment . A lot of the real beauty in them must go unappreciated . '"
想毕 ， 又 后悔 不该 胡 想 ， 耽误 了听 曲子 。,She suddenly became aware that her mind was wandering and regretted that her inattention had caused her to miss some of the singing .
再 听 时 ， 恰 唱 到 ： “ 只为 你 如花美眷 ， 似水流年 … … ”,"She listened again . This time it was another voice : ' Because for you , my flowerlike fair ; The swift years like the waters flow - '"
黛玉 听 了 这 两句 ， 不觉 心动 神摇 。,The words moved her to the depth of her being .
又 听道 “ 你 在 幽 闺 自怜 … … ” 等 句 ， 越发 如醉如痴 ， 站立 不住 ， 便 一 蹲身 坐在 一块 山子石 上 ， 细嚼 “ 如花美眷 ， 似水流年 ” 八个 字 的 滋味 。,"' I have sought you everywhere , And at last I find you here , In a dark room full of woe - ' It was like intoxication , a sort of delirium . Her legs would no longer support her . She collapsed on to a near-by rockery and crouched there , the words turning over and over in her mind : Because for you , my flowerlike fair , The swift years like the waters flow . . ."
忽 又 想起 前日 见 古人 诗 中 ， 有 “ 水流花谢 两 无情 ” 之句 ， 再 词 中 又 有 “ 流水落花 春去 也 ， 天上人间 ” 之句 ； 又 兼 方才 所 见 《 西厢记 》 中 “ 花落 水流 红 ， 闲愁万种 ” 之句 ： 都 一时 想 起来 ， 凑聚 在 一处 。,"Suddenly she thought of a line from an old poem she had read quite recently : Relentlessly the waters flow , the flowers fade . From that her mind turned to those famous lines written in his captivity by the tragic poet-emperor of Later Tang : The blossoms fall , the water flows , The glory of the spring is gone In nature 's world as in the human one - and to some lines from The Western Chamber which she had just been reading : As flowers fall and the flowing stream runs red , A thousand sickly fancies crowd the mind . All these different lines and verses combined into a single overpowering impression , riving her soul with a pang of such keen anguish that the tears started from her eyes ."
仔细 忖度 ， 不觉 心痛 神驰 ， 眼中 落泪 。 正 没 个 开交 处 ， 忽 觉身 背后 有人 拍 了 他 一下 ， 及至 回头 看 时 ， — — 未知 是 谁 ， 下回分解 。,"She might have remained there indefinitely , weeping and comfortless , had not someone just at that moment come up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder . She turned to look and saw that it was - But if you wish to know who it was , you must read the next chapter !"
第二十四回,Chapter 24
醉金刚 轻财 尚义 侠,The Drunken Diamond shows nobility of character in handling his money
痴 女儿 遗帕 惹 相思,And the Quiet-voiced Girl provides material for fantasy by losing her handkerchief
话 说 黛玉 正在 情思 萦逗 、 缠绵 固结 之 时 ， 忽 有人 从 背后 拍 了 一下 ， 说道 ： “ 你 作 什么 一个 人 在 这里 ？ ”,"As Dai-yu continued to crouch there , a prisoner of her own sorrowful thoughts and emotions , someone suddenly came up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder : ' What are you doing here all on your own ? '"
黛玉 唬 了 一 跳 ， 回头 看 时 ， 不是 别人 ， 却是 香菱 。,She looked round with a start . It was Caltrop .
黛玉 道 ： “ 你 这个 傻丫头 ， 冒冒失失 的 唬 我一 跳 ！ 这 会子 打 那里 来 ？ ”,"' You silly girl ! ' said Dai-yu . You gave me quite a shock , creeping up on me like that . Where have you just come from ? '"
香菱 嘻嘻 的 笑道 ： “ 我 来 找 我们 姑娘 ， 总 找不着 ， — — 你们 紫鹃 也 找 你 呢 ！ 说 琏 二 奶奶 送 了 什么 茶叶 来 了 。 回家 去 坐 着 罢 。 ”,"Caltrop laughed mischievously : ' I have been looking for our young lady , but I can not find her anywhere . Your Nightingale is looking for you too , by the way . She says Mrs Lian has sent you - I think it is some kind of tea . Shall I go with you ? '"
一面 说 ， 一面 拉 着 黛玉 的 手 ， 回 潇湘 馆 来 ， 果然 凤姐 送 了 两 小瓶 上用 新 茶叶 来 。,She took her by the hand and accompanied her back to the Naiad 's House . The present from Xi-feng she had mentioned was waiting there when they arrived : two little cylindrical containers of a new tea supplied to the Palace for the Emperor 's own use .
黛玉 和 香菱 坐 了 ， 谈 讲 些 这 一个 绣 的 好 ， 那 一个 扎 的 精 ， 又 下 一回 棋 ， 看 两句 书 ， 香菱 便 走 了 ， 不在话下 。,"The two girls sat down and discussed the relative merits of various pieces of embroidery , played a little Go , and looked at one or two books . Then Caltrop went off again . Our narrative leaves them at this point and passes to other matters ."
且说 宝玉 因 被 袭 人 找回 房 去 ， 只见 鸳鸯 歪 在 床上 看袭 人 的 针线 呢 ， 见 宝玉 来 了 ， 便 说道 ： “ 你 往 那里 去 了 ？,"Recalled to his own apartment by Aroma , Bao-yu arrived back to find his grandmother 's maid Faithful reclining on the couch examining Aroma 's needlework . ' Where have you been ? ' she said , as soon as she saw him enter ."
老太太 等 着 你 呢 ， 叫 你 过 那边 请 大老爷 的 安去 。 还 不快 去 换 了 衣裳 走 呢 ！ ”,' Her Old Ladyship is waiting for you . She wants you to go next door to see how your Uncle She is getting on . You would better hurry up and get changed ! '
袭 人 便 进房 去取 衣服 。,Aroma went into the next room to get his clothes .
宝玉 坐在 床沿 上 ， 褪 了 鞋 ， 等 靴子 穿 的 工夫 ， 回头见 鸳鸯 穿着 水红 绫子 袄 儿 ， 青 缎子 坎肩 儿 ， 下面 露 着 玉色 绸袜 ， 大红 绣鞋 ， 向 那边 低着头 看 针线 ， 脖子 上 围着 紫绸 绢子 。,"Bao-yu sat on the edge of the couch and kicked his shoes off . While he was waiting for his boots to come , he turned and scrutinized Faithful . She was wearing a pale strawberry-coloured dress of silk damask , a sleeveless black satin jacket , stockings of eggshell blue , and dark-red embroidered slippers . Her neck , which was towards him as she bent down once more to inspect the needlework , was encircled at its base by a reddish-purple silk scarf . A fascinating neck ."
宝玉 便 把 脸 凑 在 脖项 上 ， 闻 那 香气 ， 不住 用 手 摩挲 ： 其 白腻 不 在 袭 人 以下 。,He bent down over it to sniff its perfume and stroked it softly with his hand . It was as smooth and white as Aroma 's .
便 猴 上身 去 ， 涎着脸 笑 道 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 把 你 嘴上 的 胭脂 赏 我 吃 了 罢 ！ ” 一面 说 ， 一面 扭 股糖 似的 粘 在 身上 。,"With an impish chuckle he threw himself upon her and clung like sticky toffee about her person : ' Come on , Faithful darling , give us a taste of your lipstick ! '"
鸳鸯 便 叫 道 ： “ 袭 人 ， 你 出来 瞧瞧 ！,"Faithful called out to Aroma in the next room : ' Aroma , come in and look at this !"
你 跟 他 一辈子 ， 也 不 劝劝 他 ， 还是 这么着 。 ”,All the years you have been with him now - haven ' t you managed to cure him yet ? '
袭 人 抱 了 衣裳 出来 ， 向宝玉 道 ： “ 左劝 也 不 改 ， 右 劝 也 不 改 ， 你 到底 是 怎么着 ？,"Aroma came in with her arms full of clothes . ' I do not know what is the matter with you , ' she said to Bao-yu . ' Heaven knows , I have tried hard enough to cure you !"
你 再 这么着 ， 这个 地方 儿 可 也 就 难住 了 。 ”,"If you go on much longer like this , you are just going to make it impossible to go on living here any longer . '"
一边 说 ， 一边 催 他 穿 衣裳 ， 同 鸳鸯 往前面 来 ； 见 过 贾母 ， 出至 外面 ， 人马 俱 已 齐备 。 刚 欲 上马 ， 只见 贾琏 请安 回来 正 下马 。,"She hurried him on with his dressing . When he was ready , he accompanied Faithful to the front apartment to see Grandmother Jia . Going outside again , he found horse and servants ready waiting and was about to get into the saddle , when he noticed Jia Lian dismounting opposite , having just returned from his visit ."
二人 对面 ， 彼此 问 了 两句话 ， 只见 旁边 转过 一个 人 来 ， 说 ： “ 请 宝叔安 。 ”,The two cousins went up to each other and exchanged a few words . Just at that moment a figure emerged from the side of the courtyard and greeted Bao-yu : ' Uncle Bao ! How are you ? '
宝玉 看 时 ， 只见 这 人生 的 容长 脸儿 ， 长挑 身材 ， 年纪 只有 十八九岁 ， 甚实 斯文 清秀 。,"Bao-yu turned . It was a tall , thin youth of eighteen or nineteen who had spoken , with a thin , handsome face and an air of great natural refinement ."
虽然 面善 ， 却 想不起 是 那一 房 的 ， 叫 什么 名字 。,"Although his face was familiar , Bao-yu could not for the moment remember his name or which part of the clan he belonged to ."
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 你 怎么 发呆 ？,' You look very puzzled ! ' said Jia Lian amusedly .
连 他 也 不 认得 ？,Surely you know who this is ?
他 是 廊 下住 的 五 嫂子 的 儿子 芸儿 。 ”,"This is Jia Yun - Cousin Bu-shi 's boy , who lives in West Lane . '"
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 是 了 ， 我 怎么 就 忘 了 。 ” 因 问 他 ： “ 你 母亲 好 ？ 这 会子 什么 勾当 ？ ”,"' Yes , of course , ' said Bao-yu . ' I can not think what made me forget ! - How is your mother ? ' he asked Jia Yun . ' What business brings you here today ? '"
贾芸 指 贾琏 道 ： “ 找 二叔 说句话 。 ”,Jia Yun pointed to Jia Lian : ' I came here to have a word with Uncle Lian . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 倒 比先 越 发出 挑 了 ， 倒象 我 的 儿子 。 ”,"' You have grown very good-looking since I saw you last , ' said Bao-yu with a grin . ' You could almost be my son . '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 好 不 害臊 ！,' You have got a nerve ! ' said Jia Lian laughing .
人家 比 你 大 五六岁 呢 ， 就 给 你 作 儿子 了 ？ ”,' Your son ? He is five or six years older than you . '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 你 今年 十几岁 ？ ”,' How old are you then ? ' Bao-yu asked him .
贾芸道 ： “ 十八 了 。 ”,' Eighteen . '
原来 这 贾芸 最 伶俐乖巧 的 ， 听宝玉 说 “ 象 他 的 儿子 ” ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 俗话说 的 好 ， ‘ 摇车 儿 里 的 爷爷 ， 拄 拐棍儿 的 孙子 ’ ， 虽然 年纪 大 ， ‘ 山 高 遮不住 太阳 ’ — — 只 从 我 父亲 死 了 ， 这 几年 也 没人 照管 ， 宝叔 要 不 嫌 侄儿 蠢 ， 认做 儿子 ， 就是 侄儿 的 造化 了 。 ”,"Being a sharp-witted young man who knew how to make the most of an opportunity , Jia Yun was quick to turn Bao-yu 's jest to good account . ' There is a saying about "" grandsires in cradles and babbies with beards "" , you know ; and even if I am older than you , "" the highest mountain can not shut out the sun "" ! I have had no one to care for me during these last few years since my father died , and if you do not mind having so stupid a person for your son , I should certainly be very happy to have you for a father . '"
贾琏 笑 道 ： “ 你 听见 了 ？ 认 了 儿子 ， 不是 好 开交 的 。 ”,"' You hear that ? ' said Jia Lian . ' Now you have got yourself a son ! You will find that parenthood is no laughing matter , I can tell you ! '"
说 着 ， 笑 着 进去 了 。,"He left them and went inside , chuckling to himself ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 明儿 你 闲 了 ， 只管 来 找 我 ， 别 和 他们 鬼鬼祟祟 的 。,"Bao-yu smiled at his new ' son ' : ' Next time you are free , come and see me . Do not waste your time trying to join in their little intrigues !"
这 会子 我 不 得闲儿 ， 明日 你 到 书房 里 来 ， 我 和 你 说 一天 话儿 ， 我 带 你 园里 玩 去 。 ”,"I am afraid I am not free at the moment , but if you will come round to my study tomorrow , we can spend all day together , and I shall be able to show you round the garden . '"
说 着 ， 扳鞍 上马 ， 众 小厮 随往 贾 赦 这边 来 。,"With these words he mounted his horse and set off , his pages at his back , for Jia She is ."
见 了 贾 赦 ， 不过 是 偶感 些 风寒 。,Bao-yu found that his uncle was suffering from nothing more serious than a chill .
先述 了 贾母问 的话 ， 然后 自己 请 了 安 ， 贾 赦先 站 起来 回 了 贾母问 的话 ， 便 唤 人 来 ： “ 带 进 哥儿 去 太太 屋里 坐 着 。 ”,"He delivered his grandmother 's message first and then asked after his uncle on his own behalf . Jia She stood up to hear what his mother had to say , and when Bao-yu had finished , ordered a servant to take him to his Aunt Xing 's room ."
宝玉 退出 来 ， 至 后面 ， 到 上房 ， 邢夫人 见 了 ， 先 站 了 起来 请 过 贾母 的 安 ， 宝玉 方 请安 。,"Bao-yu withdrew and followed the servant through the back and across the courtyard to the main reception room . Seeing him enter , Lady Xing rose to her feet to ask after Grandmother Jia , then sat down again to be asked after in turn by Bao-yu ."
邢夫人 拉 他 上 炕 坐 了 ， 方问 别人 ， 又 命 人 倒 茶 。,"Then she drew him up to sit beside her on the kang and asked him about the others , at the same time giving orders for tea to be served ."
茶 未 吃 完 ， 只见 贾琮 来 问宝玉 好 。,"While they were still sipping the tea , little Jia Cong , the son of one of Jia She is concubines , came in to say ' hullo ' to his Cousin Bao ."
邢夫人 道 ： “ 那里 找 活 猴儿 去 ！ 你 那 奶妈 子 死绝 了 ！ 也 不 收拾 收拾 。 弄 的 你 黑眉乌嘴 的 ， 那里 还 象 个 大家 子 念书 的 孩子 ！ ”,"' Where did this little ragamuffin come from ? ' Lady Xing scolded . ' I do not know what that Nannie of yours can be thinking of to let you get in such a state ! I declare , your face is as black as a crow ! No one would ever think to look at you that you were an educated little boy and came from a good family ! '"
正说 着 ， 只见 贾环贾 兰小 叔侄 两个 也 来 请安 。,"While she scolded , Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived , their duty call on Jia She evidently just completed ."
邢夫人 叫 他 两 人 在 椅子 上 坐 着 。,Lady Xing made them sit on chairs below the kang .
贾环见 宝玉 同 邢夫人 坐在 一个 坐褥 上 ， 邢夫人 又 百般 摸索 抚弄 他 ， 早已 心中 不自在 了 ， 坐 不多时 ， 便 向 贾兰 使 个 眼色 儿 要 走 ， 贾兰 只得 依 他 ， 一同 起身 告辞 。,"Seeing Bao-yu up on the kang with Lady Xing and sharing her cushion , and observing how she fondled and petted him , Jia Huan soon began to feel uncomfortable and made a sign to Jia Lan indicating that they should go . As Jia Huan was his uncle , Jia Lan had to do as he said , so the little boy and the big one rose together to take their leave ."
宝玉 见 他们 起身 ， 也 就要 一同 回去 ， 邢夫人 笑 道 ： “ 你 且 坐 着 ， 我 还 和 你 说话 。 ”,"Bao-yu said he would go with them , but Lady Xing stopped him with a gracious smile : ' You sit where you are ! I have got something else to say to you . '"
宝玉 只得 坐 了 。,He was obliged to stay .
邢夫人 向 他 两个 道 ： “ 你们 回去 ， 各人 替 我 问 各人 的 母亲 好 罢 。 你 姑姑 姐姐 们 都 在 这里 呢 ， 闹 的 我 头晕 ！ — — 今儿 不留 你们 吃饭 了 。 ”,"Lady Xing turned to the other two : ' When you get back , do each of you give my regards to your mothers . I will not ask you to stay to dinner because I have already got the girls here and they are making so much rumpus that it is given me a headache . '"
贾环 等 答应 着 便 出去 了 。,Jia Huan and Jia Lan promised to convey her greetings and went out .
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 可是 姐姐 们 都 过来 了 ？ 怎么 不见 ？ ”,"' Where are the girls , then ? ' Bao-yu asked after they had gone . ' I haven ' t seen them . '"
邢夫人 道 ： “ 他们 坐 了 会子 ， 都 往后 头 不知 那 屋里 去 了 。 ”,"' Oh , I do not know , ' said Lady Xing nonchalantly . ' They only sat here for a few moments , then they went round to the back . They are round the back somewhere or other . '"
宝玉 说 ： “ 大娘 说 ‘ 有 话 说 ’ ， 不知 是 什么 话 ？ ”,"' You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about , Aunt . What was it you wanted to tell me ? '"
邢夫人 笑 道 ： “ 那里 什么 话 ， 不过 叫 你 等 着 同 姐妹 们 吃了饭 去 ， 还有 一个 好玩 的 东西 给 你 带回去 玩儿 。 ”,"' Oh , nothing at all ! ' said Lady Xing gaily . ' I only said that because I wanted you to stay and have dinner here with me and the girls . And I have got something nice for you to take back with you afterwards . '"
娘儿 两个 说 着 ， 不觉 又 晚饭 时候 ， 请 过 众位 姑娘 们 来 ， 调 开 桌椅 ， 罗列 杯盘 ， 母女 姊妹 们 吃毕 了 饭 ， 宝玉 辞别 贾 赦 ， 同众 妹妹 们 回家 ， 见 过 贾母王 夫人 等 ， 各自 回房 安歇 ， 不在话下 。,"Bao-yu and his aunt chatted away , and before long it was time for dinner and the three girls were called in . A table and chairs were arranged , the table was laid , and Lady Xing , her daughter Ying-chun , her two nieces and her nephew sat down to their meal . When it was over , Bao-yu went in to take his leave of Jia She , after which he and the girls returned to their own side of the mansion . There they first went in to see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then returned to their own apartments for the night . So much for Bao-yu and the girls ."
且说 贾芸 进去 ， 见 了 贾琏 ， 因 打听 ： “ 可 有 什么 事情 ？ ”,"Let us return to Jia Yun who , after his encounter with Bao-yu , had gone in to see Jia Lian and ask him if there was any prospect of a job ."
贾琏 告诉 他 说 ： “ 前儿 倒 有 一件 事情 出来 ， 偏偏 你 婶娘 再三 求 了 我 ， 给 了 芹儿 了 。,"A job turned up only the other day , ' said Jia Lian , but unfortunately your Aunt Feng was very anxious that I should give it to Jia Qin and I am afraid I let him have it ."
他 许 我 说 ： ‘ 明儿 园里 还有 几处 要 栽 花木 的 地方 ， 等 这个 工程 出来 ， 一定 给 你 就是 了 。 ’ ”,"However , she did mention that there will soon be a lot of planting to do in the garden , and she promised that as soon as that work turns up we shall definitely hand it over to you . '"
那 贾芸 听 了 ， 半晌 说道 ： “ 既 这么着 ， 我 就 等 着 罢 。,"Jia Yun was silent for some moments , then he said : ' All right . I will just have to go on waiting , then ."
叔叔 也 不必 先 在 婶娘 跟 前提 我 今儿 来 打听 的话 ， 到 跟前 再说 也 不迟 。 ”,"But would you mind not mentioning this visit to Auntie ? I can tell her about it myself , if need be , next time I see her . '"
贾琏 道 ： “ 提 他 做 什么 ！ 我 那里 有 这 工夫 说闲话 呢 ？,"' I shall not mention it , ' said Jia Lian . ' I have got better things to do with my time than go running after her to talk about things like this !"
明日 还要 到 兴 邑 去 走 一 走 ， 必须 当日 赶回来 方好 。 你 先 等 着 去 。 后日 起 更 以后 ， 你 来 讨信 ， 早 了 我 不得闲 。 ”,"Tomorrow I have to go to Xing-yi , by the way . I have to get back on the same day - but perhaps you would better wait until the day after tomorrow before coming round again . In fact , you would better wait until the evening of the day after tomorrow - some time after the beginning of the first watch . Any time before that I shall be busy . '"
说 着 ， 便 向 后面 换衣服 去 了 。,He terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes .
贾芸 出 了 荣国府 回家 ， 一路 思量 ， 想 出 一个 主意 来 ， 便 一径往 他 舅舅 卜世仁 家 来 。,"Jia Yun went out of the Rong-guo mansion and set off for home , ruminating as he went . A plan at last formed in his mind . Instead of returning home , he struck off for the house of his maternal uncle ."
原来 卜世仁 现开 香料 铺 ， 方才 从 铺子 里 回来 ， 一 见 贾芸 ， 便 问 ： “ 你 做 什么 来 了 ？ ”,"His uncle 's name was Bu Shi-ren . He was the proprietor of a perfumery , and when Jia Yun arrived had only just got back from the shop . Seeing his nephew enter , he asked him what he had come about ."
贾芸道 ： “ 有件事 求 舅舅 帮衬 ： 要 用 冰片 、 麝香 ， 好歹 舅舅 每样 赊 四两 给 我 ， 八月节 按 数 送 了 银子 来 。 ”,"' I am on to something which needs your help , ' said Jia Yun . ' Please Uncle , could you possibly let me have four ounces of Barus camphor and four ounces of musk on credit ? I promise faithfully that you shall have the money by Autumn Quarter-day . '"
卜世仁 冷笑 道 ： “ 再 休 提 赊欠 一事 ！,Bu Shi-ren ' humphed ' scornfully : ' Do not talk to me about credit !
前日 也 是 我们 铺子 里 一个 伙计 ， 替 他 的 亲戚 赊 了 几两 银子 的 货 ， 至今 总 没 还 ， 因此 我们 大家 赔 上 ， 立 了 合同 ， 再 不许 替 亲友 赊欠 ， 谁 要犯 了 ， 就 罚 他 二十两 银子 的 东道 。,"A while ago we let one of the assistants have several taels ' worth of goods on credit for one of his relations , and we haven ' t seen the money for it yet . We had to share the loss between us . We have got a written agreement now that in future if any of us gives credit to a friend or relation , he is liable to a fine of twenty taels of silver to be shared out among the rest ."
况且 如今 这个 货 也 短 ， 你 就 拿现 银子 到 我们 这 小铺子 里来 买 ， 也 还 没有 这些 ， 只好 倒 扁 儿 去 ， 这 是 一件 。,"' In any case , we are short of stock on those two items . I doubt we have got that much in the shop , even if you could pay cash down for it . We would have to try to raise it for you elsewhere ."
二则 你 那里 有 正经事 ？ 不过 赊 了 去 又 是 胡闹 。,"And for another thing : what do you want it for , anyway ? I do not expect it is for any serious purpose . Even if I let you have it on credit , I expect it would only get thrown away on some foolishness or other ."
你 只 说 舅舅 见 你 一遭 儿 就 派 你 一遭 儿 不是 ， 你 小人儿 家 很 不知好歹 ， 也 要 立个 主意 ， 赚 几个 钱 ， 弄弄 穿 的 吃 的 ， 我 看着 也 喜欢 。 ”,"' And do not you go saying that your Uncle 's always on at you when you come to see him ! You young people just do not know what is good for you . If only you could pull yourself together and earn a bit of money , no one would be happier for you than I should . '"
贾芸笑 道 ： “ 舅舅 说 的 有理 。,"Jia Yun smiled : ' What you say is no doubt perfectly true , Uncle ."
但 我 父亲 没 的 时候 儿 ， 我 又 小 ， 不知 事体 。 后来 听见 母亲 说 ， 都 还 亏了 舅舅 替 我们 出 主意 料理 的 丧事 。,"But when Father died I was too little to understand what was going on , and according to what Mother has since told me , it was you who stepped in and took care of everything ."
难道 舅舅 是 不 知道 的 ： 还是 有 一亩 地 、 两间 房子 ， 在 我 手里 花 了 不成 ？,"Now you know as well as I do that it was not I who spent all the money that came from selling off our little bit of property , and I do not see what I am supposed to do without any capital ."
‘ 巧 媳妇 做 不 出没 米 的 饭 来 ’ ， 叫 我 怎么样 呢 ？,Even the cleverest housewife can not make bread without flour !
— — 还 亏 是 我 呢 ！,You are lucky you have only got me to contend with .
要是 别的 ， 死皮赖脸 的 三日 两 头儿 来 缠 舅舅 ， 要 三升 米 二 升 豆子 ， 舅舅 也 就 没法儿 呢 ！ ”,"Anyone else in my position would be pestering the life out of you . They would be round here scrounging all the time : a pound of rice one day , a quart of beans the next . Then you would have something to grumble about ! '"
卜世仁 道 ： “ 我 的 儿 ， 舅舅 要 有 ， 还 不是 该当 的 ？,"' My dear boy , ' said Bu Shi-ren , ' if I had it to give , you should have it and welcome !"
我 天天 和 你 舅母 说 ， 只 愁 你 没 个 算计 儿 。,"Your trouble is , though , as I am always telling your Aunt , you will not think ahead ."
你 但凡 立 的 起来 ， 到 你们 大屋里 ， 就是 他们 爷儿们 见不着 ， 下 个 气儿 和 他们 的 管事 的 爷们 嬉 和 嬉 和 ， 也 弄 个 事儿 管管 。,"If only you would pull yourself together and go and have a word with your Father 's folk at the big house - or if you can not get to see them , put your pride in your pocket and make yourself agreeable to some of the stewards there - get yourself a job of some kind !"
前儿 我 出 城 去 ， 碰见 你们 三 屋里 的 老四 ， 〈 骑 着 大 叫驴 〉 ， 又 带 着 四 五辆车 ， 有 四五十 小 和尚 道士 儿 ， 往 家庙 里 去 了 。,"When I was on my way out of the city the other day , I ran into that cousin of yours from North Street riding on a donkey with four or five carriages behind him and fifty or sixty nuns on his way to your family temple out in the country ."
他 那 不 亏 能干 ， 就 有 这个 事 到 他 身上 了 ？ ”,Now that is a shrewd young fellow ! You can not tell me he got that job by doing nothing ! '
贾芸 听 了 唠叨 的 不堪 ， 便 起身 告辞 。,"Exasperated by his uncle 's nagging , Jia Yun got up to go ."
卜世仁 道 ： “ 怎么 这么 忙 ？ 你 吃了饭 去 罢 — — ”,' What is the hurry ? ' said Bu Shi-ren . ' You can have something to eat before you go - '
一句 话 尚未 说完 ， 只见 他 娘子 说道 ： “ 你 又 糊涂 了 ！ 说 着 没有 米 ， 这里 买 了 半斤 面来 下 给 你 吃 ， 这 会子 还 装 胖 呢 。 留下 外甥 挨饿 不成 ？ ”,"' Are you crazy ? ' his wife 's voice cut in from the kitchen . ' I told you we haven ' t got any rice in the house . I have just bought this half a pound of noodles that I am cooking for you now . I do not know what you are acting so lordly about , asking people to dinner . The boy will only go hungry if he stays ! '"
卜世仁 道 ： “ 再 买 半斤 来 添 上 就是 了 。 ”,"' Buy another half a pound , woman , and put it in with the rest ! ' said Bu Shi-ren ."
他 娘子 便 叫 女儿 ： “ 银姐 ， 往 对门 王奶奶 家 去 问 ： 有钱 借 几十个 ， 明儿 就 送 了 来 的 。 ”,' Goldie ! ' Mrs Bu shouted to her daughter . ' Go over to Mrs Wang 's house across the road and ask if she can lend us a few cash . Tell her we can pay her back tomorrow ! '
夫妻 两个 说话 ， 那 贾芸早 说 了 几个 “ 不用 费事 ” ， 去 的 无影无踪 了 。,"But before she had finished , Jia Yun , with a muttered ' Do not bother ! ' had slipped quietly away ."
不言卜家 夫妇 ， 且说 贾芸 赌气 离 了 舅舅 家门 ， 一 径 回来 ， 心下 正自 烦恼 ， 一边 想 ， 一边 走 ， 低着头 ， 不想 一头 就 碰 在 一个 醉汉 身上 ， 把 贾芸 一把 拉 住 ， 骂 道 ： “ 你 瞎了眼 ？ 碰起 我 来 了 ！ ”,"Angrily leaving his uncle 's house behind him , he was on his way back home , eyes fixed on the ground as he brooded miserably on his affairs , when he walked head-on into a drunkard . The man seized hold of him with a curse : ' You sodding blind , bumping into me like that ? '"
贾芸 听 声音 象是 熟人 ， 仔细 一 看 ， 原来 是 紧邻 倪二 。 这 倪二 是 个 泼皮 ， 专放 重利 债 ， 在 赌博 场 吃饭 ， 专爱 喝酒 打架 。,"The voice was a familiar one . Looking closer he saw that it was his neighbour Ni Er , a racketeer who made most of his money from high-interest loans supplemented by what he took off other players in the gambling dens . He drank too much and was always getting into fights ."
此时 正 从 欠钱 人家 索债 归来 ， 已 在 醉乡 ， 不料 贾芸 碰 了 他 ， 就要 动手 。 贾芸 叫 道 ： “ 老二 ， 住手 ！ 是 我 冲撞 了 你 。 ”,"At this particular moment he was on his way back from paying a little call ' on one of his debtors - evidently a lucrative one , for he was already half-seas-over . He did not take kindly to being bumped into , and it would have gone badly with Jia Yun if he had not immediately identified himself : ' Ni , old chap , do not strike ! It is me ! I was not looking where I was going . '"
倪二一 听 他 的 语音 ， 将 醉眼 睁开 ， 一 看见 是 贾芸 ， 忙松 了 手 ， 趔趄 着 笑 道 ： “ 原来 是 贾二爷 ！ 这 会子 那里 去 ？ ”,"Hearing the voice , Ni Er opened his bleary eyes a little wider , saw that it was Jia Yun , released him - lurching heavily as he did so - and gave a crapulous laugh : ' Oh , ' he said , ' young Mist Jia . Parm me . Wherra you jus ' come from ? '"
贾芸道 ： “ 告诉 不得 你 ； 平白 的 又 讨 了 个 没趣儿 。 ”,' Do not ask me ! ' said Jia Yun bitterly . ' I have just been given the bird ! '
倪 二道 ： “ 不妨 。,' Nemmind ! ' said Ni Er.
有 什么 不平 的 事 ， 告诉 我 ， 我 替 你 出气 。,"' Anyone been bothering you , Mist ' Jia , jus ' tell me and I will settle accounts with him for you !"
这 三街六巷 ， 凭 他 是 谁 ， 若 得罪 了 我 醉金刚 倪二 的 街坊 ， 管 叫 他人 离家 散 ！ ”,"You know me . Ni Er. The Drunken Diamond . Old Dime will look after you . Anyone this part of the town troubling neighbour of Dime 's , do not care who he is , guarantee put him out of business . '"
贾芸道 ： “ 老二 ， 你 别生气 ， 听 我 告诉 你 这 缘故 。 ” 便 把 卜世仁 一段 事 告诉 了 倪二 。,"' Look , Diamond , if you will promise not to get angry , I will tell you what happened , ' said Jia Yun , and proceeded to give him an account of his interview with Bu Shi-ren ."
倪二 听 了 大 怒 道 ： “ 要不是 二爷 的 亲戚 ， 我 就 骂 出来 。 真真 把 人 气死 ！,Ni Er was hugely incensed : ' Damn fella ! Give the damn fella piece of my mind if he was not a relation of yours . Make my blood boil . Damn fella !
— — 也罢 ， 你 也 不必 愁 ， 我 这里 现有 几两 银子 ， 你 要 用 只管 拿 去 。,"Nemmind . Dome be downhearted . Got a few taels of silver here . If you can use it , help yourself !"
我们 好 街坊 ， 这 银子 是 不要 利钱 的 。 ”,Good neighbour of Dime 's . Here y ' are . Interest-free loan . '
［ 一头 说 ， 一头 从 搭包 内 掏出 一包 银子 来 。 ］,
贾芸 心下 自思 ： “ 倪二 素日 虽然 是 泼皮 ， 却 也 因 人 而 施 ， 颇 有 义侠 之 名 。,"' This man 's a racketeer , ' Jia Yun thought to himself , but he is been known to do a good turn before now - in fact , he is got quite a reputation in some quarters as a champion of the poor ."
若 今日 不领 他 这 情 ， 怕 他 臊 了 ， 反为 不美 。,"If I do not accept his offer , he may turn nasty and I shall be in trouble ."
不如 用 了 他 的 ， 改日 加倍 还 他 就是 了 。 ”,Better accept the money and pay back double the amount when I can . '
因 笑 道 ： “ 老二 ， 你 果然 是 个 好汉 ！,"Having made the decision , he thanked Ni Er with a smile : ' You are a real sport , Diamond !"
既 蒙 高 情 ， 怎敢 不 领 ？,"Since you have been kind enough to make the offer then , I will not refuse ."
回家 就 照例 写 了 文约 送过来 。 ”,I will make you out a proper IOU for it when I get home . '
倪二 大笑 道 ： “ 这 不过 是 十五两三 钱 银子 ， 你 若 要写 文约 ， 我 就 不 借 了 。 ”,"Ni Er roared with laughter : ' There is only fifteen taels and six pennyweights of silver here . If you are going to go writing IOUs , I will not lend it to you ! '"
贾芸 听 了 ， 一面 接 银子 ， 一面 笑 道 ： “ 我 遵命 就是 了 。 何必 着急 ！ ”,"Jia Yun laughed too and took the money from him : ' All right , Diamond , anything you say ! Let's not fall out about it ! '"
倪二笑 道 ： “ 这 才 是 呢 ！ 天气 黑 了 ， 也 不让 你 喝酒 了 ， 我 还 有点 事儿 ， 你 竟 请 回 罢 。,' That is more like it ! ' said Ni Er. ' Getting dark now . Will not keep you for a drink . Still got a little business to do . You go on home .
我 还 求 你 带 个 信儿 给 我们 家 ： 叫 他们 关了门 睡 罢 ， 我 不 回家 去 了 ； 倘或 有事 ， 叫 我们 女孩儿 明儿 一早 到 马贩子 王 短腿 家 找 我 。 ”,"Like you to give a message to my old woman , be so kind . Not going home tonight . If there is anything to tell me about , she can send my daughter round first thing tomorrow . Find me at Bandy Wang , the horse-dealer 's . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 趔趄 着 脚儿 去 了 。,"With these words he went on his way , lurching horribly ."
不在话下 。,
且说 贾芸 偶然 碰见 了 这件 事 ， 心下 也 十分 稀罕 ， 想 ： “ 那 倪二 倒 果然 有些 意思 ； 只是 怕 他 一时 醉 中 慷慨 ， 到 明日 加倍 来 要 ， 便 怎么 好 呢 ？ ”,"The encounter left Jia Yun somewhat bemused . ' That Ni Er 's certainly a character ! ' he thought . ' The trouble is , it may only have been the drink that made him generous . Perhaps when he is sobered up tomorrow he will want his money back with a hundred per cent interest . What am I going to do then ? '"
忽 又 想 道 ： “ 不妨 ， 等 那件事 成 了 ， 可 也 加倍 还 的 起 他 。 ”,"Then he suddenly remembered what the money would enable him to do : ' Of course ! It does not matter ! If I get the job , I can pay back the loan and a hundred per cent interest easily . '"
因 走到 一个 钱 铺 里 ， 将 那 银子 称 了 称 ， 分 两 不错 ， 心上 越发 喜欢 。,"With that thought uppermost in his mind he went into a money-changer 's to have the silver weighed . To his great delight it turned out to be exactly the amount Ni Er had said , not a pennyweight less ."
到 家 先 将 倪二 的话 捎 给 他 娘子 儿 ， 方 回家 来 。,"Then he went home , calling at Ni Er 's house on the way to give the message to his wife ."
他 母亲 正在 炕 上 拈线 ， 见 他 进来 ， 便 问 ： “ 那里 去 了 一天 ？ ”,Entering his own house he found his mother on the kang spinning . She looked up as he entered : ' Where have you been all day ? '
贾芸恐 母亲 生气 ， 便 不 提 卜世仁 的 事 ， 只 说 ： “ 在 西府里 等 琏 二叔 来 着 。 ” 问 他 母亲 ： “ 吃了饭 了 没有 ？ ”,He did not like to mention that he had been to see her brother in case she was angry . He only said : ' Been at Rong-guo House waiting for Uncle Lian . Have you had supper yet ? '
他 母亲 说 ： “ 吃 了 。 还 留 着 饭 在 那里 。 ”,"' Yes , I have had mine . I put something aside for you . '"
叫 小丫头 拿来 给 他 吃 。,She called to their little slavey to fetch it for him .
那天 已 是 掌灯 时候 ， 贾芸 吃了饭 ， 收拾 安歇 ， 一 宿 无 话 。,"Except for her work-lamp it was already dark indoors , so after finishing his supper he got himself ready for the night , unrolled his bedding , and settled down to sleep ."
次日 起来 ， 洗 了 脸 ， 便 出 南门 大街 ， 在 香铺 买 了 冰 麝 ， 往 荣府 来 。,"Rising early next morning , he went off as soon as he had washed to the shops in Central Street outside the south gate of the Inner City and bought camphor and musk at a perfumer 's ."
打听 贾琏 出了门 ， 贾芸 便 往后面 来 。,"From there he went to Rong-guo House , and having first ascertained at the gate that Jia Lian was out for the day , he made his way to the Lians ' apartment at the back ."
到 贾琏 院门 前 ， 只见 几个 小厮 ， 拿 着 大 高 的 苕帚 在 那里 扫 院子 呢 。,Outside the gateway leading to their courtyard a number of page boys were sweeping the ground with long-handled brooms .
忽 见 周瑞家 的 从 门里 出来 叫 小厮 们 ： “ 先别 扫 ， 奶奶 出来 了 。 ”,Suddenly Zhou Rui 's wife came out and addressed them : ' Stop sweeping now ! The Mistress is coming . '
贾芸忙 上去 笑 问道 ： “ 二 婶娘 那里 去 ？ ”,"Jia Yun hurried up to her with a smile of greeting : ' Where is Aunt Lian off to , then ? '"
周瑞家 的 道 ： “ 老太太 叫 ， 想必 是 裁 什么 尺头 。 ”,"' Her Old Ladyship wants her , ' said Zhou Rui 's wife . ' I think it is to see about some tailoring ."
正说 着 ， 只见 一群 人 簇拥着 凤姐 出来 了 。,"As she spoke , the subject of his inquiry emerged from the gateway , surrounded by a bevy of attendants ."
贾芸 深知 凤姐 是 喜 奉承 爱 排场 的 ， 忙 把手 逼 着 ， 恭恭敬敬 抢 上来 请安 。,"Jia Yun was well aware that she had a weakness for flattery and the showier forms of deference . Bringing his hands together in an exaggerated salute and stepping briskly forward , he made her a tremendous bow and wished her in good health ."
凤姐 连正眼 也 不 看 ， 仍 往前走 ， 只 问 他 母亲 好 ： “ 怎么 不 来 这里 逛逛 ？ ”,"Xi-feng continued to walk on and , without actually looking at him or turning her head , inquired after his mother 's health and asked why she never came to visit ."
贾芸道 ： “ 只是 身上 不好 ， 倒 时常 惦记着 坤娘 ， 要 瞧瞧 ， 总 不能 来 。 ”,"' She is not been very well , Auntie . She is always thinking about you and meaning to pay a call , but when it is come to it , she just hasn ' t been able to get out . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 可是 你 会 撒谎 ！ 不是 我 提 ， 他 也 就 不想 我 了 。 ”,' You are a wonderful liar ! ' said Xi-feng with a laugh . ' I do not suppose she is ever thought about me until this moment ! '
贾芸笑 道 ： “ 侄儿 不怕 雷劈 ， 就敢 在 长辈 儿 跟前 撒谎 了 ？,"' I am too much afraid of lightning to lie to my superiors , ' said Jia Yun ."
昨儿 晚上 还 提起 婶娘 来 ， 说 ： ‘ 婶娘 身子 单弱 ， 事情 又 多 ， 亏了 婶娘 好 精神 ， 竟 料理 的 周 周全 全 的 。 要是 差一点儿 的 ， 早 累 的 不知 怎么样 了 。 ’ ”,"' Mother was talking about you only last night , as a matter of fact . She said , "" Your Auntie Lian is only a single weak woman , yet she has all those responsibilities . It is a good thing she has the willpower to keep everything running so smoothly , because if that should go , she would be worn out in no time . "" '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 满脸 是 笑 ， 由不的止 了 步 ， 问道 ： “ 怎么 好好儿 的 ， 你们 娘儿 两个 在 背地里 嚼 说起 我 来 ？ ”,"Xi-feng was now all smiles , and halted in spite of herself to hear more . ' And why should you and your mother be chewing over my affairs behind my back , pray ? '"
贾芸 笑 着 道 ： “ 只 因 我 有个 好 朋友 ， 家里 有 几个 钱 ， 现开 香铺 ， 因 他 捐 了 个 通判 ， 前儿 选着 了 云南 不知 那 一府 ， 连 家眷 一齐 去 。 他 这 香铺 也 不开 了 ， 就 把 货物 攒 了 一 攒 ， 该 给 人 的 给 人 ， 该 贱发 的 贱 发 ， 象 这 贵重 的 ， 都 送给 亲友 ， 所以 我 得 了 些 冰片 、 麝香 。,"' That is a long story , ' said Jia Yun . ' A very good friend of mine who runs a perfumery and had quite a bit put by in savings decided to invest his money in a government post and bought himself the place of an Assistant Sub-Prefect . Well , a few days ago his posting came and it turns out to be for somewhere down in Yunnan . He is taking his family with him , so of course he will not be able to keep on the shop , and he is been going over all his stock deciding what to give away and what to put in his clearance sale . He decided to give the more valuable stuff to friends and relations . My share was a whole quarter of a pound of Borneo camphor and another quarter of musk , and I was discussing with Mother last night what we ought to do with it ."
我 就 和 我 母亲 商量 ： 贱卖 了 可惜 ； 要 送 人 也 没有 人家 儿 配使 这些 香料 。,"We do not know anyone who could afford to buy it ; and it seems a shame to sell it at less than the price ; and even if we gave it away , we could not think of anyone who would want so much ."
因 想到 婶娘 往 年间 还 拿 大包 的 银子 买 这些 东西 呢 ， 别说 今年 贵妃 宫中 ， 就是 这个 端阳节 所用 ， 也 一定 比 往常 要加 十几倍 ： 所以 拿来 孝敬 婶娘 。 ”,"But then I suddenly thought of you and the packets of money you have spent on this kind of thing in years past , and I thought to myself that this year , what with Her Grace in the Palace and the Double Fifth already not far off , you are sure to be using ten or twelve times the usual amount . So , to cut a long story short , we decided to make a present of it to you . There you are , Auntie - a little token of my esteem ! '"
一面 将 一个 锦匣 递过去 。,"As he spoke , he took out a small brocade-covered box and respectfully raised it in both hands to offer her ."
凤姐 正是 办 节礼 用 香料 ， 便 笑 了 一 笑 ， 命 丰儿 ： “ 接过 芸 哥儿 的 来 ， 送 了 家 去 ， 交给 平儿 。 ”,"Now Xi-feng was just beginning to think about the problem of purchasing aromatics for the Double Fifth festival , and it pleased her very much to be relieved of the trouble of doing so - especially when it was in so agreeable a manner . She smiled at him graciously before turning to her maid : ' Felicity , take my nephew 's present and give it to Patience to take care of ! '"
因 又 说道 ： “ 看 你 这么 知 好歹 ， 怪不得 你 叔叔 常 提起 你 来 ， 说 你好 ， 说话 明白 ， 心里 有 见识 。 ”,"The smile was directed once more on Jia Yun : ' You are very thoughtful . I am not surprised your Uncle Lian speaks so highly of you . He is often told me what a well-spoken , sensible young man you are . '"
贾芸 听 这话 入港 ， 便 打 进一步 来 ， 故意 问道 ： “ 原来 叔叔 也常 提 我 ？ ”,They seemed to be sailing into harbour . Jia Yun took a step closer : ' Has Uncle been talking to you about me then ? ' - The tone in which he asked the question was deliberately meaningful .
凤姐 见 问 ， 便 要 告诉 给 他 事情 管 的话 ， 一 想 ， 又 恐 他 看轻 了 ， 只 说 得 了 这点儿 香料 ， 便许 他 管事 了 。,Xi-feng was on the point of telling him that he would get the tree-planting job when she reflected that by doing so she would be cheapening herself in his estimation . He would almost certainly suppose that she was promising it in return for the perfume .
因且 把 派 他种 花木 的 事 ， 一 字 不 提 ， 随口 说 了 几句 淡话 ， 便 往 贾母 屋里 去 了 。,"In replying to his question she therefore confined herself to a few insipid civilities , avoiding all mention of jobs and trees , and presently continued on her way to Grandmother Jia 's ."
贾芸 自然 也 难 提 ， 只得 回来 。,"Obviously Jia Yun was in no position to raise the subject if his aunt was not willing , so he was obliged to return in the same uncertainty in which he had come ."
因 昨日 见 了 宝玉 ， 叫 他 到 外 书房 等 着 ， 故此 吃了饭 ， 又 进来 ， 到 贾母 那边 仪 门外 绮散斋 书房 里 来 。,"Back home he remembered Bao-yu 's invitation of the previous day , and as soon as he had finished his meal , he returned once more to Rong-guo House and made his way to Sunset Studio outside the gateway leading to Lady Jia 's quarters ."
〈 只见 焙 茗 、 锄药 两个 小厮 下象棋 ， 为 夺 “ 车 ” 正 拌嘴 ， 还有 引泉 、 扫花 、 挑 云 、 伴鹤 四五个 ， 又 在 房檐 上 掏 小 雀儿 玩 。,"He found the pages Tealeaf and Ploughboy sitting over a game of chess and arguing about a piece that one of them had just taken . Other pages - Trickles , Sweeper , Cloudy and Storky - were up on the roof looking for fledgelings ."
贾云 进入 院内 ， 把 脚 一 跺 ， 说道 ： “ 猴头 们 淘气 ， 我 来 了 。 ”,"Jia Yun entered the courtyard and stamped his foot : ' Come on , you young rapscallions ! Can not you see you have got a visitor ? '"
众 小厮 看 贾芸 进来 ， 都 才 散 了 。,"The pages , except Tealeaf , melted away ."
贾芸 进入 房 内 ， 便 坐在 椅子 上 问 ：,Jia Yun went into the study and sat down in a chair .
“ 宝二爷 没 下来 ？ ”,' Has Master Bao been here yet ? '
焙 茗 道 ： “ 今儿 总 没 下来 。,"' He hasn ' t been here yet today , ' said Tealeaf ."
二爷 说 什么 ， 我 替 你 哨探 哨探 去 。 ” ＞,"If you want to talk to him , I will have a look and see if he is about . '"
说 着 ， 便 出去 了 。,"With that he , too , vanished ."
这里 贾芸 便 看 字画 古玩 。,"For about the time it would take to eat a meal , Jia Yun gazed at the paintings , calligraphic scrolls and antiques which adorned the room ."
有 一顿饭 的 工夫 ， 还 不见 来 。 再 看看 要 找 别的 小子 ， 都 玩 去 了 。,"At the end of that time , as there was still no sign of Tealeaf , he took a look outside to see if there were any other pages whom he could ask to take a message ; but they had all gone off to play elsewhere ."
正在 烦闷 ， 只 听 门前 娇音 嫩语 的 叫 了 一声 “ 哥哥 呀 ” 。,Dejectedly he went back once more to wait . ' Tealeaf ! ' A soft and thrilling voice was calling from outside .
贾芸 往外 瞧 时 ， 是 个 十五六岁 的 丫头 ， 生 的 倒 甚 齐整 ， 两只 眼儿 水 水灵灵 的 ， 见 了 贾芸 ， 抽身 要 躲 ， 恰值 焙 茗 走来 ， 见 那丫头 在 门前 ， 便 说道 ： “ 好 ， 好 ， 正 抓 不着 个 信儿 呢 ！ ”,"Craning out to look he saw a fifteen-or sixteen-year-old maid standing near the entrance to the study . She was a neat , pleasant-looking girl with a pair of limpid , intelligent eyes . Seeing a strange man in the room , she quickly shrank back out of his line of vision . At that very moment Tealeaf walked back into the courtyard . ' Ah , good ! ' he said , catching sight of the maid . ' I was beginning to wonder how Id ever get a message to him . '"
贾芸 见 了 焙 茗 ， 也 就 赶出来 ， 问 ： “ 怎么样 ？ ”,Jia Yun ran out to question him : ' Well ? '
焙 茗 道 ： “ 等 了 半日 ， 也 没 个人 过 。 这 就是 宝二爷 屋里 的 。 ” 因 说道 ： “ 好 姑娘 ， 你 带 个 信儿 ， 就 说 廊 上 二爷 来 了 。 ”,"' Waited for ages , ' said Tealeaf , ' but no one came by . She is from his room , though ' - he indicated the soft-voiced maid - ' Listen , dear , ' he said addressing her . ' Can you take a message for us ? Tell him that Mr Jia from West Lane is here . '"
那丫头 听见 ， 方知 是 本家 的 爷们 ， 便 不似 从前 那 等 回避 ， 下死 眼 把 贾芸 钉 了 两眼 。,"On learning that the visitor was a member of the clan , the maid became less concerned about concealment and engaged the limpid eyes in bolder scrutiny of his features ."
听 那 贾芸 说道 ： “ 什么 ‘ 廊 上 ’ ‘ 廊 下 ’ 的 ， 你 只 说 芸儿 就是 了 。 ”,"The object of her scrutiny now addressed her : ' Do not bother about the "" West Lane "" stuff ! Just say that "" Yun "" has called ! '"
半晌 ， 那丫头 似 笑不笑 的 说道 ： “ 依 我 说 ， 二爷 且 请回去 ， 明日 再 来 。,"The girl reflected for some moments , then , with a half-smile , she said : ' If I were you , Mr Jia , I would go home now and come again tomorrow ."
今儿 晚上 得空儿 ， 我 替 回罢 。 ”,I will try to get a message through to him this evening if I get the chance . '
焙 茗 道 ： “ 这 是 怎么 说 ？ ”,' What is the idea ? ' said Tealeaf .
那丫头 道 ： “ 他 今儿 也 没睡 中 觉 ， 自然 吃 的 晚饭 早 ， 晚上 又 不 下来 ， 难道 只是 叫 二爷 这里 等 着 挨饿 不成 ？,"' He did not have his nap today , ' said the maid . ' That means he will be having dinner early . Then suppose he does not get back after dinner : are you going to let Mr Jia wait here all day without eating ?"
不如 家 去 ， 明儿 来 是 正经 。,It would be much better if he went home now and came again tomorrow .
— — 就 便 回来 有人 带 信儿 ， 也 不过 嘴里 答应 着罢 咧 。 ”,"Even if presently someone agrees to take message to him for you , they maybe just saying they will and not do it . '"
贾芸 听 这 丫头 的话 ， 简便 俏丽 ， 待 要 问 他 的 名字 ， 因是 宝玉 屋里 的 ， 又 不便 问 ， 只得 说道 ： “ 这话 倒 是 。 我 明日 再 来 。 ”,"Her words were sensible and to the point and were spoken in the same thrilling tone that had first attracted him . Jia Yun would have liked to ask her name , but etiquette forbade that he should do so now that he knew she was one of Bao-yu 's maids . He just said : ' I am sure you are right . I will come again tomorrow , then . '"
说 着 ， 便 往外 去 了 。,He turned to go .
焙 茗 道 ： “ 我 倒 茶 去 。 二爷 喝 了 茶 再 去 。 ”,"' I will get some tea for you , Mr Jia , ' said Tealeaf . ' Have a cup of tea before you go . '"
贾芸 一面 走 ， 一面 回头 说 ： “ 不用 ， 我 还有 事 呢 。 ”,"' No thanks , ' said Jia Yun , looking back over his shoulder but continuing to go . ' I have got other business . '"
口里 说话 ， 眼睛 瞧 那丫头 还 站 在 那里 呢 。,"The words were for Tealeaf , but the look whichaccompanied them was directed at the soft-voiced maid , who was still standing there ."
那 贾芸 一径 回来 。 至 次日 ， 来 至 大 门前 ， 可巧 遇见 凤姐 往 那边 去 请安 ， 才 上 了 车 ， 见 贾芸 过来 ， 便 命 人 叫住 ， 隔 着 窗子 笑 道 ： “ 芸儿 ， 你 竟 有 胆子 在 我 跟前 弄鬼 ！,"Jia Yun went back home and returned next day as she had advised . On his way in he ran into Xi-feng outside the main gate . She was about to visit Jia Lian 's parents next door and had just got into her carriage . Seeing Jia Yun , she made her attendants call to him to stop ."
怪 道 你 送 东西 给 我 ， 原来 你 有事 求 我 。,"' Yun ! ' She smiled at him through the window of the carriage . ' You have got a nerve , my lad , playing a trick like that on me !"
昨儿 你 叔叔 才 告诉 我 ， 说 你 求 他 。 ”,I see now why you gave me that present . It is a job you were after . Your Uncle told me yesterday . Apparently you have been on to him about it already . '
贾芸笑 道 ： “ 求 叔叔 的 事 ， 婶娘 别提 ， 我 这里 正 后悔 呢 。,"Jia Yun smiled back ruefully : ' I would rather we did not go into my dealings with Uncle , if you do not mind ! I am beginning to wish I would never spoken to him about it ."
早知 这样 ， 我 一起 头儿 就 求 婶娘 ， 这 会子 早 完 了 ， 谁 承望 叔叔 竟 不能 的 ！ ”,"If I would realized earlier what the situation was , I should have gone straight to you in the first place . I am sure if I had , it would all have been settled long ago . I am afraid Uncle has let me down . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 哦 ！,' Humph ! ' said Xi-feng .
你 那边 没成 儿 ， 昨儿 又 来 找 我 了 ？ ”,"' So that is why you came to me yesterday , is it ? You would had no success with the husband so you thought you would try your luck with the wife ! '"
贾芸道 ： “ 婶娘 辜负 了 我 的 孝心 。,"' That is most unfair , Auntie ! ' Jia Yun protested ."
我 并 没有 这个 意思 ； 要 有 这个 意思 ， 昨儿 还 不求 婶娘 吗 ？,"It was a purely disinterested present . I was not thinking at all about a job when I gave it to you . If I had been , why do you suppose I did not take the opportunity of asking you about it at the time ?"
如今 婶娘 既 知道 了 ， 我 倒 要 把 叔叔 搁开 ， 少不得 求 婶娘 ， 好歹 疼 我 一点儿 。 ”,"However , since you do now know that I am looking for one , I would like to forget about Uncle and throw myself on your kindness instead . '"
凤姐 冷笑 道 ： “ 你们 要 拣 远道 儿 走 么 ！,"' You have a very devious way of going about things , ' said Xi-feng with a hint of malice in her smile ."
早 告诉 我 一声 儿 ， 多 大 点子 事 ， 还 值得 耽误到 这 会子 ！,Why could not you have spoken up sooner ? A little thing like this is hardly worth so much delay .
那 园子 里 还要 种 树种 花儿 ， 我 正 想 个人 呢 。,"We still need some more trees and shrubs planted in the garden , and I have been trying to think of someone to do the job ."
早 说 不早 完 了 ？ ”,"If you would spoken up earlier , it could all have been done by now . '"
贾芸笑 道 ： “ 这样 明日 婶娘 就 派 我 罢 。 ”,"' You can set me to work tomorrow , Auntie . I will be ready . '"
凤姐 半晌道 ： “ 这个 我 看着 不大好 ， 等 明年 正月 里 的 烟火 灯烛 那个 大宗 儿 下来 ， 再 派 你 不好 ？ ”,Xi-feng thought for a while . ' I do not know that it is a very suitable job for you . Perhaps we would better wait until next New Year and put you in charge of lanterns and fireworks . That is a much bigger job . '
贾芸道 ： “ 好 婶娘 ， 先 把 这个 派 了 我 ， 果然 这件 办 的 好 ， 再 派 我 那件 罢 。 ”,"' Look , Auntie : you give me this planting job now , then ; if you are satisfied with the way I do it , you can give me the other job later on . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 倒 会 拉 长线 儿 ！ — — 罢了 ， 要不是 你 叔叔 说 ， 我 不管 你 的 事 。 我 不过 吃了饭 就 过来 ， 你 到 午 错 时候 来领 银子 ， 后日 就 进去 种 花儿 。 ”,"Xi-feng laughed : ' You certainly know how to fish with a long line ! - All right , then ! It is not really my affair , but I suppose as your Uncle has mentioned it to me - I am only going next door now and I shall be back again after lunch . Come round a little after midday to get the money and you shall start your planting the day after tomorrow :"
说 着 ， 命人 驾起 香车 ， 径 去 了 。,She told the servants to harness the carriage and drove off to make her call .
贾芸 喜不自禁 。 来 至 绮散 斋 打听 宝玉 ， 谁知 宝玉 一早 便 往 北静王 府 里 去 了 。 贾芸 便 呆呆 的 坐到 晌午 ， 打听 凤姐 回来 ， 去 写 个 领票 来领 对 牌 ， 至 院外 ， 命人 通报 了 ， 彩明 走 出来 ， 要 了 领票 进去 ， 批 了 银数 、 年 月 ， 一并 连对 牌 交给 贾芸 。,"Beside himself with joy , Jia Yun now continued on his way to Sunset Studio to look for Bao-yu . In point of fact Bao-yu had gone off first thing that morning to call on the Prince of Bei-jing ; but no one seemed to know about this , and Jia Yun sat waiting expectantly throughout the whole of the morning . Having waited until noon , he inquired whether Xi-feng was back yet , and being informed that she was , he wrote out a form of receipt , took it round to the Lians ' apartment , and sent in word that he had called for his tally . Sunshine came out in response to his message and asked him for the receipt , which he took indoors . Presently he reappeared and handed it back to Jia Yun with the date and amount filled in in the blanks he had left for this purpose , together with the precious tally which would enable him to draw the money ."
贾芸 接 来看 那 批 上 批着 二百两 银子 ， 心中 喜悦 ， 翻身 走 到 银库 上领 了 银子 ， 回家 告诉 他 母亲 ， 自 是 母子 俱 喜 。,"Glancing at the receipt as he took it from him , Jia Yun was delighted to observe that the figures entered were for a payment of two hundred taels of silver . He hurried off to the counting-house to collect it , then home once more to share the joyful news with his mother ."
次日 五更 ， 贾芸先 找 了 倪二 还 了 银子 ， 又 拿 了 五十两 银子 ， 出 西门 找到 花儿匠 方椿 家里 去 买 树 ， 不在话下 。,"Next day he was off long before daylight to look up Ni Er and pay him back the loan . That done , he took another fifty taels of the silver with him and called on a nurseryman outside the West Gate called Fang Chun , from whom he bought a large number of trees . At this point our narrative abandons Jia Yun 's affairs and returns to Bao-yu ."
且说 宝玉 自 这 日见 了 贾芸 ， 曾 说 过 明日 着 他 进来 说话 ， 这 原是 富贵 公子 的 口角 ， 那里 还 记 在 心上 ， 因而 便 忘怀 了 。,"When Bao-yu , in the course of his meeting with Jia Yun , had invited Jia Yun to drop in and spend the following day with him , the invitation was of the careless , half-serious kind that is unfortunately typical of young gentlemen of his class . As he had made no real effort to remember it at the time , it naturally slipped his memory the following day ."
这日 晚上 ， 却 从 北静王 府 里 回来 ， 见 过 贾母王 夫人 等 ， 回至 园内 ， 换 了 衣服 ， 正要 洗澡 ， — — 袭 人 被 宝钗 烦 了 去 打结 子 去 了 ； 秋纹 碧痕 两个 去 催水 ， ｛ 晴雯 因 他 表哥 生日 接 了 出去 ； ｝ 麝月 现在 家中 病 着 ； 还有 几个 做 粗活 听 使唤 的 丫头 ， 料 是 叫 不着 他 ， 都 出去 寻伙 觅伴 的 去 了 。,"Returning now , two evenings later , from the palace of the Prince of Bei-jing where he had been all day , he called first on his grandmother and his mother and then returned to his own rooms in the garden and changed back into his everyday clothes . He decided to take a bath ; and since Aroma was out , having been ' borrowed ' by Bao-chai to do some kind of knot-work for her , Ripple and Emerald had gone off to see about the water . Of the other senior maids , Skybright had been fetched home for her cousin 's birthday and Musk was away ill ; and the few heavy-work maids left in attendance had all assumed that their services would not be required and had gone off in search of their gossips ."
不想 这 一刻 的 工夫 ， 只 剩 了 宝玉 在 屋内 ， 偏偏 的 宝玉 要 喝茶 ， 一连 叫 了 两三声 ， 方见 两三个 老婆子 走进 来 。,For a quarter of an hour Bao-yu was left entirely on his own . It chanced that precisely at this moment he wanted someone to get him some tea . He had already called a couple of times without response and at his third call two or three old charwomen came hurrying in to see what was the matter .
宝玉 见 了 ， 连忙 摇手 说 ： “ 罢 ， 罢 ！ 不用 了 。 ”,"' No , no : I do not need you ! ' - he waved them away impatiently ."
老婆子 们 只得 退出 。,"The old women retired , baffled ."
宝玉 见 没 丫头 们 ， 只得 自己 下来 ， 拿 了 碗 ， 向 茶壶 去 倒 茶 。 只 听 背后 有人 说道 ： “ 二爷 ， 看 烫 了 手 ， 等 我 倒 罢 。 ”,"Since there were no maids , Bao-yu saw that he would have to serve himself . He found himself a cup and was about to take up the pot to pour himself some tea when a voice started speaking right behind him : ' Let me , Master Bao ! You might scald yourself . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 走上 来接 了 碗 去 。 宝玉 倒 唬 了 一 跳 ， 问 ： “ 你 在 那里 来 着 ？ 忽然 来 了 ， 唬 了 我一 跳 ！ ”,"Bao-yu jumped . The owner of the voice hurriedly relieved him of the cup . ' Where have you been all this time ? ' he said . ' You gave me quite a start , coming up suddenly like that ! '"
那丫头 一面 递 茶 ， 一面 笑 着 回道 ： “ 我 在 后 院里 。 才 从 里间 后门 进来 ， 难道 二爷 就 没 听见 脚步 响么 ？ ”,She handed him his tea with a smile : ' I was in the back courtyard . I came in through the courtyard door at the back . Did not you hear me coming ? '
宝玉 一面 吃 茶 ， 一面 仔细 打量 ， 那丫头 穿着 几件 半新不旧 的 衣裳 ， 倒 是 一头 黑鸦 鸦的 好 头发 ， 挽 着 鬟 儿 ， 容长 脸面 ， 细挑 身材 ， 却 十分 俏丽 甜净 。,"Bao-yu sipped his tea and observed her carefully . Her dress , though not shabby , was far from new . By contrast she had a magnificent head of raven-black hair which was done up in a simple bun . The face was rather long and thin ; the build slender ; the overall impression that of a tidy , clean , graceful person ."
宝玉 便 笑 问道 ： “ 你 也 是 我 屋里 的 人 么 ？ ”,' Do you belong here then ? ' he asked her .
那丫头 笑 应道 ： “ 是 。 ”,' Yes . ' She seemed amused .
宝玉 道 ： “ 既是 这 屋里 的 ， 我 怎么 不 认得 ？ ”,"' If you do , how is it that I have never seen you before ? '"
那丫头 听说 ， 便 冷笑 一声 道 ： “ 爷 不 认得 的 也 多 呢 ！ 岂止 我 一个 ！,"She replied with some bitterness : ' There are quite a few of us you have never seen . I am not the only one , by any means ."
从来 我 又 不递 茶水 拿 东西 ， 眼面前 儿 的 一件 也 做 不着 ， 那里 认得 呢 ？ ”,How could you have seen me ? I have never been allowed to wait on you or show myself in your presence . '
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 为什么 不 做 眼面前 儿 的 呢 ？ ”,' Why not ? '
那丫头 道 ： “ 这话 我 也 难说 。,' I do not think it is for me to say .
— — 只是 有 句 话 回 二爷 ： 昨日 有个 什么 芸儿 来 找 二爷 ， 我 想 二爷 不 得空儿 ， 便 叫 焙 茗 回 他 ； 今日 来 了 ， 不想 二爷 又 往 北府 里 去 了 。 … … ”,"- Oh , there is something I do have to tell you , though . Yesterday a gentleman calling himself "" Yun "" came to see you . I thought you probably would not be able to see him at the time , so I told Tealeaf to ask him round this morning . Unfortunately by the time he came , you would already gone off to see the Prince - '"
刚 说 到 这 句 话 ， 只见 秋纹 碧痕 嘻嘻哈哈 的 笑 着 进来 ： 两个 人 共 提着 一桶 水 ， 一手 撩 衣裳 ， 趔趔趄趄 泼泼 撒撒 的 。,Their conversation was interrupted by the giggles of Ripple and Emerald who had just entered the courtyard with a large bucket of water . Each of them held the bucket by one hand and lifted her skirts up with the other . They were staggering under the unaccustomed weight and slopping a good deal of the water about as they went .
那丫头 便 忙 迎 出去 接 。,The maid hurried out to relieve them .
秋纹 碧痕 ， 一个 抱怨 “ 你 湿 了 我 的 衣裳 ” ， 一个 又 说 “ 你 踹 了 我 的 鞋 ” 。,"By now the giggles had given way to recriminations : ' Look , you have soaked my dress ! ' ' You trod on my toe ! '"
忽 见 走出 一个 人 来 接水 ， 二人 看 时 ， 不是 别人 ， 原来 是 小 红 。,They stopped to look at this person who had just issued from the young Master 's room and saw with some surprise that it was Crimson .
二人 便 都 诧异 ， 将水 放下 ， 忙 进来 看 时 ， 并 没 别人 ， 只有 宝玉 ， 便 心中 俱 不自在 。,"Putting down the water , they hurried indoors to look . Bao-yu was there on his own . The girls were indignant ."
只得 且 预备 下 洗澡 之物 ， 待 宝玉 脱 了 衣裳 ， 二人 便 带上 门 出来 ， 走 到 那边 房 内 ， 找 着 小红 ， 问 他 ： “ 方才 在 屋里 做 什么 ？ ”,"As soon as they had prepared the bath and seen him undressed , they shut the door after them and hurried to the other side of the building to find Crimson . ' What were you doing in his room just now ? ' they asked her accusingly ."
小红道 ： “ 我 何曾 在 屋里 呢 ？,"' I was not doing anything , ' said Crimson ."
因为 我 的 绢子 找不着 ， 往后 头 找 去 ， 不想 二爷 要 茶 喝 ， 叫 姐姐 们 ， 一个 儿 也 没有 ， 我 赶着 进去 倒 了 碗 茶 ， 姐姐 们 就 来 了 。 ”,"' I could not find my handkerchief , so I went to look for it round the back . He was calling for some tea and none of you happened to be about , so I ran in and poured it out for him . And just at that moment you came back . '"
秋纹兜 脸 碎 了 一口 道 ： “ 没 脸面 的 下流 东西 ！,Ripple spat in her face : ' Nasty shameless little slut !
正经 叫 你 催 水 去 ， 你 说 有事 ， 倒 叫 我们 去 ， 你 可 抢 这个 巧宗儿 ！,"When we asked you to fetch the water for us you said you were busy and made us go ourselves . You did not waste much time , having got him to yourself , did you ?"
一里 一里 的 ， 这 不 上来 了 吗 ？ 难道 我们 倒 跟不上 你么 ？,"You think you are on the way up , do not you ? Step by step . Well , we can catch up with you , my fine lady !"
你 也 拿 镜子 照照 ， 配递 茶 递水 不配 ？ ”,Why do not you take a look at yourself in the mirror and then ask yourself if you are a fit person to go serving tea to the Masters ? '
碧痕 道 ： “ 明儿 我 说 给 他们 ， 凡 要 茶 要 水 拿 东西 的 事 ， 咱们 都 别动 ， 只 叫 他 去 就 完 了 。 ”,' We would better warn the others that when he asks for tea or anything in future they must stay where they are and let her go and get it ! '
秋纹 道 ： “ 这么 说 ， 还 不如 我们 散 了 ， 单 让 他 在 这 屋里 呢 ！ ”,"' In that case , ' said Ripple , ' the rest of us may as well clear off and let her have him all to herself !"
二人 你 一句 ， 我 一句 ， 正 闹 着 ， 只见 有个 老嬷嬷 进来 ， 传 凤姐 的话 说 ： “ 明日 有人 带 花儿匠 来 种树 ， 叫 你们 严紧 些 ， 衣裳 裙子 ， 别 混 晒 混 晾 的 。,"They were still at their antiphonal taunting when an old woman arrived with a message from Xi-feng : ' Someone is bringing some workmen in tomorrow to plant trees , so you have all got to be extra careful . No hanging clothes out to dry all over the place !"
那 土山 上 都 拦 着 围幕 ， 可别 混跑 。 ”,There will be screens put up along the line of the embankment and you are not to go running around outside . '
秋纹 便 问 ： “ 明日 不知 是 谁 带进 匠人 来 监工 ？ ”,' Who is the person in charge of the workmen ? ' asked Ripple .
那 老婆子 道 ： “ 什么 后廊 上 的 芸 哥儿 。 ”,"' A young chap called "" Yun "" from up the Lane , ' said the old woman ."
秋纹 碧痕 俱 不 知道 ， 只管 混问 别的 活 ， 那小红 心 内 明白 ， 知是 昨日 外 书房 所见 的 那人 了 。,"The name meant nothing to Ripple and Emerald , who went on to ask about other matters ; but Crimson knew it must be the young man she had met the day before in the outer study ."
原来 这 小红本 姓林 ， ［ 小名 红玉 ， 因 “ 玉 ” 字 犯 了 宝玉 、 黛玉 的 名 ， 便 改唤 他 做 “ 小红 ” 。 ］,Crimson 's surname was ' Lin ' .
原来 是 府 中 世仆 ， 他 父亲 现在 收管 各处 田房 事务 。,Her family had been retainers in the Jia family for generations . Nowadays her father worked as a farm-bailiff on the family 's estates .
这 小红 年 方 十四 ， 进府 当差 ， 把 他 派 在 怡红院 中 ， 倒 也 清幽 雅静 。,"She was sixteen . Along with many other servants , she had originally entered the Prospect Garden to carry out caretaking duties in the period when it was still unoccupied . The part of it she was assigned to was the House of Green Delights . She found it a very beautiful place to live in - very quiet and secluded ."
不想 后来 命 姊妹 及 宝玉 等 进 大观园 居住 ， 偏生 这 一所 儿 ， 又 被 宝玉 点 了 。,But this had changed when Bao-yu and the girls were commanded to move in and Bao-yu had chosen the House of Green Delights as his own residence .
这 小红 虽然 是 个 不谙 事体 的 丫头 ， 因 他 原有 几分 容貌 ， 心内 便 想 向上 攀高 ， 每每 要 在 宝玉 面前 现 弄现 弄 。,"Although Crimson was a very inexperienced maid , she had a measure of good looks and a determination to better herself . She was therefore constantly on the look-out for an opportunity of making herself known to Bao-yu and showing off her ability to serve him ."
只是 宝玉 身边 一干 人 都 是 伶牙利爪 的 ， 那里 插 的 下手 去 ？,Unfortunately the little group of body-servants who had accompanied him into the garden guarded their privileges with tooth and claw and were careful to allow no toehold to an ambitious outsider .
不想 今日 才 有些 消息 ， 又 遭 秋纹 等 一场 恶 话 ， 心内 早 灰 了 一半 。,"Today she had at last found an opening , only to have her hopes immediately dashed by Ripple 's malice . She felt very discouraged ."
正 没好气 ， 忽然 听见 老嬷嬷 说起 贾芸来 ， 不觉 心中 一动 ， 便 闷闷 的 回房 ， 睡 在 床上 ， 暗暗 思量 ； 翻来复去 ， 自觉 没情 没趣 的 。 忽 听 的 窗外 低低的 叫 道 ： “ 红儿 ， 你 的 绢子 我 拾 在 这里 呢 。 ”,"Still smarting with resentment , she heard the old woman say that Jia Yun was coming next day into the garden . The name provoked a momentary flutter in her breast ; but she returned to her room with the same feeling of resentment bottled up inside her and went to bed to ponder moodily on the events of the day . As the thoughts pursued themselves round and round in her mind without object or conclusion , she suddenly heard her name being called very softly outside her window : ' Crimson ! Crim ! I have found your handkerchief ! '"
小红 听 了 ， 忙 走出 来看 时 ： 不是 别人 ， 正是 贾芸 。,She quickly got up and went outside to look . To her surprise it was Jia Yun .
小红 不觉 粉面 含羞 ， 问道 ： “ 二爷 在 那里 拾 着 的 ？ ”,A maidenly confusion mantled her comely cheek . ' Where did you find it ? ' she asked timidly .
只见 那 贾芸笑 道 ： “ 你 过来 ， 我 告诉 你 。 ”,Jia Yun laughed : ' Come over here and I will show you ! '
一面 说 一面 就 上来 拉 他 的 衣裳 。,He took hold of her dress to pull her to him .
那小红 臊 的 转身 一 跑 ， 却 被 门槛 子 绊倒 。,"Overcome with shame , she turned and fled , but her foot caught on the threshold and she fell on her face ."
要知 端底 ， 下回分解 。,The conclusion of this adventure will be revealed in the following chapter .
第二十五回,Chapter 25
魇 魔法 叔嫂 逢五鬼,Two cousins are subjected by witchcraft to the assaults of demons
通灵玉 蒙蔽 遇 双真,And the Magic Jade meets an old acquaintance while rather the worse for wear
话 说 小 红 心神恍惚 ， 情思 缠绵 ， 忽 朦胧 睡 去 ， 遇见 贾芸 要 拉 他 ， 却 回身 一 跑 ， 被 门槛 绊 了 一跤 ， 唬 醒过来 ， 方知 是 梦 。,"We have seen how Crimson , after lying a long time a prey to confused and troubled thoughts , at last dozed off to sleep ; and how later , when Jia Yun grabbed at her , she turned and fled , only to stumble and fall on the threshold of her room . At that point she woke in bed and discovered that she had been dreaming ."
因此 翻来复去 ， 一夜 无眠 ， 至 次日 天明 ， 方才 起来 ， 有 几个 丫头 来 会 他 去 打扫 屋子 地面 ， 舀 洗脸水 。,"She did not get to sleep again after that , but lay tossing restlessly throughout the night . When daylight came at last , she got up , and shortly after was joined by the other maids who shared with her the early morning duties of sweeping the rooms and courtyards and fetching water for the others ' washing ."
这 小红 也 不 梳妆 ， 向 镜 中 胡乱 挽 了 一 挽 头发 ， 洗 了 洗手 脸 ， 便 来 打扫 房屋 。,"Crimson 's own toilet was a simple one : a brief look in the mirror while she coiled her hair , a quick wash , and she was ready to join the others in their sweeping ."
谁知 宝玉 昨儿 见 了 他 ， 也 就 留心 ， 想着 指 名唤 他 来 使用 ， 〈 一则 怕 袭 人 等 寒心 ， 二则 又 不知 他 是 何等 行为 ， 若 好 还 罢了 ， 若 不好 起来 ， 那时 倒 不好 退送 的 。,"Her encounter with Bao-yu had made a stronger impression on that impressionable young man than she realized . He had even thought of asking for her by name to wait upon him , but hesitated , partly from fear of offending Aroma and the rest , and partly because he did not know what she was really like and dreaded the unpleasantness of sending her away again if she proved unsatisfactory ."
因此 心下 闷闷 的 ， 〉 早晨 起来 ， 也 不 梳洗 ， 只 坐 着 出神 。,"The question still preoccupied him when he woke that morning . He rose quite early and sat musing silently on his own , making no effort to begin his toilet"
一时 下 了 纸窗 ， 隔 着 纱 屉子 ， 向外看 的 真切 ， 只见 几个 丫头 在 那里 打扫 院子 ， 都 擦 胭 抹粉 、 插花 带 柳 的 ， 独 不见 昨儿 那 一个 。,"In a little while the paper-covered shutters were removed and he was able to see clearly through the silken gauze of the casement into the courtyard outside . He could see several girls there sweeping , all of them heavily made-up and with flowers and ornaments in their hair , but no sign of the quiet , neat girl of the day before ."
宝玉 便 靸 拉 着 鞋 ， 走出 房门 ， 只 装做 看 花 ， 东瞧西望 。,"He went outside in his slippers to look around , pretending that he had gone out to inspect the flowers ."
一 抬头 ， 只见 西南角 上 游廊 下 栏杆 旁 有 一个 人 倚 在 那里 ， 却 为 一株 海棠花 所 遮 ， 看 不 真切 。,"He could see someone leaning on the balustrade in the south-west corner of the cloister-like covered walk , but she was half hidden by the crab-apple tree and he could not make out who it was ."
近前 一步 仔细 看 时 ， 正是 昨儿 那个 丫头 ， 在 那里 出神 。,"He approached and looked more closely . It was she , yesterday 's girl , standing there on her own , apparently lost in thought ."
此时 宝玉 要 迎上去 ， 又 不好意思 。 正 想着 ， 忽 见 碧痕 来 请 洗脸 ， 只得 进去 了 。,He was a little shy of addressing her at that particular moment and was still hesitating when Emerald came up and asked him to come in and wash . He had to go in again without having spoken to her .
却说 小红正 自 出神 ， 忽 见 袭 人 招手 叫 他 ， 只得 走上 前来 。,"While Crimson stood there musing , she suddenly became aware that Aroma was beckoning to her , and hurried up to see what she wanted ."
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 咱们 的 喷壶 坏 了 ， 你 到 林姑娘 那边 借用 一 用 。 ”,"' Our spittoon is broken , ' Aroma said . ' Can you go to Miss Lin 's and ask them if they will lend us one until we can get a replacement ? '"
小红 便 走向 潇湘 馆 去 ， 到 了 翠烟桥 ， 抬头 一 望 ， 只见 山坡 高处 都 拦 着 帷幕 ， 方 想起 今日 有 匠 役 在 此种 树 。,"Crimson hurried off in the direction of the Naiad 's House . When she got to Green Haze Bridge , she stopped a moment to look around . She noticed that cloth screens had been set up all along the side of the artificial hill , and remembered that this was the day on which the workmen were coming into the garden to plant trees ."
原来 远远 的 一簇 人 在 那里 掘土 ， 贾芸正 坐在 山子石 上 监工 。,She could just make out a knot of workmen digging a hole in the distance and Jia Yun sitting on some rocks supervising them .
小红 待 要 过去 ， 又 不敢 过去 ， 只得 悄悄 向潇湘 馆 ， 取 了 喷壶 而 回 ； 无精打彩 ， 自向 房内 躺 着 。,"She would have liked to go over , but did not quite dare , and having collected the spittoon , returned , in very low spirits , and lay down in her own room to brood ."
众人 只说 他 是 身子 不快 ， 也 不 理论 。,The others all assumed that she must be feeling unwell and took no notice .
过 了 一日 ， 原来 次日 是 王子腾 夫人 的 寿诞 ， 那里 原 打发 人 来 请 贾母 、 王夫人 ， 王夫人 见 贾母 不 去 ， 也 不便 去 了 。,"Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-teng 's lady . A message had already been received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day with her . Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable , even though the invitation was from her brother 's wife , because she could see that Grandmother Jia did not want to ."
倒 是 薛姨妈 同着 凤姐儿 并 贾家 三个 姊妹 、 宝钗 、 宝玉 ， 一齐 都 去 了 。,"Wang Zi-teng 's other sister , Aunt Xue , went instead , together with his niece Xi-feng , Bao-chai , Bao-yu and the three Jia girls ."
至 晚方 回 。,They did not return until the evening .
〈 可巧 王夫人 〉 见 贾环 下 了 学 ， 命 他 去 抄 《 金刚经 咒 》 唪 诵 。,"Not long before they returned , Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious prophylactic against sickness and misfortune , the Dharani of the Immaculate Diamond ."
那 贾环便 来到 王夫人 炕上 坐 着 ， 命人 点 了 蜡烛 ， 拿腔做势 的 抄写 。 一时 又 叫 彩云 倒 钟茶来 ， 一时 又 叫 玉钏剪 蜡花 ， 又 说 金钏 挡 了 灯 亮儿 。,"He seated himself on Lady Wang 's kang , called for a candle to be lit , and , with a great deal of self-important fuss , began his copying , one minute calling for Suncloud to pour him tea , the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle , and shortly after that informing Golden that she was standing in his light ."
众 丫鬟 们 素日 厌恶 他 ， 都 不 答理 。 只有 彩霞 还 和 他 合得来 ， 倒 了 茶 给 他 ， 因 向 他 悄悄的 道 ： “ 你 安分 些 罢 ， 何苦 讨人厌 ！ ”,"The maids all hated Jia Huan and took no notice - all , that is , except Sunset , who had always had a soft spot for him . She poured him a cup of tea and , observing that Lady Wang was engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment , quietly counselled some restraint : ' Try not to throw your weight about so ! ' she said . ' It is silly to put people 's backs up . '"
贾环 把 眼一 瞅 道 ： “ 我 也 知道 ， 你 别 哄 我 。,"Jia Huan scowled angrily : ' I know what I am doing , ' he said . ' Do not talk to me like a child !"
如今 你 和 宝玉 好 了 ， 不理 我 ， 我 也 看 出来 了 。 ”,"You are friends with Bao-yu nowadays , are not you ? You do not like me any more . I know . I have watched you both . '"
彩霞 咬着牙 ， 向 他 头上 戳 了 一 指头 ， 道 ： “ 没良心 的 ！ ‘ 狗咬吕洞宾 — — 不识好歹 。 ’ ”,Sunset clenched her teeth . She stabbed the air above his head with her finger : ' You ungrateful thing ! You are like the dog that bit Lü Dong-bin : you do not know a friend when you see one . '
两 人 正说 着 ， 〈 只见 凤姐 来 了 ， 〉 王夫人 便 一长一短 问 他 今日 是 那 几位 堂客 ， 戏文 好歹 ， 酒席 如何 。,"They were still exchanging words when Xi-feng came in , having just got back from the birthday party . Lady Wang wanted to know about the other ladies who had been invited , whether the plays had been any good , and what sort of things they had had to eat and drink ."
不多时 ， 宝玉 也 来 了 ， 见 了 王夫人 ， 也 规规矩矩 说 了 几句话 ， 便 命 人 除去 了 抹额 ， 脱 了 袍服 ， 拉 了 靴子 ， 就 一头 滚 在 王夫人 怀里 ， 王夫人 便 用手 摩掌 抚弄 他 ， 宝玉 也 扳着 王夫人 的 脖子 说长说短 的 。,"In a little while Bao-yu , too , arrived , and after a few respectful words to his mother , asked the servants to take off his headband and gown for him and help him off with his boots . Disencumbered , he flung himself into his mother 's bosom to be fondled and petted by her , then , worming his way up and nuzzling affectionately against her neck , he proceeded to add his own amusing commentary on the day 's events ."
王夫人 道 ： “ 我 的 儿 ， 又 吃 多 了 酒 ， 脸上 滚热 的 。 你 还 只是 揉搓 ， 一会 子 闹 上 酒 来 ！ 还 不在 那里 静静的 躺 一会 子 去 呢 。 ”,"' You have been drinking again , child , ' said Lady Wang . ' Your face is burning . All this romping about will make you sick . Lie down quietly for a while over there ! '"
说 着 ， 便 叫 人 拿 枕头 。 宝玉 因 就 在 王夫人 身后 倒下 ， 又 叫 彩霞 来 替 他 拍 着 。,"She made them bring him a head-rest , and he lay down behind her , towards the back of the kang . Sunset was instructed to massage him by gently patting his legs ."
宝玉 便 和 彩霞 说 笑 ， 只见 彩霞 淡淡的 不大 答理 ， 两眼 只 向着 贾环 。,"He tried to joke with Sunset as she knelt beside him , but she barely acknowledged his questions and answered frigidly , directing her eyes and all her attention upon Jia Huan ."
宝玉 便 拉 他 的 手 ， 说道 ： “ 好 姐姐 ， 你 也 理 我 理儿 ！ ”,"Bao-yu seized her hand : ' Come , my dear ! You must take notice of me if I speak to you ! '"
一面 说 ， 一面 拉 他 的 手 。 彩霞 夺手 不肯 ， 便 说 ： “ 再 闹 就 嚷 了 ！ ”,"He tugged at her hand as he spoke , but she snatched it from his grasp . ' If you do that again , she said , I shall call out ! '"
二人 正 闹 着 ， 原来 贾环 听见 了 ， — — 素日 原 恨宝玉 ， 今 见 他 和 彩霞 玩耍 ， 心上 越发 按 不下 这 口气 。,"Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange . He had always hated Bao-yu , and this flirting with Sunset - his Sunset - was the last straw . He must be revenged or burst ."
因一 沉思 ， 计上心来 ， 故作 失手 ， 将 那 一盏 油汪汪 的 蜡烛 ， 向宝玉 脸上 只 一 推 ； 只 听宝玉 “ 暧哟 ” 的 一声 ， 满 屋里人 都 唬 了 一 跳 。,"A moment 's reflection suggested the means . He had only to feign a slight clumsiness of the hand and it was done . The candle , brimming with molten wax , toppled straight on to Bao-yu 's face . There was a piercing cry , which made everyone else in the room jump ."
连忙 将 地下 的 绰灯 移过来 一 照 ， 只见 宝玉 满脸 是 油 。,Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below . By their light Bao-yu 's face was seen to be covered all over in wax .
王夫人 又 气 又 急 ， 忙 命 人 替 宝玉 擦洗 ， 一面 骂 贾环 。,"Torn between anguish for him and anger with Jia Huan , Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as possible , while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness ."
凤姐 三步 两步 上 炕去 替 宝玉 收拾 着 ， 一面 说 ： “ 这 老三 还是 这么 ‘ 毛 脚 鸡 ’ 似的 。 我 说 你 上 不得 台盘 ！ — — 赵姨娘 平时 也 该 教导 教导 他 ！ ”,"Xi-feng scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants , grumbling at Jia Huan as she did so : ' Huan , you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met ! You are simply not fit for decent company . I do not know why Aunt Zhao hasn ' t taught you better . '"
一句 话 提醒 了 王夫人 ， 遂 叫 过 赵姨娘 来 ， 骂 道 ： “ 养出 这样 黑心 种子 来 ， 也 不 教训 教训 ！,"Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the servants . She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and , summoning Aunt Zhao , directed all her wrath upon that luckless concubine : ' This is a fine son you bore us , I must say ! He is a black-hearted little monster ! You might at least try to teach him better . But no ."
几番 几次 我 都 不 理论 ， 你们 一发 得 了意 了 ！ 一发 上来 了 ！ ”,"Time and again I have overlooked this sort of thing , but instead of feeling sorry , you glory in it . You think that when I do nothing , you have got the better of me . '"
那 赵姨娘 只得 忍气吞声 ， 也 上去 帮 着 他们 替 宝玉 收拾 。,Aunt Zhao was obliged to swallow her anger and endure these taunts in silence .
只见 宝玉 左边 脸上 起 了 一溜 燎泡 ， 幸而 没伤 眼睛 。,She climbed up onto the kang and made a show of helping the others with the injured boy .
王夫人 看 了 ， 又 心疼 ， 又 怕 贾母问 时 难以 回答 ， 急 的 又 把 赵姨娘 骂 一顿 ； 又 安慰 了 宝玉 ； 一面 取 了 “ 败毒 散 ” 来 敷上 。,"She looked at his face . The whole left side of it was badly blistered . It was a wonder that the eye had not been damaged . When Lady Wang saw it , she was both full of anguish for her son and at the same time , when she thought of the questioning to which she would inevitably be subjected by Grandmother Jia and wondered what she would say , terrified on her own account . To relieve her fear she turned once more on Aunt Zhao . Then , after tonguelashing the concubine , she comforted her beloved son and applied Antiphlogistic Ointment to the blistered part of his face ."
宝玉 说 ： “ 有些 疼 ， 还 不妨 事 。,"' It does hurt a bit , ' said Bao-yu when she asked him , but nothing very terrible ."
明日 老太太 问 ， 只说 我 自己 烫 的 就是 了 。 ”,"When Grandma asks about it , we had better tell her that I did it . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 就 说 自己 烫 的 ， 也 要 骂人 不 小心 ， 横竖 有 一场 气生 。 ”,"' She will blame the rest of us for not looking after you properly , even if you say you did it yourself , ' said Xi-feng . ' There will be a row , whatever you say . '"
王夫人 命人 好生 送 了 宝玉 回房 去 。,Lady Wang told them to see him back to his room .
袭 人 等 见 了 ， 都 慌 的 了不得 。,It was a great shock to Aroma and the other maids when they saw him .
那黛玉 见 宝玉 出 了 一天 的 门 ， 便 闷闷 的 ， 晚间 打发 人 来 问 了 两三遍 ， 知道 烫 了 ， 便 亲自 赶过来 ， 只 瞧见 宝玉 自己 拿 镜子 照 呢 。,"Dai-yu had had a dull time of it with Bao-yu away all day , and in the course of the evening sent several times round to his room to inquire whether he was back yet . It was in this way that she heard about his scalding . She hurried round immediately to see for herself how he was . She found him with a mirror in his hand , examining the extent of the damage ."
左边 脸上 满满的 敷 了 一脸 药 。 黛玉 只当 十分 烫 的 利害 ， 忙 近前 瞧瞧 ， 宝玉 却 把 脸 遮 了 ， 摇手 叫 他 出去 ： 知 他 素性 好洁 ， 故 不肯 叫 他 瞧 。,"The entire left side of his face was thickly plastered with ointment , from which she deduced that the injury must be a serious one . But when she approached him to look closer , he averted his head and waved her away . He knew how squeamish she was , and feared that the sight of it would upset her ."
黛玉 也 就 罢了 ， 但 问 他 ： “ 疼 的 怎样 ？ ”,Dai-yu for her part was sufficiently aware of her own weakness not to insist on looking . She merely asked him ' whether it hurt very badly ' .
宝玉 道 ： “ 也 不 很 疼 。 养 一两日 就 好 了 。 ”,"' Not so bad as all that , ' said Bao-yu . ' A couple of days and it will probably be all right again . '"
黛玉 坐 了 一会 回去 了 。,Dai-yu sat with him a little longer and then went back to her room .
次日 ， 宝玉 见 了 贾母 ， 虽 自己 承认 自己 烫 的 ， 贾母 免不得 又 把 跟从 的 人 骂 了 一顿 。,"Next day Bao-yu had to see Grandmother Jia . Although he told her that he had burned himself through his own carelessness , the old lady , as had been predicted , berated his attendants for having allowed the accident to happen ."
过 了 一日 ， 有 宝玉 寄名 的 干娘 马道婆 到 府 里 来 ， 见 了 宝玉 ， 唬 了 一大跳 ， 问 其 缘由 ， 说 是 烫 的 ， 便 点头 叹息 ， 一面 向宝玉 脸上 用 指头 画 了 几画 ， 口 内 嘟嘟 嚷嚷 的 ， 又 咒诵 了 一回 ， 说道 ： “ 包管 好 了 。 这 不过 是 一时 飞灾 。 ”,"Another day went by , and Bao-yu 's godmother , old Mother Ma , called round . Mother Ma was a Wise Woman . Her special relationship with Bao-yu had been arranged in his infancy to ensure him the protection of her powers . She was shocked by her godson 's appearance and , on being informed of the cause , shook her head and tutted sympathetically . She made a few signs over his face with her fingers , muttering some gibberish as she did so , after which she assured them that he would soon be better : the malignant aura that had caused the accident was of a transitory , impermanent nature ."
又 向 贾母 道 ： “ 老祖宗 ， 老 菩萨 ， 那里 知道 那 佛经 上说 的 利害 ！,"She turned to Grandmother Jia : ' Bless you , my lucky lady ! Bless you dearie ! You do not know a half of the unseen harms and dangers the Scripture tells us of ."
大凡 王公 卿相 人家 的 子弟 ， 只 一 生长 下来 ， 暗里 就 有 多少 促狭 鬼 跟着 他 ， 得空儿 就 拧 他 一下 ， 或 掐 他 一下 ， 或 吃饭 时 打下 他 的 饭碗 来 ， 或 走 着 推 他 一跤 ， 所以 往往 的 那些 大家 子孙 多 有 长不大 的 。 ”,All the sons of princes and great folks the moment they begin to grow up are followed round everywhere they go by troops of invisible little imps - spiteful little creatures who nip them and pinch them whenever they can . Sometimes they knock the ricebowl from their hands when they are eating . Sometimes they push them over when they are walking . It is on account of these creatures that so many young gentlemen of good family do not live to make old bones . '
贾母 听 如此 说 ， 便 问 ： “ 这 有 什么 法儿 解救 没有 呢 ？ ”,Grandmother Jia was anxious to know if the afflicted person could be freed from these unwelcome attentions .
马道婆 便 说道 ： “ 这个 容易 ， 只是 替 他 多 做 些 因果 善事 ， 也 就 罢了 。,"' Easily , ' said Mother Ma. ' By doing good works . Giving a bit more to charity on the young person 's behalf ."
再 那 经 上 还 说 ： 西方 有位 大 光明 普照 菩萨 ， 专管 照耀 阴暗 邪祟 ， 若 有 善男信女 虔心 供奉 者 ， 可以 永保 儿孙 康宁 ， 再 无 撞客 邪祟 之灾 。 ”,"There is another way , though . According to what the Scripture says , there is a Bodhisattva of Universal Light living in the Paradise of the West who spends his time lighting up the dark places where these evil spirits lurk , and if any believer , male or female , will make offerings to that Bodhisattva in a proper spirit of devoutness , he will grant their children and grandchildren his holy peace and protect them from possession by devils and from the powers of darkness . '"
贾母 道 ： “ 倒 不知 怎么 供奉 这位 菩萨 ？ ”,' What sort of offerings do you make to this Bodhisattva ? ' Grandmother Jia asked her .
马道婆 说 ： “ 也 不值 什么 ， 不过 除 香烛 供奉 以外 ， 一天 多 添 几斤 香油 ， 点 个 大海 灯 。,"' Nothing very special . Apart from the usual incense offerings , we take a few pounds of sesame oil each day and make what we call a "" sea of light "" by burning wicks in it ."
那 海灯 就是 菩萨 现身 的 法象 ， 昼夜不息 的 。 ”,We believe that this sea of light is the trans-substantial body of the Bodhisattva . It has to be kept burning night and day and never allowed to go out . '
贾母 道 ： “ 一天 一夜 也 得 多少 油 ？ 我 也 做 个 好事 。 ”,' How much oil does it take to keep it burning for one whole day and night ? ' said Grandmother Jia . ' I should like to do this for the boy .
马道婆 说 ： “ 这 也 不拘 多少 ， 随 施主 愿心 。,"' There is no fixed amount , ' said Mother Ma. ' We leave it to our clients to decide how much they want to give ."
象 我 家里 就 有 好几处 的 王妃 诰命 供奉 的 ： 南安 郡王府 里 太妃 ， 他 许 的 愿心 大 ， 一天 是 四十八斤 油 ， 一斤 灯草 ， 那 海灯 也 只 比 缸 略 小 些 ； 锦乡 侯 的 诰命 次一等 ， 一天 不过 二十斤 油 ； 再有 几家 ， 或 十斤 、 八斤 、 三斤 、 五斤 的 不等 ， 也 少不得 要 替 他 点 。 ”,"There are several members of the aristocracy among those I do this service for . Let's see . . . There is the Prince of Nan-an 's lady . She is my biggest subscriber . Her subscription is for forty-eight pounds of oil and a pound of lampwicks a day . Her sea of light is pretty nearly as big as a cistern . Then there is the Marquis of Jin-xiang 's lady : twenty pounds of oil a day . Oh , and there is some pays for ten pounds a day , some for eight pounds , three pounds , five pounds - all sorts . All of them I keep their seas of light burning for them , back at my house . '"
贾母 点头 思忖 。,Grandmother Jia nodded thoughtfully .
马道婆 道 ： “ 还有 一件 ， 若是 为 父母 尊长 的 ， 多 舍 些 不妨 ； 既 是 老祖宗 为 宝玉 ， 若 舍多 了 ， 怕 哥儿 担不起 ， 反折 了 福气 了 。,"' One thing I should mention , said Mother Ma ( observing the thoughtfulness ) : ' if the offering is for an older person - a mother or father , say - it does not matter how much you subscribe ; but if it is an older person making it for a younger one , like as it may be Your Ladyship for Bao-yu , you do not want to subscribe too much , or it would overload his luck and have the opposite effect ."
要 舍 ， 大则 七斤 ， 小 则 五斤 ， 也 就是 了 。 ”,"In the case of Your Ladyship subscribing for Bao-yu , I should suggest between five and seven pounds a day : '"
贾母 道 ： “ 既 这么样 ， 就 一日 五斤 ， 每月 打 总儿 关了 去 。 ”,"' Make it five pounds a day , then , ' said Grandmother Jia . ' We will work out the total and send you a month 's supply every month . '"
马道婆 道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ， 慈悲 大 菩萨 ！ ”,"' Amitabha , Merciful Buddha ! Bless His Holy Name ! ' said Mother Ma."
贾母 又 叫 人 来 吩咐 ： “ 以后 宝玉 出门 ， 拿 几串 钱 交给 他 的 小子 们 ， 一路 施舍 给 僧道 贫苦 之 人 。 ”,As a further precaution Grandmother Jia called in some of Bao-yu 's maids and told them that in future whenever Bao-yu went out anywhere his pages were to be provided with several strings of cash to give as alms to any itinerant monks or priests or any poor or afficted persons they might meet upon the way .
说 毕 ， 那道婆 便 往 各 房 问安 闲逛 去 了 。,"After seeing Grandmother jia , Mother Ma drifted round the mansion calling at various other apartments ."
一时 来到 赵姨娘 屋里 ， 二人 见 过 ， 赵姨娘 命 小丫头 倒 茶 给 他 吃 。,"Presently she came to Aunt Zhao 's room . After they had exchanged greetings , Aunt Zhao told her little servant to pour the old woman a cup of tea ."
赵姨娘 正 粘 鞋 呢 ， 马道婆 见 炕 上 堆 着 些 零星 绸缎 ， 因说 ： “ 我 正 没有 鞋 面子 ， 姨奶奶 给 我些 零碎 绸子 缎子 ， 不拘 颜色 ， 做 双鞋 穿 罢 。 ”,"Aunt Zhao was pasting pieces of cloth together for soling shoes with , and Mother Ma observed that the kang around her was piled with miscellaneous remnants of material . ' I am looking for something to make a pair of uppers out of , dearie , ' said Mother Ma. ' I suppose you haven ' t got an old bit of silk or an old bit of satin that would do ? It does not matter about the colour . '"
赵姨娘 叹 口气道 ： “ 你 瞧 ， 那里 头 还有 块 象样儿 的么 ？,Aunt Zhao heaved a long-suffering sigh : ' Take a look at this lot ! You will not find anything much worth having here .
有 好 东西 也 到 不了 我 这里 。,Nothing worth having in this family ever comes my way .
你 不 嫌 不好 ， 挑 两块 去 就是 了 。 ”,But you are welcome to pick out a couple of pieces if you do not mind the poor quality . '
马道婆 便 挑 了 几块 ， 掖 在 袖里 。,"Mother Ma rummaged around in the heap , and having picked out several pieces , stuffed them into her sleeve ."
赵姨娘 又 问 ： “ 前日 我 打发 人 送 了 五百 钱 去 ， 你 可 在 药王 面前 上 了 供 没有 ？ ”,"' I sent someone round to you the other day with five hundred cash to pay for an offering to the Medicine Buddha , ' said Aunt Zhao . Have you managed to make it yet ? '"
马道婆 道 ： “ 早已 替 你 上 了 。 ”,' Oh yes . That was done days ago . '
赵姨娘 叹气 道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！ 我 手里 但凡 从容 些 ， 也 时常 来 上供 ， 只是 ‘ 心有余而力不足 ’ 。 ”,' Holy Name ! ' said Aunt Zhao . ' I would do it oftener if things were a bit easier ; but you know the saying : ' my heart is willing but my purse is lean ' ! '
马道婆 道 ： “ 你 只 放心 ， 将来 熬 的 环哥 大 了 ， 得 个 一官半职 ， 那时 你 要 做 多 大 功德 ， 还 怕 不能 么 ？ ”,"' Do not you worry about that ! ' said Mother Ma. ' You only have to hold out a few more years . When your Huan has grown up and got himself a job in the Service , you will be able to afford all the good works you want . '"
赵姨娘 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 罢 ， 罢 ！ 再 别 提起 ！ 如今 就是 榜样 。 我们 娘儿们 跟 的 上 这 屋里 那 一个 儿 ？,Aunt Zhao made a scornful sound in her nose : ' Hfn ! Let's not talk about it ! It will be no different then from what it is now : Huan and I will never be able to compete with the Other One .
〈 也 不是 有 了 宝玉 ， 竟是 得 了 活 龙 ！,It is like the Heavenly Dragon appearing when he comes on the scene .
他 〉 还是 小孩子 家 ， 长 的 得 人意 儿 ， 大人 偏疼 他些 儿 ， 也 还 罢了 ； 我 只 不服 这个 主儿 ！ ”,"Mind you , I do not hold it against the child . He is a goodlooking boy , is Bao-yu , and you can understand the grown-ups being silly about him . No , this is the one I can not stand . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 伸 了 两个 指头 。,"As she uttered the word ' this ' , she held up two fingers ."
马道婆 会意 ， 便 问道 ： “ 可是 琏 二 奶奶 ？ ”,Mother Ma guessed her meaning : ' Number Two ' - the younger of the Rong mansion 's two daughters-in-law . ' You mean Mrs Lian ? ' she said .
赵姨娘 唬 的 忙 摇手 儿 ， 〈 走 到 门前 ， 掀帘子 向外看 看 无人 ， 方 进来 向 马道婆 悄悄 说道 〉 ： “ 了不得 ， 了不得 ！ 提起 这个 主儿 ， 这 一分 家私 要 不 都 叫 他 搬 了 娘家 去 ， 我 也 不是 个人 ！ ”,"Aunt Zhao 's face assumed an expression of terror . Motioning agitatedly to the other to remain silent , she got up , went to the door , raised the door-blind , looked around , and having satisfied herself that there were no eavesdroppers , came back and sat down again , her face close to Mother Ma 's . ' She is a dreadful person - dreadful ! If that woman does not end up by carrying off every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with , my name 's not Zhao ! '"
马道婆 见 说 ， 便 探 他 的 口气道 ： “ 我 还 用 你 说 ？ 难道 都 看不出来 ！ 也 亏了 你们 心里 不 理论 ， 只 凭 他 去 。 — — 倒 也好 。 ”,"Mother Ma sensed interesting possibilities in this conversation , and was quick to explore them : ' It does not need you to tell me that , ' she said . ' You surely do not think I haven ' t noticed that ? I have often wondered why you all let her get away with it - though I suppose it is probably just as well you do . '"
赵姨娘 道 ： “ 我 的 娘 ！ 不 凭 他 去 ， 难道 谁 还 敢 把 他 怎么样 吗 ？ ”,"' My dear good woman , ' said Aunt Zhao , ' we have no choice but to let her get away with it . Who would ever have the nerve to stand up to her ? '"
马道婆 道 ： “ 不是 我 说 句 造孽 的话 ： 你们 没本事 ！ — — 也 难怪 。 明里 不敢 罢 咧 ， 暗里 也 算计 了 ！ 还 等到 如今 ！ ”,"' Well , ' said Mother Ma , ' I do not want to seem a trouble-maker , but if you do not mind my saying so , you do all seem to have acted a hit helpless about her - not that I am blaming you , mind . But I mean to say , even if you daren ' t stand up to her openly , there are things you could do in secret . I am surprised you haven ' t thought of it before . '"
赵姨娘 听 这 话里有话 ， 心里 暗暗 的 喜欢 ， 便 说道 ： “ 怎么 暗里 算计 ？ 我 倒 有 这个 心 ， 只是 没 这样 的 能干 人 。 你 教给 我 这个 法子 ， 我 大大的 谢 你 。 ”,"To Aunt Zhao the words seemed to contain a hidden promise . She concealed her pleasure . ' What do you mean : "" things we could do in secret "" ? ' she said . ' I am willing enough to do them : it is just that I have never met anyone who could tell me how . If you would show me the way , I would pay you . I would pay a lot . '"
马道婆 听 了 这话 拿拢 了 一处 ， 便 又 故意 说道 ： “ 阿弥陀佛 ！ 你 快别 问 我 ， 我 那里 知道 这些 事 ？ 〈 罪过 ， 罪过 。 〉 ”,"Mother Ma could see that they understood each other , but she was taking no chances . ' Holy Name ! Do not ask me about things like that ! I do not touch that kind of business . No , no , no . That is wicked . '"
赵姨娘 道 ： “ 你 又 来 了 ！ 你 是 最肯 济困扶危 的 人 ， 难道 就 眼睁睁 的 看着 人家 来 摆布 死 了 我们 娘儿们 不成 ？ — — 难道 还怕 我 不谢 你么 ？ ”,"' There you are ! ' said Aunt Zhao . ' That is all the help I ever get . And I thought you were such a kind person , always helping those in trouble . Are you prepared to stand by and watch me and my Huan being made mincemeat of by that scheming woman ? I suppose it is because you think I would not pay you . '"
马道婆 听 如此 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 要说 我 不忍 你们 娘儿 两个 受 别人 的 委屈 ， 还 犹可 ， 〈 若 说谢 我 的 这 两个 字 ， 可是 你 错 打算盘 了 。,"' If you was to say that I am too tender-hearted to stand by and watch you and your boy being wronged , ' said Mother Ma , ' you would be saying no more nor less than the truth . But I do not know what you mean about pay ."
就 便是 我 希图 你 谢 ， 靠 你 有些 什么 东西 能 打动 我 ？ 〉 ”,"What have you got that you could tempt me with , dearie , even if I was willing to do it for pay ? '"
赵姨娘 听 这话 松动 了 些 ， 便 说 ： “ 你 这么 个 明白人 ， 怎么 糊涂 了 ？ 果然 法子 灵验 ， 把 他 两人绝 了 ， 这 家私 还 怕 不是 我们 的 ？ 那 时候 你 要 什么 不得 呢 ？ ”,"Aunt Zhao observed that her opposition to the very idea of helping her in the desired way had considerably weakened . ' For someone so clever , ' she said , ' are not you being rather stupid ? If you help me and it works , with the two of them safely out of the way , everything in this household will be ours . You will be able to ask for what you like . Fancy not thinking of that ! '"
马道婆 听 了 ， 低 了 半日头 ， 说 ： “ 那 时候 儿 事情 妥当 了 ， 又 无 凭据 ， 你 还理 我 呢 ！ ”,"Mother Ma lowered her head and reflected for a while in silence . ' When that time comes and you are safely landed , ' she said eventually , ' you will not want to have anything more to do with me , dearie - not when I have got no proof to show what I done for you . '"
赵姨娘 道 ： “ 这 有 何难 ？ 我 攒 了 几两 体己 ， 还 有些 衣裳 首饰 ， 你 先 拿 几样 去 ； 我 再 写 个 欠 契 给 你 ， 〈 你 要 什么 保人 也 有 ， 那时 我 照数 给 你 。 ”,"' That is no problem , ' said Aunt Zhao . ' I have got a few taels put by of my own savings , and I have got some dresses , and there is my jewellery . You can take some of each to be getting on with and I can give you an IOU promising to pay you so much later on . We can have a witness too , if you like . '"
马道婆 道 ： “ 果然 这样 ？ ”,' Are you sure ? '
赵姨娘 道 ： “ 这 如何 还 撒 得 谎 ？ ” 说 着 便 叫 过 一个 心腹 婆子 来 ， 耳根 底下 喊 喊 喳喳 说 了 几句话 。,"' Why should I tell a lie ? ' said Aunt Zhao , and summoned a trusted crone into whose ear she whispered instructions : ' Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps . '"
那婆子 出去 了 ， 一时 回来 ， 果然 写 了 个 五百两 欠 契 来 。,"The old crone nodded and went out , returning after a few minutes with a promissory note for five hundred taels of silver ."
赵姨娘 便 印 了 手模 ， 走 到 橱柜 里 将 梯 己 拿 了 出来 。,Aunt Zhao made her mark on it and then went to the wardrobe to get out her savings .
马道婆 看看 白花花 的 一堆 银子 ， 又 有 欠 契 ， 并 不顾 青红皂白 ， 满口 里 应 着 ， 伸手 先去 抓 了 银子 掖 起来 ， 然后 收 了 欠 契 。,"The white shine of silver and the signed and sealed IOU dispelled whatever residual doubts the Wise Woman may have entertained , for she seized and pocketed both with alacrity , giving hearty assurances of her aid as she did so ;"
向 裤腰 里 掏 了 半晌 ， 掏出 十个 纸 铰 的 青 面红 发的鬼来 ， 并 两个 纸人 ， 递 与 赵姨娘 ， 又 悄悄的 教 她 道 ： “ 把 他 两个 的 年庚 八字 写 在 这 两个 纸人 身上 ， 一并 五个 鬼 都 掖 在 他们 各人 的 床上 就 完 了 。,"then , after rummaging for some time in the capacious waistband of her trousers , she fished out twelve little paper cut-out figures - ten of them demons with green faces and red hair and two of them plain human figures - and handed them to Aunt Zhao . Dropping her voice to a whisper , she instructed her to write the eight symbols of her victims ' nativitytwo for the year , two for the month , two for the day and two for the hour - on each of the human figures , wrap five of the demons round each of them , and slip them somewhere under her victims ' beds . ' That is all you have to do , ' she said ."
我 只 在 家里 作法 ， 自有 效验 。 千万 小心 ， 不要 害怕 。 ”,"' I shall be doing other things at home to help you . It is sure to work - no question of that . But you must be very , very careful . And you must not be afraid . '"
正 才 说 着 ， 只见 王夫人 的 丫鬟 进来 找道 ： “ 马 奶奶 可 在 这里 。 太太 等 你 呢 。 ”,"While she was still talking , one of Lady Wang 's maids came in looking for her . ' Oh , here you are ! Her Ladyship is waiting for you . '"
二人 方 散 了 ， 不在话下 。 〉,Mother Ma went off in the company of the maid .
却说 黛玉 因 宝玉 烫 了 脸 不 出门 ， 倒常 在 一处 说话 儿 。,And there we leave her .
〈 这日 饭后 ， 看 了 两篇 书 ， 自觉 无趣 ， 便 同 紫鹃 雪雁 做 了 一回 针线 ， 更觉 烦闷 ， 便 倚 着 房门 出 了 一回 神 ， 信步 出来 ， 看 阶下 新 进出 的 稚笋 ， 不觉 出 了 院门 。,"Because of the injury to his face , Bao-yu had stopped going out of doors since his accident and Dai-yu spent a good deal of time in his apartment talking to him . One morning after lunch she had settled down to read , but after a couple of chapters grew bored with the book and did some sewing instead with the maids Nightingale and Snowgoose . When that , too , became boring , she stood for a while leaning against the doorway , vacantly looking out . The young bamboo shoots were just breaking through in the forecourt , and after inspecting them , she drifted out into the Garden ."
一 望 园中 ， 四顾无人 ， 惟见 花光 ［ 柳影 ］ ， 鸟语 溪声 。,"Everywhere the flowers were blooming , the birds were singing , and the water splashed and tinkled , but not a human soul was to be seen ."
林黛玉 信步 便 往 怡红院 中来 ， 只见 几个 丫头 舀水 ， 都 在 回廊 上 围着 看 画眉 洗澡 呢 。 〉,"Almost without thinking where she was going , she made her way to the House of Green Delights . A group of maids had fetched some water from the well and were watching the white-eyes in the gallery giving themselves a bath . A sound of laughter came from inside the house ."
听见 房内 笑声 ， 原来 是 李 纨 、 凤姐 、 宝钗 都 在 这里 。,"Li Wan , Xi-feng and Bao-chai were there already ."
一 见 他 进来 ， 都 笑 道 ： “ 这 不 又 来 了 〈 一 〉 个 ？ ”,Their friendly laughter greeted Dai-yu as she entered : ' Another one ! Come in ! Come in ! '
黛玉笑 道 ： “ 今日 齐全 ， 谁 下帖子 请 的 ？ ”,"' What is this ? ' said Dai-yu , joining in the good humour . ' A party ? '"
〈 凤姐 道 ： “ 前儿 我 打发 了 丫头 送 了 两瓶 茶叶 去 ， 你 往 那 去 了 ？ ”,"' I sent someone round to you the other day with two caddies-full of tea , said Xi-feng , ' but you were out . '"
林黛玉 笑 道 ： “ 哦 ， 可是 倒 忘 了 ， 多谢 多谢 。 ”,"' Yes , ' said Dai-yu . ' I am sorry : I forgot to thank you . '"
凤姐儿 又 道 ： “ 你 尝 了 可 还 好不好 ？ ”,' Have you tried it ? ' said Xi-feng . ' What did you think of it ? '
没有 说完 ， 宝玉 便 说道 ： “ 论理 可倒 罢了 ， 只是 我 说 不大 甚 好 ， 也 不知 别人 尝 着 怎么样 。 ”,"' I would not ask , if I were you , ' said Bao-yu , chipping in . ' I thought it was rotten . I do not know what the rest of you thought about it . '"
宝钗 道 ： “ 味 倒 轻 ， 只是 颜色 不大 好些 。 ”,"' I thought the flavour was all right , ' said Bao-chai . ' The colour was not up to much . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 那 是 暹罗 国 进贡 来 的 。 我 尝 着 也 没什么 趣儿 ， 还 不如 我 每日 吃 的 呢 。 ”,"' That was tribute tea from Siam , ' said Xi-feng . ' I did not like it at all . I thought it was not as nice as the tea we drink every day . '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 我 吃 着 好 ， 不知 你们 的 脾胃 是 怎样 ？ ”,"' Oh , I quite liked it , ' said Dai-yu . ' Your palates must be more sensitive than mine . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 果然 爱 吃 ， 把 我 这个 也 拿 了 去 吃 罢 。 ”,"' If you really like it , ' said Bao-yu , ' you are welcome to have mine . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 要 爱 吃 ， 我 那里 还有 呢 。 ”,"' I have still got quite a bit left , ' said Xi-feng . ' If you really like it , you can have it all . '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 果真 的 ， 我 就 打发 丫头 取去 了 。 ”,"' Thank you very much , ' said Dai-yu . ' I will send someone round to fetch it . '"
凤姐 道 ： “ 不用 取 去 ， 我 打发 人 送来 就是 了 。,"' No , do not do that , ' said Xi-feng . ' I will send it round to you ."
我 明儿 还有 一件 事求 你 ， 一同 打发 人 送来 。 ” 〉,There is something I want you to do for me . The person I send round about it can bring the tea as well . '
黛玉 听 了 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你们 听听 ： 这 是 吃 了 他 一点 子 茶叶 ， 就 使 唤起 人 来 了 。 ”,"Dai-yu laughed mockingly : ' Do you hear that , everybody ? Because she is given me a bit of her old tea , I have to start doing odd jobs for her . '"
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 既 吃 了 我们 家 的 茶 ， 怎么 还 不 给 我们 家 作 媳妇儿 ？ ”,"' That is fair enough , ' said Xi-feng . ' You know the rule : "" drink the family 's tea , the family 's bride-to-be "" ! '"
众人 都 大笑 起来 。 黛玉 涨红了脸 ， 回过 头 去 ， 一声 儿 不 言语 。,"Everyone laughed at this except Dai-yu , who turned her head away , blushing furiously , and said nothing"
〈 李宫裁 笑 向宝钗 道 ： “ 真真 我们 二 婶子 的 诙谐 是 好 的 。 ”,"' Cousin Feng will have her little joke , ' Li Wan observed to Bao-chai with a smile ."
黛玉 道 ： “ 什么 诙谐 ！ 不过 是 贫嘴贱舌 的 讨人厌 罢了 ！ ”,"' Do you call that a joke ? ' said Dai-yu . ' It was a silly , idle remark , and very irritating . '"
〈 说 着 便 啐 了 一口 。,She gave a snort of disgust by way of reinforcement .
凤姐 笑 道 ： “ 你 别 作梦 ！ 你 给 我们 家 做 了 媳妇 ， 少 什么 ？ ” 〉 指着 宝玉 道 ： “ 你 瞧瞧 人物 儿 配不上 ？ 门第 儿 配不上 ？ 根基 儿 家私 儿 配不上 ？ 那 一点儿 玷辱 你 ？ ”,"Xi-feng laughed : ' What is so irritating about it ? Look at him ! ' - She pointed at Bao-yu - ' Is not he good enough for you ? Good looks , good family good income . There are no snags that I can see . It is a perfect match ! '"
黛玉 起身 便 走 。,Dai-yu rose and fled .
宝钗 叫 道 ： “ 颦 儿 急 了 ， 还 不 回来 呢 ！ 走 了 倒 没意思 。 ”,"' Oh , Frowner 's in a rage ! Come back Frowner ! ' Bao-chai called out after her . ' If you go , it will spoil all the fun . '"
说 着 ， 站 起来 拉 住 。,She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back .
才 到 房门 ， 只见 赵姨娘 和 周姨娘 两个 人 都 来 瞧 宝玉 ， 〈 李宫裁 、 宝钗 、 宝玉 等 都 让 他 两个 坐 。 独凤姐 只 和 林黛玉 说 笑 ， 正眼 也 不 看 他们 。 〉,"At the doorway they ran into Jia Zheng 's two concubines , Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou , come to see Bao-yu . Li Wan , Bao-chai and Bao-yu made them welcome and invited them to sit down and talk , but Xi-feng and Dai-yu conversed with each other and rather pointedly ignored them ."
宝钗正 欲 说话 ， 只见 王夫人 房里 的 丫头 来说 ： “ 舅 太太 来 了 ， 请 奶奶 姑娘 们 过去 呢 。 ”,Bao-chai was in the middle of saying something to the rest of the group when a maid arrived from Lady Wang 's to say that Wang Zi-teng 's wife had come and the presence of the young ladies was requested .
李 纨 连忙 同着 凤姐儿 走 了 。,Li Wan and Xi-feng rose to go .
赵周 两 人 也 都 出去 了 。,Aunt Zhao and Aunt Zhou hurriedly took their leave .
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 不能 出去 ， 你们 好歹 别 叫 舅母 进来 。 ” 又 说 ： “ 林妹妹 ， 你 略 站 站 ， 我 和 你 说话 。 ”,"' I can not go out , ' said Bao-yu . ' For heaven 's sake do not let Aunt Wang come over here ! - Cousin Lin ! ' he called to Dai-yu . ' Stay here a bit ! There is something I want to say to you . '"
凤姐 听 了 ， 回头 向黛玉 道 ： “ 有人 叫 你 说话 呢 ， 回去 罢 。 ”,"Hearing him , Xi-feng turned back to address Dai-yu : ' Do you hear that ? Someone wants a word with you . You would better go back and see what he wants to say ! '"
便 把 黛玉 往后 一 推 ， 和 李 纨笑着 去 了 。,"She gave her a push in the direction of the house ; then she and Li Wan went off , both laughing"
这里 宝玉 拉 了 黛玉 的 手 ， 只是 笑 ， 又 不 说话 。,"When they were alone together , Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand . He smiled and smiled , but said nothing ."
黛玉 不觉 又 红了脸 ， 挣 着 要 走 。,"Dai-yu felt herself blushing , and tried to break away ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 暧哟 ！ 好 头疼 ！ ”,' Aiyo ! ' he said . ' My head ! '
黛玉 道 ： “ 该 ！ 阿弥陀佛 ！ ”,' Good ! ' said Dai-yu . ' It serves you right ! '
宝玉 大叫 一声 ， 将 身一跳 ， 离 地 有 三四尺 高 ， 口 内乱 嚷 ， 尽 是 胡话 。,"Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry , jumped two or three feet into the air , and began to shout and babble deliriously ."
黛玉 并 众 丫鬟 都 唬 慌 了 ， 忙 报知 王夫人 与 贾母 。,Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia .
此时 王子腾 的 夫人 也 在 这里 ， 都 一齐 来看 。,Wang Zi-teng 's lady was with them and hurried over with the rest to see him .
宝玉 一发 拿刀弄杖 、 寻死觅活 的 ， 闹 的 天翻地覆 。,By the time they arrived he had already tried several times to kill himself and was raving like a madman .
贾母王 夫人 一 见 ， 唬 的 抖衣乱战 ， “ 儿 ” 一声 “ 肉 ” 一声 ， 放声大哭 。,"His mother and grandmother were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling . Then , breaking into loud weeping , they cried out to him piteously between their sobs : ' my son ! ' , ' my child ! ' , ' my darling ' !"
于是 惊动 了 众人 ， 连贾 赦 、 邢夫人 、 贾珍 、 贾政 并 琏 、 蓉 、 芸 、 萍 、 薛姨妈 、 薛蟠 并 周瑞家 的 一干 家中 上下 人 等 并 丫鬟 媳妇 等 ， 都 来 园内 看视 ， 登时 乱麻 一般 。,"Soon the news had spread to the other parts of the Rong household and to the household next door and Jia She , Lady Xing , Cousin Zhen , Jia Zheng , Jia Lian , Jia Rong , Jia Yun , Jia Ping , Aunt Xue and Xue Pan - not to mention Zhou Rui 's wife and a great bevy of domestics both high and low - came hurrying into the garden , adding numbers and confusion to the group of helpless spectators ."
正 没 个 主意 ， 只见 凤姐 手持 一把 明晃晃 的 刀 ， 砍进 园 来 ， 见 鸡 杀鸡 ， 见 犬 杀 犬 ， 见 了 人 ， 瞪 着眼 就要 杀人 。 众人 一 发慌 了 。 周瑞家 的 带 着 几个 力 大 的 女人 ， 上去 抱住 ， 夺 了 刀 ， 抬回 房中 。,"While they were still wondering what to do with Bao-yu , Xi-feng appeared , brandishing a gleaming knife in one hand and attacking whatever came in her path . She had already massacred several luckless dogs and hens and now , seeing people ahead , glared at them madly and would have rushed upon them too had not Zhou Rui 's wife and a few hefty and resourceful women servants advanced upon her while the others looked on helplessly , clasped her about the arms and body , wrested the knife from her hand , and carried her off to her room ."
〈 平儿 丰儿 等 哭 的 泪天泪 地 。,Patience and Felicity wept piteously to see their mistress in such a state .
贾政 等 心中 也 有些 烦难 。 顾 了 这里 ， 丢 不下 那里 。,"On this occasion even Jia Zheng 's customary impassivity seemed to have deserted him , as he turned this way and that , uncertain on whom to direct his attention ."
别人 慌张 自 不必 讲 ， 独有 薛蟠 更 比 诸人 忙 到 十分 去 ： 又 恐 薛姨妈 被 人 挤 倒 ， 又 恐 薛宝钗 被 人 瞧见 ， 又 恐 香菱 被 人 臊 皮 — — 知道 贾珍 等 是 在 女人 身上 做 功夫 的 ， 因此 忙 的 不堪 。,"And if Jia Zheng was distraught , the state of the others can be imagined . Most remarkable , perhaps , was the spectacle of Xue Pan fussing over his womenfolk , one moment afraid that his mother would be jostled in the crush , the next that Bao-chai might be ogled or Caltrop glad-eyed by some wanton male . Cousin Zhen , he knew for a fact , was a notorious womanizer ."
忽 一眼 瞥见 了 林黛玉 风流 婉转 ， 已 酥 倒 在 那里 。,Then he caught sight of Dai-yu ( whom he had never seen before ) and forgot his anxiety in gawping admiration of that ethereal beauty .
当下 众人 七言八语 ， 有 的 说 请 端公 送祟 的 ， 有 的 说 请 巫婆 跳神 的 ， 有的 又 荐 玉皇阁 的 张真人 ， 种种 喧腾 不 一 。 也 曾 百般 医治 祈祷 ， 问卜 求神 ， 总 无 效验 。,"Although no one knew what to do themselves , there were a great many opinions about what ought to be done . Some said an exorcist should be called in to expel the malignant spirits , some that it required a dancing medium to draw them out , some offered charm-sheets invoking the demon-quelling powers of the Heavenly Master and issued under the hand of the Taoist pontiff ; yet in spite of prayers , incantations , divination , and all the expedients that faith and physic could provide , there was no visible improvement in the condition of the patients ."
看看 日落 ， 王子腾 夫人 告辞 去后 ， ｛ 次日 又 来 瞧 问 。 ｝,At sundown Wang Zi-teng 's lady took her leave and went home . Next day she made another visit to inquire after them .
接着 小史 侯家 、 邢夫人 弟兄 辈 并 各 亲戚 眷属 都 来 瞧 看 ， 也 有 送 符水 的 ， 也 有荐 僧道 的 ， 总 不 见效 。,"This was followed by visits from the wife of Grandmother Jia 's nephew the Marquis , from Lady Xing 's brothers ' wives , and from the wives of other marriage connections of the family . Bottled charm-water , wonder-working monks and Taoists and highly recommended physicians were also sent round to the mansion by various friends and relations ."
他 叔嫂 二人 ， 愈发 糊涂 ， 不省人事 ， 睡 在 床上 ， 浑身 火炭 一般 ， 口内 无般 不 说 。,But the cousins continued delirious and lay on their beds burning with fever and babbling incomprehensibly .
到 夜晚 间 ， 那些 婆娘 媳妇 丫头 们 都 不敢 上前 。,"At nightfall they became even worse , so that the maids and even the older women no longer dared go near them ."
因此 把 他 二人 都 抬到 王夫人 的 上房 内 ， 夜间 派 了 贾芸 带 着 小厮 们 挨次 轮班看守 。,The two of them had to be carried into Lady Wang 's room on their beds and set down there side by side so that Jia Yun and a group of pages could watch over them in shifts throughout the night .
贾母 、 王夫人 、 邢夫人 并 薛姨妈 寸步不离 ， 只 围着 干哭 。 〉,"Grandmother Jia , Lady Wang , Lady Xing and Aunt Xue stayed near at hand , refusing to budge , though unable to do anything but sit by and weep ."
此时 贾 赦 贾政又 恐 哭坏 了 贾母 ， 日夜 熬油费火 ， 闹 的 上下 不安 。,"Jia She and Jia Zheng , afraid that their mother 's health would suffer , displayed their concern by keeping themselves and everyone else up throughout most of the night . There were lights burning everywhere and hardly anyone slept at all"
贾 赦还 各处 去 寻觅 僧道 。,Jia She continued to hunt everywhere for monks and exorcists reputed able to cure diseases of the mind .
贾 政见 不 效验 ， 因 阻贾 赦道 ： “ 儿女 之 数 ， 总由 天命 ， 非 人力 可强 。,"Finally , Jia Zheng , who saw that their methods were all useless , lost patience with him and tried to make him stop : ' Young people will die if they must . Nothing can alter fate ."
他 二人 之病 ， 百般 医治 不效 ， 想 是 天意 该 如此 ； 也 只好 由他去 。 ”,And that they are fated to die would appear from the fact that all efforts to cure them have been unavailing . I think we should allow them to die in peace . '
贾 赦 不理 ， 仍 是 百般 忙乱 。,"But Jia She took no notice , and the commotion continued as before ."
看看 三日 的 光阴 ， 凤姐 宝玉 躺 在 床上 ， 连 气息 都 微 了 ； 合家 都 说 没了 指望 了 ， 忙 的 将 他 二人 的 后事 都 治 备下 了 。,By the third day the patients were so weakened that they lay on their beds motionless and their breathing was scarcely perceptible . The whole family had by now abandoned hope and were already making preparations for their laying-out .
贾母 、 王夫人 、 贾琏 、 平儿 、 袭 人 等 更 哭 的 死去活来 。,"Grandmother Jia , Lady Wang , Jia Lian , Patience and Aroma had cried themselves into a state bordering on prostration ."
只有 赵姨娘 外面 假作 忧愁 ， 心中 称愿 。,Only Aunt Zhao was cheerful - though she did her best to look miserable .
至 第四日 早 ， 宝玉 忽 睁开眼 向 贾母 说道 ： “ 从今 已后 ， 我 可不 在 你家 了 ， 快 打发 我 走 罢 。 ”,Early on the fourth day Bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to Grandmother Jia : ' From now on I can no longer stay in this family . You must get my things ready and let me go . '
贾母 听见 这话 ， 如同 摘 了 心肝 一般 。 赵姨娘 在 旁 劝道 ： “ 老太太 也 不必 过于 悲痛 ： 哥儿 已 是 不中用 了 ， 不如 把 哥儿 的 衣服 穿 好 ， 让 他 早些 回去 ， 也 省 他 受 些 苦 ， 只管 舍不得 他 ， 这 口气 不断 ， 他 在 那里 ， 也 受罪 不安 … … ”,"To the old lady the words were a tearing of heart from body ; but Aunt Zhao , who also heard them , had the temerity to urge their acceptance : ' Your Ladyship should not take it so hard . It is already all up with the boy . We should be getting his graveclothes ready so that he can go in peace . It will be better that way . If we will not let him go now , when he is ready , it will only make more suffering for him in the world to come . . . '"
这些 话 没 说完 ， 被 贾母 照脸 碎 了 一口 唾沫 ， 骂 道 ： “ 烂 了 舌头 的 混账 老婆 ！,"She would have gone on , but Grandmother Jia spat in her face . No empty gesture : it was a full gob of spittle . ' Evil woman ! May your tongue rot !"
怎么 见得 不中用 了 ？ 你 愿意 他 死 了 ， 有 什么 好处 ？ 你 别 作梦 ！ 他 死 了 ， 我 只 合 你们 要命 ！,"How do you know it is all up with him ? You want him to die , do not you ? But if you think you will gain by his death , you must be dreaming ; because if he does die , I shall hold you responsible ."
都 是 你们 素日 调唆 着 ， 逼 他 念书 写字 ， 把 胆子 唬 破 了 ， 见 了 他 老子 就 象 个 ‘ 避 猫 鼠 儿 ’ 一样 。,It is your spiteful meddling that has forced him to do all this studying . You have reduced the poor child to such a state that the mere sight of his father makes him more scared than a mouse with the cat after it .
都 不是 你们 这 起 小妇 调唆 的 ！,"You have done this , you and the others of your kind ."
这 会子 逼死 了 他 ， 你们 就 随 了 心 了 ！,"And now I suppose , if you succeed in murdering him , you will be satisfied ."
— — 我 饶 那 一个 ？ ”,But do not imagine you will escape me - any of you ! '
一面 哭 ， 一面 骂 。,She railed and wept .
贾政 在 旁 听见 这些 话 ， 心里 越发 着急 ， 忙 喝退 了 赵姨娘 ， 委宛 劝解 了 一番 。,"Jia Zheng was close at hand while she was saying all this and was deeply distressed by it . Peremptorily dismissing the concubine , he tried to calm his mother and reasoned against the injustice of her charges ."
忽 有人 来回 ： “ 两口 棺木 都 做 齐 了 。 ”,It was unfortunate that just at that moment a servant should have come in to announce that the two coffins that had been ordered were now ready .
贾母 〈 听 了 ， 如 火上浇油 一般 ， 〉 一发 哭 着 大 骂 ， 问 ： “ 是 谁 叫做 的 棺材 ？,The words were as oil upon fire . The old lady blazed . ' Who gave orders for those coffins to be made ?
快 把 做 棺材 的 人 拿来 打死 ！ ”,Where is the man who made them ? Go and get the man who made those coffins ! Flog him to death ! '
闹 了 个 天翻地覆 。 忽 听见 空中 隐隐 有 木鱼 声 ， 念 了 一句 “ 南 无解 冤 解结 菩萨 ！ — — 有 那 人口 不利 、 家宅 不安 、 中 邪祟 、 逢 凶险 的 ， 找 我们 医治 。 ”,"Suddenly , as she raged and stormed , the faint tock tock of a holy man 's wooden fish was heard upon the air and a high monotone chant that kept time with the beat : ' Na-mah A-mi-ta-bha Bo-dhi-satt-va ! Mer-ci-ful de-li-w-rer ! All a-fflic-ted and tor-men-ted , dAll a-ttacked by e-vil spi-rits . All de-mo-ni-ac po-sse-ssion , I cure . I cure , I cure . '"
贾母王 夫人 都 听见 了 ， 便 命 人 向 街上 找寻 去 。,Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang at once sent someone into the street to see who it was .
原来 是 一个 癞 和尚 同一个 跛 道士 。,The source of the chanting proved to be a disreputable-looking Buddhist monk .
那 和尚 是 怎的 模样 ？ 但 见 ：,Stone describes him in the following quatrain :
鼻 如 悬胆两眉长 ，,"A bottle nose he had and shaggy brows ,"
目 似 明星 有 宝光 ；,Through which peeped eyes that twinkled like bright stars .
破 衲 芒 鞋 无 住迹 ，,"His robe was patched and torn , his feet straw-shod ,"
腌臜 更 有 一头 疮 。,His unclean pate blotched with unsightly scars .
那道人 是 如何 模样 ？ 看 他时 ：,"He was accompanied by a lame Taoist , for whom a similar quatrain has been supplied by our poetical Stone :"
一足 高来 一足 低 ，,"Up , down he hopped on his unequal legs ,"
浑身 带水 又 拖泥 ；,From mud and puddle not a stitch left dry .
相逢 若 问家 何处 ，,"Yet , if you asked him where his duelling was ,"
却 在 蓬莱 弱水 西 。,' Westward of Paradise ' he would reply .
贾政因 命人 请进来 ， 问 他 二人 ： “ 在 何山 修道 ？ ”,Jia Zheng had them invited in and asked them what monastery they were from .
那僧笑 道 ： “ 长官 不消 多 话 ， 因 知府 上 人口 欠安 ， 特 来 医治 的 。 ”,The monk was genially dismissive : ' There is no need for Your Worship to waste time on formalities . Suffice it to say that I heard you had sickness in this house and have come to cure it . '
贾政道 ： “ 有 两个 人 中 了 邪 ， 不知 有何 仙 方可 治 ？ ”,"' Two members of this family have , indeed , fallen victims to some kind of witchcraft , ' said Jia Zheng . ' Might one inquire what charm you intend to cure them with ? '"
那道人 笑 道 ： “ 你家 现有 希世之宝 ， 可治 此病 ， 何须 问方 ！ ”,' Charm ? ' The monk laughed . ' You already possess in your own house a precious object capable of curing them . What other charm is necessary ? '
贾政心 中 便 动 了 ， 因道 ： “ 小儿 生时 虽 带 了 一块 玉来 ， 上面 刻 着 ‘ 能除 凶邪 ’ ， 然 亦 未 见 灵效 。 ”,"Jia Zheng gave a start . ' To be sure . My son was born with a piece of jade whose inscription makes some such claim - "" Dispels the harms of witchcraft "" . But as you see , it does not appear to possess the power it lays claim to . '"
那僧道 ： “ 长官 有所不知 。 那 ‘ 宝玉 ’ 原是 灵 的 ， 只 因为 声色货利 所迷 ， 故此 不灵 了 。 今 将 此 宝 取出 来 ， 待 我 持诵 持诵 ， 自然 依旧 灵 了 。 ”,"' That is because the world and its temptations have confused it , ' said the monk . ' It certainly used to have the power . If you will have the goodness to fetch it for me and allow me to hold it in my hand and say a wee prayer over it , I think I can undertake to bring the power back again . '"
贾政便 向宝玉 项上 取下 那块 玉 来 ， 递 与 他 二人 。,"Jia Zheng took the Magic Jade from Bao-yu 's neck and handed it to the monk , who held it on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a sigh :"
那 和尚 擎 在 掌上 ， 长叹一声 ， 道 ： “ 青埂峰 下 ， 别 来 十三载 矣 ！,"' Thirteen years , old friend , since we first met under Green-sickness Peak !"
人世 光阴 迅速 ， 尘缘 未断 ， 奈何 奈何 ！,"Time certainly flies . But you have not finished with this world yet , you know ."
可羡 你 当日 那段 好处 ：,"Dear , dear , dear ! You are not the Stone you were , are you ?"
天 不拘 兮 地 不羁 ，,"- Time was you lived in perfect liberty ,"
心头 无喜亦无悲 ；,"Your heart alike from joy and sorrow free ,"
只 因 锻炼 通灵 后 ，,"Till , by the smeller 's alchemy transformed ,"
便 向 人间 惹是非 。,Into the world you came to purchase misery .
可惜 今日 这 番 经历 呵 ：,"By the bye , I am sorry you have been having such a disagreeable experience these last few days ."
粉渍 脂痕 污宝 光 ，,- Vain sensual joys the jade 's sheen have besmirched ;
房 栊 日夜 困 鸳鸯 ；,"The poor bird droops , in its close prison perched ."
沉酣 一梦 终须 醒 ，,From drunken dreaming one day you will recover :
冤债 偿清 好 散场 。 ”,"Then , when all debts are paid , the play will soon be over . '"
念毕 ， 又 摩弄 了 一回 ， 说 了 些 疯话 ， 递 与 贾政道 ： “ 此物 已 灵 ， 不可 亵渎 ， 悬于 卧室 槛 上 ， 除 〈 亲身 妻母 〉 外 ， 不可 令阴 人 冲犯 。,"When the monk had finished apostrophizing the stone , he rubbed it and polished it between his hands and muttered some strange-sounding words over it . ' There ! Its power has now been restored . ' He handed it back to Jia Zheng . ' But you must be careful that it does not become contaminated again . Hang it above the threshold of the bedroom and let no women apart from the patient 's own mother and grandmother go inside ."
三十三日 之后 ， 包管 好 了 。 ”,"If you will do that , I can guarantee a complete recovery in thirty-three days . '"
贾政忙 命人 让茶 ， 〈 要 送 谢礼 ， 〉 那 二人 已经 走 了 。,"Jia Zheng would have liked to detain the monk for tea and offer him some remuneration , but he and the Taoist slipped quietly away and could not be traced ."
〈 少不得 依言 将 他 二人 就 安放 在 王夫人 卧室 之内 ， 将 玉 悬 在 门上 。,The monk 's directions were scrupulously followed .
王夫人 亲身 守 着 ， 不许 别 个人 进来 。,Lady Wang guarded the doorway in person and prevented any unauthorized person from getting into the bedroom .
至 晚间 他 二人 竟 渐渐 醒来 ， 说 腹中 饥饿 。,By evening the sufferers had regained consciousness and said they were hungry .
贾母 、 王夫人 如 得 了 珍宝 一般 ， 旋 熬 了 米汤 与 他 二人 吃 了 。 〉,"This news , so precious to the ears of Lady Jia and Lady Wang , who at once had rice gruel brought in to feed them with , was relayed to the girls in the outer room ."
众 姊妹 都 在 外间 听 消息 ， 黛玉 先 念 了 一声 〈 阿弥陀佛 〉 ， 宝钗笑 而不言 ， 惜春 道 ： “ 宝姐姐 笑 什么 ？ ”,"' Bless His Holy Name ! ' Dai-yu murmured fervently . Bao-chai laughed , but said nothing . The others were mystified . ' Why do you laugh , Cousin Bao ? ' Xi-chun asked her ."
宝钗 道 ： “ 我 笑 如来佛 比人 还 忙 ： 又 要 度化 众生 ； 又 要 保佑 人家 病痛 ， 都 叫 他 速 好 ； 又 要 管 人家 的 婚姻 ， 叫 他 成就 。 — — 你 说 可 忙 不忙 ？ 可 好笑 不好 笑 ？ ”,"' I was thinking how busy He of the Holy Name must be , ' Bao-chai said . ' Apart from working for the salvation of all sentient beings , He has to protect the sick and hasten their recovery - not to mention watching over plighted couples to make sure that they marry and live happily ever after . What a lot He has to keep Him busy ! Do not you find the thought rather amusing ? '"
一时 黛玉 红了脸 ， 碎 了 一口 道 ： “ 你们 都 不是 好人 ！ 再 不 跟着 好 人学 ， 只 跟着 凤丫头 学 的 贫嘴贱舌 的 。 ”,"Dai-yu affected scorn , but was blushing hotly . ' You are all horrid . Instead of following good examples , you all imitate Feng and make nasty , cheap jokes all the time . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 掀帘子 出去 了 。,She raised the portière and went out .
欲 知 端详 ， 下回分解 。,"But if you wish to know more , you will have to wait for the next chapter ."
第二十六回,Chapter 26
蜂腰 桥 设 言传 心事,A conversation on Wasp Waist Bridge is a cover for communication of a different kind
潇湘 馆 春困 发 幽情,And a soliloquy overheard in the Naiad 's House reveals unsuspected depths of feeling
话 说 宝玉 养 过 了 三十三天 之后 ， 不但 身体 强壮 ， 亦且 连 脸上 疮痕 平复 ， 仍 回 大观园 去 。,"By the time the thirty-three days ' convalescence had ended , not only were Bao-yu 's health and strength completely restored , but even the burn-marks on his face had vanished , and he was allowed to move back into the Garden ."
这 也 不在话下 。,
且说 近日 宝玉 病 的 时节 ， 贾芸 带 着 家下 小厮 坐 更 看守 ， 昼夜 在 这里 ， 那小红 同众 丫鬟 也 在 这里 守 着 宝玉 ： 彼此 相见 日 多 ， 渐渐 的 混熟 了 。,"It may be recalled that when Bao-yu 's sickness was at its height , it had been found necessary to call in Jia Yun with a number of pages under his command to take turns in watching over him . Crimson was there too at that time , having been brought in with the other maids from his apartment . During those few days she and Jia Yun therefore had ample opportunity of seeing each other , and a certain familiarity began to grow up between them ."
小红见 贾芸 手里 拿 着 块 绢子 ， 倒 象是 自己 从前 掉 的 ， 待 要 问 他 ， 又 不好 问 。,"Crimson noticed that Jia Yun was often to be seen sporting a handkerchief very much like the one she had lost . She nearly asked him about it , but in the end was too shy ."
不料 那 和尚 道士 来 过 ， 用不着 一切 男人 ， 贾芸 仍 种树 去 了 。,"Then , after the monk 's visit , the presence of the menfolk was no longer required and Jia Yun went back to his tree-planting ."
这件 事 待 放下 又 放不下 ， 待 要 问 去 又 怕人 猜疑 ， 正是 犹 预不决 、 神魂不定 之际 ， 忽 听 窗外 问道 ： “ 姐姐 在 屋里 没有 ？ ”,"Though Crimson could still not dismiss the matter entirely from her mind , she did not ask anyone about it for fear of arousing their suspicions . A day or two after their return to Green Delights , Crimson was sitting in her room , still brooding over this handkerchief business , when a voice outside the window inquired whether she was in ."
小红 闻听 ， 在 窗 眼内 望 外 一看 ， 原来 是 本院 的 个 小丫头 佳 蕙 ， 因 答说 ： “ 在 家里 呢 ， 你 进来 罢 。 ”,"Peeping through an eyelet in the casement she recognized Melilot , a little maid who belonged to the same apartment as herself . ' Yes , I am in , ' she said . ' Come inside ! '"
佳 蕙 听 了 跑 进来 ， 就 坐在 床上 ， 笑 道 ： “ 我 好 造化 ！,Little Melilot came bounding in and sat down on the bed with a giggle . ' I am in luck ! ' she said .
才 在 院子 里 洗 东西 ， 宝玉 叫 往 林姑娘 那里 送 茶叶 ， 花大姐姐 交给 我 送 去 ， 可巧 老太太 给 林姑娘 送 钱 来 ， 正 分给 他们 的 丫头 们 呢 ， 见 我 去 了 ， 林姑娘 就 抓 了 两把 给 我 ， 也 不知 是 多少 ， 你 替 我 收 着 。 ”,"' I was washing some things in the yard when Bao-yu asked for some tea to betaken round to Miss Lin 's for him and Miss Aroma gave me the job of taking it . When I got there , Miss Lin had just been given some money by Her Old Ladyship and was sharing it out among her maids ; so when she saw me she just said "" Here you are ! "" and gave me two big handfuls of it . I have no idea how much it is . Will you look after it for me , please ? '"
便 把 手绢 子 打开 ， 把 钱 倒 出来 交给 小红 。,She undid her handkerchief and poured out a shower of coins .
小红 就 替 他 一五一十 的 数 了 收起 。,Crimson carefully counted them for her and put them away in a safe place .
佳 惠道 ： “ 你 这 两日 心里 到底 觉着 怎么样 ？,' What is been the matter with you lately ? ' said Melilot .
依 我 说 ， 你 竟家 去 住 两日 ， 请 一个 大夫 来 瞧瞧 ， 吃 两剂 药 ， 就 好 了 。 ”,"' If you ask me , I think you ought to go home for a day or two and call in a doctor . I expect you need some medicine . '"
小红道 ： “ 那里 的话 ？ 好好儿 的 ， 家 去 做 什么 ？ ”,' Silly ! ' said Crimson . ' I am perfectly all right . What should I want to go home for ? '
佳 蕙 道 ： “ 我 想 起来 了 。 林姑娘 生 的 弱 ， 时常 他 吃药 ， 你 就 和 他 要 些 来 吃 ， 也 是 一样 。 ”,"' I know what , then , ' said Melilot . ' Miss Lin 's very weakly . She is always taking medicine . Why do not you ask her to give you some of hers ? It would probably do just as well . '"
小红道 ： “ 胡说 ！ 药 也 是 混吃 的 ？ ”,"' Oh , nonsense ! ' said Crimson . ' You can not take other people 's medicines just like that ! '"
佳 蕙 道 ： “ 你 这 也 不是 个长 法儿 ， 又 懒 吃 懒 喝 的 ， 终久 怎么样 ？ ”,"' Well , you can not go on in this way , ' said Melilot , ' never eating or drinking properly . What will become of you ? '"
小红道 ： “ 怕 什么 ？ 还 不如 早些 死 了 倒 干净 ！ ”,' Who cares ? ' said Crimson . ' The sooner I am dead the better ! '
佳 蕙 道 ： “ 好好儿 的 ， 怎么 说 这些 话 ？ ”,"' You should not say such things , ' said Melilot . ' It is not right . '"
小红道 ： “ 你 那里 知道 我 心里 的 事 ！ ”,' Why not ? ' said Crimson . ' How do you know what is on my mind ?
佳 蕙 点头 ， 想 了 一会 道 ： “ 可 也 怨不得 你 。,"Melilot shook her head sympathetically . ' I can not say I really blame you , ' she said ."
这个 地方 ， 本 也 难 站 。,' Things are very difficult here at times .
就 象 昨儿 老太太 因 宝玉 病 了 这些 日子 ， 说 伏侍 的 人 都 辛苦 了 ， 如今 身上 好 了 ， 各处 还 香 了 愿 ， 叫 把 跟着 的 人 都 按着 等 儿 赏 他们 。,"Take yesterday , for example . Her Old Ladyship said that as Bao-yu was better now and there was to be a thanksgiving for his recovery , all those who had the trouble of nursing him during his illness were to be rewarded according to their grades ."
我们 算 年纪 小 ， 上不去 ， 我 也 不 抱怨 ； 象 你 怎么 也 不算 在 里头 ？ 我 心里 就 不服 。,"Well now , I can understand the very young ones like me not being included , but why should they leave you out ? I felt really sorry for you when I heard that they would left you out ."
袭 人 那 怕 他 得 十分 儿 ， 也 不恼 他 ， 原该 的 。,"Aroma , of course , you would expect to get more than anyone else . I do not blame her at all . In fact , I think it is owing to her ."
说 句 良心话 ， 谁 还 能比 他 呢 ？,Let's be honest : none of us can compare with Aroma .
别说 他 素日 殷勤 小心 ， 就是 不 殷勤 小心 ， 也 拼 不得 。,"I mean , even if she did not always take so much trouble over everything , no one would want to quarrel about her having a bigger share ."
只 可气 睛 雯 绮霞 他们 这 几个 都 算 在 上 等 里 去 ， 仗 着 宝玉 疼 他们 ， 众人 就 都 捧 着 他们 。,What makes me so angry is that people like Skybright and Mackerel should count as top grade when everyone knows they are only put there to curry favour with Bao-yu .
你 说 可气 不可 气 ？ ”,Does not it make you angry ? '
小红道 ： “ 也 犯不着 气 他们 。,"' I do not see much point in getting angry , ' said Crimson ."
俗语说 的 ： ‘ 千里 搭长 棚 — — 没有 个 不散 的 筵席 。 ’,"' You know what they said about the mile-wide marquee : "" Even the longest party must have an end "" ?"
谁 守 一辈子 呢 ？,"Well , none of us is here for ever , you know ."
不过 三年五载 ， 各人 干 各人 的 去 了 ； 那时 谁 还管 谁 呢 ？ ”,Another four or five years from now when we have each gone our different ways it will not matter any longer what all the rest of us are doing . '
这 两句话 不觉 感动 了佳蕙 心肠 ， 由不得 眼圈儿 红 了 ， 又 不好意思 无端 的 哭 ， 只得 勉强 笑 道 ： “ 你 这话 说 的 是 。 昨儿 宝玉 还 说 ： 明儿 怎么 收拾 房子 ， 怎么 做 衣裳 。 倒 象 有 几百年 熬煎 似的 。 ”,"Little Melilot found this talk of parting and impermanence vaguely affecting and a slight moisture was to be observed about her eyes . She thought shame to cry without good cause , however , and masked her emotion with a smile : ' That is perfectly true . Only yesterday Bao-yu was going on about all the things he is going to do to his rooms and the clothes he is going to have made and everything , just as if he had a hundred or two years ahead of him with nothing to do but kill time in . '"
小红 听 了 ， 冷笑 两声 ， 方要 说话 ， 只见 一个 未留 头 的 小丫头 走进 来 ， 手里 拿 看 些 花 样子 并 两张 纸 ， 说道 ： “ 这 两个 花 样子 叫 你 描出来 呢 。 ”,"Crimson laughed scornfully , though whether at Melilot 's simplicity or at Bao-yu 's improvidence is unclear , since just as she was about to comment , a little maid came running in , so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl 's horns . She was carrying some patterns and sheets of paper . ' You are to copy out these two patterns . '"
说 着 ， 向小红 撂下 ， 回 转身 就 跑 了 。,She threw them in Crimson 's direction and straightway darted out again .
小红 向 外 问道 ： “ 到底 是 谁 的 ？ 也等不 的 说完 就 跑 。 ‘ 谁 蒸下 馒头 等 着 你 — — 怕冷 了 不成 ？ ’ ”,"Crimson shouted after her : ' Who are they for , then ? You might at least finish your message before rushing off . What are you in such a tearing hurry about ? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for you and you are afraid they will get cold ? '"
那 小丫头 在 窗外 只 说 得 一声 ： “ 是 绮大 姐姐 的 。 ” 抬起 脚来 ， “ 咕咚咕咚 ” 又 跑 了 。,"' They are for Mackerel . ' The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer through the window , then picking up her heels , went pounding off , plim-plam , plim-plam , plim-plam , as fast as she had come ."
小红 便 赌气 把 那 样子 撂 在 一边 ， 向 抽屉 内 找 笔 ， 找 了 半天 ， 都 是 秃 的 ， 因 说道 ： “ 前儿 一枝 新 笔 放在 那里 了 ？ 怎么 想不起来 ？ … … ”,"Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a brush to trace them with . After rummaging for several minutes she had only succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones , too moulted for use . ' Funny ! ' she said . ' I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day . . . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 出神 ， 想 了 一回 ， 方笑 道 ： “ 是 了 ， 前儿 晚上 莺 儿 拿 了 去 了 。 ”,"She thought a bit , then laughed at herself as she remembered : ' Of course . Oriole took it , the evening before last . '"
因 向佳蕙 道 ： “ 你 替 我 取 了 来 。 ”,"She turned to Melilot . ' Would you go and get it for me , then ? '"
佳 蕙 道 ： “ 花大姐姐 还 等 着 我 替 他 拿 箱子 ， 你 自己 取去 罢 。 ”,"' I am afraid I can not , ' said Melilot . ' Miss Aroma 's waiting for me to fetch some boxes for her . You will have to get it yourself . '"
小红道 ： “ 他 等 着 你 ， 你 还 坐 着 闲磕牙 儿 ？,"' If Aroma 's waiting for you , why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time ? ' said Crimson ."
我 不 叫 你 取去 ， 他 也 不 ‘ 等 ‘ 你 了 。 坏透 了 的 小 蹄子 ！ ”,"' If I had not asked you to go and get it , she would not have been waiting , would she ? Lazy little beast ! '"
说 着 自己 便 出 房 来 。 出 了 怡红院 ， 一 径 往 宝钗 院内 来 。,She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of Bao-chai 's courtyard .
刚至 沁 芳 亭 畔 ， 只见 宝玉 的 奶娘 李嬷嬷 从 那边 来 。 小红 立住 ， 笑 问道 ： “ 李 奶奶 ， 你 老人家 那里 去 了 ， 怎么 打 这里 来 ？ ”,"She was just passing by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when she caught sight of Bao-yu 's old wet-nurse , Nannie Li , coming from the opposite direction and stood respectfully aside to wait for her . ' Where have you been , Mrs Li ? ' she asked her ."
李嬷嬷 站住 ， 将手 一 拍 ， 道 ： “ 你 说 ， 好好儿 的 ， 又 看上 了 那个 什么 ‘ 云 哥儿 ’ ’ 雨 哥儿 ’ 的 ， 这 会子 逼 着 我 叫 了 他 来 。 明儿 叫 上 屋里 听见 ， 可 又 是 不好 。 ”,"' I did not expect to see you here . ' Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand : ' What do you think , my dear : His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who does the tree-planting - "" Yin "" or "" Yun "" or whatever his name is - so Nannie has to go and ask him in . Let's hope Their Ladyships do not find out about it . There will be trouble if they do . '"
小红笑 道 ： “ 你 老人家 当真 的 就信 着 他 去 叫 么 ？ ”,' Are you really going to ask him in ? '
李嬷嬷 道 ： “ 可 怎么样 呢 ？ ”,' Yes . Why ? '
小红笑 道 ： “ 那 一个 要是 知 好歹 ， 就 不 进来 才 是 。 ”,"Crimson laughed : ' If your Mr Yun knows what is good for him , he will not agree to come . '"
李嬷嬷 道 ： “ 他 又 不 傻 ， 为什么 不 进来 ？ ”,"' He is no fool , ' said Nannie Li. ' Why should not he ? '"
小红道 ： “ 既 是 进来 ， 你 老人家 该 别 和 他 一块儿 来 ， 回来 叫 他 一个 人 混 磞 ， 看 他 怎么样 ！ ”,"' Any way , if he does come in , ' said Crimson , ignoring her question , ' you can not just bring him in and then leave him , Mrs Li. You will have to take him back again yourself afterwards . You do not want him wandering off on his own . There is no knowing who he might bump into . '"
,"( Crimson herself , was the secret hope . )"
李嬷嬷 道 ： “ 我 有 那们 大 工夫 和 他 走 ！ 不过 告诉 了 他 ， 回来 打发 个 小丫头 子 ， 或是 老婆子 ， 带进 他 来 就 完 了 。 ”,"' Gracious me ! I haven ' t got that much spare time , ' said Nannie Li. ' All I have done is just to tell him that he is got to come . I will send someone else to fetch him in when I get back presently - one of the girls , or one of the older women , maybe . '"
说 着 拄着 拐一径 去 了 。 小红 听说 ， 便 站 着 出神 ， 且 不 去取 笔 。,"She hobbled off on her stick , leaving Crimson standing there in a muse , her mission to fetch the tracing-brush momentarily forgotten ."
不多时 ， 只见 一个 小丫头 跑 来 ， 见 小 红站 在 那里 ， 便 问道 ： “ 红姐姐 ， 你 在 这里 作 什么 呢 ？ ”,"She was still standing there a minute or two later when a little maid came along , who , seeing that it was Crimson , asked her what she was doing there ."
小红 抬头 见 是 小丫头 子 坠儿 。,"Crimson looked up . It was Trinket , another of the maids from Green Delights ."
小红道 ： “ 那里 去 ？ ”,' Where are you going ? ' Crimson asked her .
坠儿 道 ： “ 叫 我 带进 芸 二爷 来 。 ”,"' I have been sent to fetch Mr Yun , ' said Trinket . ' I have to bring him inside to meet Master Bao . '"
说 着 ， 一 径 跑 了 。,She ran off on her way .
这里 小红刚 走 至 蜂腰 桥 门前 ， 只见 那边 坠儿 引着 贾芸 来 了 。,"At the gate to Wasp Waist Bridge Crimson ran into Trinket again , this time with Jia Yun in tow ."
那 贾芸 一面 走 ， 一面 拿 眼 把 小红 一溜 ； 那小红 只 装 着 和 坠儿 说话 ， 也 把 眼去 一溜 贾芸 ： 四目 恰好 相对 。 小红 不觉 把 脸 一 红 ， 一 扭身 往 蘅 芜院 去 了 。,"His eyes sought Crimson 's ; and hers , as she made pretence of conversing with Trinket , sought his . Their two pairs of eyes met and briefly skirmished ; then Crimson felt herself blushing , and turning away abruptly , she made off for Allspice Court ."
不在话下 。 这里 贾芸 随着 坠儿 逶迤 来 至 怡红院 中 ， 坠儿 先进 去 回明 了 ， 然后 方领 贾芸 进去 。,Our narrative now follows Jia Yun and Trinket along the winding pathway to the House of Green Delights . Soon they were at the courtyard gate and Jia Yun waited outside while she went in to announce his arrival . She returned presently to lead him inside .
贾芸 看 时 ， 只见 院内 略略 有 几点 山石 ， 种着 芭蕉 ， 那边 有 两只 仙鹤 ， 在 松树 下剔 翎 。,"There were a few scattered rocks in the courtyard and some clumps of jade-green plantain . Two storks stood in the shadow of a pine-tree , preening themselves with their long bills ."
一溜 回廊 上吊 着 各色 笼子 ， 笼 着 仙禽 异鸟 。,"The gallery surrounding the courtyard was hung with cages of unusual design in which perched or fluttered a wide variety of birds , some of them gay-plumaged exotic ones ."
上面 小小 五间 抱厦 ， 一色 雕镂 新鲜 花样 槅 扇 ， 上面 悬 着 一个 匾 ， 四个 大字 ， 题道 是 ： “ 怡红 快 绿 ” 。,"Above the steps was a little five-frame penthouse building with a glimpse of delicately-carved partitions visible through the open doorway , above which a horizontal board hung , inscribed with the words CRIMSON JOYS AND GREEN DELIGHTS"
贾芸 想道 ： “ 怪 道 叫 ‘ 怡红院 ’ ， 原来 匾 上 是 这 四个 字 。 ”,"So that is why it is called "" The House of Green Delights "" ' Jia Yun told himself . ' The name is taken from the inscription . '"
正 想着 ， 只 听 里面 隔 着 纱窗 子笑 说道 ： “ 快进来 罢 ！ 我 怎么 就 忘 了 你 两三个 月 ！ ”,A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements : ' Come on in ! It must be two or three months since I first forgot our appointment ! '
贾芸 听见 是 宝玉 的 声音 ， 连忙 进入 房内 ， 抬头 一 看 ， 只见 金碧辉煌 ， 文章 熌 烁 ， 却 看不见 宝玉 在 那里 。,"Jia Yun recognized the voice as Bao-yu 's and hurried up the steps inside . He looked about him , dazzled by the brilliance of gold and semi-precious inlay-work and the richness of the ornaments and furnishings , but unable to see Bao-yu in the midst of it all ."
一 回头 ， 只见 左边 立 着 一架 大 穿衣镜 ， 从 镜 后 转出 两个 一对 儿 十五六岁 的 丫头 来 ， 说 ： “ 请 二爷 里头 屋里 坐 。 ”,"To the left of him was a full-length mirror from behind which two girls now emerged , both about fifteen or sixteen years old and of much the same build and height . They addressed him by name and asked him to come inside ."
贾芸 连正眼 也 不敢 看 ， 连忙 答应 了 ， 又 进 一道 碧纱 厨 ， 只见 小小 一张 填 漆 床上 ， 悬 着 大红 销金 撒花 帐子 。,"Slightly overawed , he muttered something in reply and hurried after them , not daring to take more than a furtive glance at them from the corner of his eye . They ushered him into a tent-like summer ' cabinet ' of green net , whose principal furniture was a tiny lacquered bed with crimson hangings heavily patterned in gold ."
宝玉 穿着 家常 衣服 ， 靸 着 鞋 ， 倚 在 床上 ， 拿 着 本书 ； 看见 他 进来 ， 将书 掷 下 ， 早 带笑 立 起身 来 。,"On this Bao-yu , wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers , was reclining , book in hand . He threw the book down as Jia Yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming smile ."
贾芸忙 上前 请 了 安 ， 宝玉 让 坐 ， 便 在 下面 一张 椅子 上 坐 了 。,"Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting . Bidden to sit , he modestly placed himself on a bedside chair ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 只 从 那个 月 见 了 你 ， 我 叫 你 往 书房 里 来 ， 谁知 接接 连连 许多 事情 ， 就 把 你 忘 了 。 ”,"' After I invited you round to my study that day , ' said Bao-yu , ' a whole lot of things seemed to happen one after the other , and I am afraid I quite forgot about your visit . '"
贾芸笑 道 ： “ 总是 我 没造化 ， 偏 又 遇 着 叔叔 欠安 。 — — 叔叔 如今 可 大安 了 ？ ”,"Jia Yun returned his smile : ' Let's just say that it was not my luck to see you then . But you have been ill since then , Uncle Bao . Are you quite better now ? '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 大好 了 。 我 倒 听见 说 你 辛苦 了 好 几天 。 ”,"' Quite better , thank you . I hear you have been very busy these last few days . '"
贾芸道 ： “ 辛苦 也 是 该当 的 。 叔叔 大安 了 ， 也 是 我们 一家子 的 造化 。 ”,"' That is as it should be , ' said Jia Yun . But I am glad you are better , Uncle . That is a piece of good fortune for all of us . '"
说 着 ， 只见 有个 丫鬟 端 了 茶 来 与 他 ， 那 贾芸 嘴里 和 宝玉 说话 ， 眼睛 却 瞅 那 丫鬟 ： 细挑 身子 ， 容长 脸儿 ， 穿着 银红 袄 儿 ， 青 缎子 坎肩 ， 白 绫细 折儿 裙子 。,"As they chatted , a maid came in with some tea . Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she approached , but his eyes were on her . She was tall and rather thin with a long oval face , and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress ."
那 贾芸 自从 宝玉 病 了 ， 他 在 里头 混 了 两天 ， 都 把 有名 人口 记 了 一半 ；,"In the course of his brief sojourn among them in the early days of Bao-yu 's illness , Jia Yun had got by heart the names of most of the principal females of Bao-yu 's establishment ."
他 看见 这 丫环 ， 知道 是 袭 人 ， 他 在 宝玉 房中 ， 比 别人 不同 ， 如今 端 了 茶 来 ， 宝玉 又 在 旁边 坐 着 ， 便 忙 站 起来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 姐姐 怎么 给 我 倒 起 茶 来 ？,"He knew at a glance that the maid now serving him tea was Aroma . He was also aware that she was in some way more important than the other maids and that to be waited on by her in the seated presence of her master was an honour . Jumping hastily to his feet he addressed her with a modest smile : ' You should not pour tea for me , Miss !"
我 来到 叔叔 这里 ， 又 不是 客 ， 等 我 自己 倒 罢了 。 ”,I am not like a visitor here . You should let me pour for myself ! '
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 只管 坐 着 罢 。,' Oh do sit down ! ' said Bao-yu .
丫头 们 跟前 也 是 这么着 。 ”,You do not have to be like that in front of the maids ! '
贾芸笑 道 ： “ 虽 那么 说 ， 叔叔 屋里 的 姐姐 们 ， 我 怎么 敢 放肆 呢 。 ”,"' I know , ' said Jia Yun . ' But a body-servant ! I do not like to presume . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 坐下 吃 茶 。 那宝玉 便 和 他 说 些 没 要紧 的 散话 ： 又 说道 谁家 的 戏子 好 ， 谁家 的 花园 好 ， 又 告诉 他 谁家 的 丫头 标致 ， 谁家 的 酒席 丰盛 ， 又 是 谁家 有奇 货 ， 又 是 谁家 有 异物 。,"He sat down , nevertheless , and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a number of unimportant topics . He told him which household kept the best troupe of players , which had the finest gardens , whose maids were the prettiest , who gave the best parties , and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets ."
那 贾芸 口里 只得 顺着 他 说 。,Jia Yun did his best to keep up with him .
说 了 一回 ， 见 宝玉 有些 懒懒 的 了 ， 便 起身 告辞 。,"After a while Bao-yu showed signs of flagging , and when Jia Yun , observing what appeared to be fatigue , rose to take his leave , he did not very strongly press him to stay"
宝玉 也 不 甚 留 ， 只 说 ： “ 你 明儿 闲 了 只管 来 。 ” 仍命 小丫头 子 坠儿 送出去 了 。,"' You must come again when you can spare the time , ' said Bao-yu , and ordered Trinket to see him out of the Garden ."
贾芸 出 了 怡红院 ， 见 四顾无人 ， 便 慢慢 的 停 着 些 走 ， 口里 一长一短 和 坠儿 说话 。,"Once outside the gateway of Green Delights , Jia Yun looked around him on all sides , and having ascertained that there was no one else about , slowed down to a more dawdling pace so that he could ask Trinket a few questions ."
先 问 他 ： “ 几岁 了 ？,"Indeed , the little maid was subjected to quite a catechism : How old was she ?"
名字 叫 什么 ？,What was her name ?
你 父母 在 那行 上 ？,What did her father and mother do ?
在 宝叔 屋里 几年 了 ？,How many years had she been working for his Uncle Bao ?
一个月 多少钱 ？,How much pay did she get a month ?
共总 宝叔 屋内 有 几个 女孩子 ？ ”,How many girls were there working for him altogether ?
那 坠儿 见 问 ， 便 一桩 桩 的 都 告诉 他 了 。,"Trinket seemed to have no objection , however , and answered each question as it came ."
贾芸 又 道 ： “ 刚才 那个 和 你 说话 的 ， 他 可是 叫 小 红 ？ ”,"' That girl you were talking to on the way in , ' he said , ' is not her name "" Crimson "" ? '"
坠儿 笑 道 ： “ 他 就 叫 小 红 。 你 问 他 作 什么 ？ ”,Trinket laughed : ' Yes . Why do you ask ? '
贾芸道 ： “ 方才 他 问 你 什么 绢子 ， 我 倒 拣 了 一块 。 ”,' I heard her asking you about a handkerchief . Only it just so happens that I picked one up . '
坠儿 听 了 笑 道 ： “ 他 问 了 我 好几遍 ： 可 有 看见 他 的 绢子 的 。,Trinket showed interest . ' She is asked me about that handkerchief of hers a number of times .
我 那里 那么 大 工夫 管 这些 事 ？,"I told her , I have got better things to do with my time than go looking for people 's handkerchiefs ."
今儿 他 又 问 我 。 他 说 ， 我 替 他 找 着 了 他 还 谢 我 呢 。,"But when she asked me about it again today , she said that if I could find it for her , she would give me a reward ."
才 在 蘅 芜院 门口 儿说 的 ， 二爷 也 听见 了 ， 不是 我 撒谎 。,"Come to think of it , you were there when she said that , were not you ? It was when we were outside the gate of Allspice Court . So you can bear me out ."
好 二爷 ， 你 既 拣 了 ， 给 我 罢 ； 我 看 他 拿 什么 谢 我 ！ ”,"Oh Mr Jia , please let me have it if you have picked it up and I will be able to see what she will give me for it ! '"
原来 上月 贾芸 进来 种树 之 时 ， 便 拣 了 一块 罗帕 ， 知是 这 园内 的 人 失落 的 ， 但 不知 是 那 一个 人 的 ， 故 不敢造次 。,"Jia Yun had picked up a silk handkerchief a month previously at the time when his tree-planting activities had just started . He knew that it must have been dropped by one or another of the female inmates of the Garden , but not knowing which , had not so far ventured to do anything about his discovery ."
今 听见 小 红 问 坠儿 ， 知 是 他 的 ， 心 内 不胜 喜幸 。,"When earlier on he had heard Crimson question Trinket about her loss , he had realized , with a thrill of pleasure , that the handkerchief he had picked up must have been hers ."
又 见 坠儿 追索 ， 心中 早 得 了 主意 ， 便 向 袖 内 将 自己 的 一块 取出 来 ， 向 坠儿 笑 道 ： “ 我 给 是 给 你 ， 你 要 得 了 他 的 谢礼 ， 可 不许 瞒 着 我 。 ”,"Trinket 's request now gave him just the opening he required . He drew a handkerchief of his own from inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile : ' I will give it to you on one condition . If she let's you have this reward you were speaking of ; you have got to let me know . No cheating , mind ! '"
坠儿 满口 里 答应 了 ， 接 了 绢子 ， 送出 贾芸 ， 回来 找 小 红 ， 不在话下 。,"Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed of the outcome , and having seen him out of the Garden , went back again to look for Crimson ."
如今 且说 宝玉 打发 贾芸 去 后 ， 意思 懒懒 的 ， 歪 在 床上 ， 似 有 朦胧 之 态 。,"Our narrative returns now to Bao-yu . After disposing of Jia Yun , Bao-yu continued to feel extremely lethargic and lay back on the bed with every appearance of being about to doze off to sleep ."
袭 人 便 走上 来 ， 坐在 床沿 上推 他 ， 说道 ： “ 怎么 又 要 睡觉 ？ 你 闷 的 很 ， 出去 逛逛 不好 ？ ”,"Aroma hurried over to him and , sitting on the edge of the bed , roused him with a shake : ' Come on ! Surely you are not going to sleep again ? You need some fresh air . Why do not you go outside and walk around for a bit ? '"
宝玉 见 说 ， 携 着 他 的 手 笑 道 ： “ 我 要 去 ， 只是 舍不得你 。 ”,"Bao-yu took her by the hand and smiled at her . ' I would like to go , ' he said , but I do not want to leave you . '"
袭 人 笑 道 ： “ 你 别 没 的 说 了 ！ ”,' Silly ! ' said Aroma with a laugh . ' Do not say what you do not mean ! '
一面 说 ， 一面 拉起 他 来 。,She hoicked him to his feet .
宝玉 道 ： “ 可 往 那里 去 呢 ？ 怪腻 腻烦 烦 的 。 ”,"' Well , where am I going to go then ? ' said Bao-yu . ' I just feel so bored . '"
袭 人 道 ： “ 你 出去 了 就 好 了 ， 只管 这么 〈 葳蕤 〉 ， 越发 心里 腻烦 了 。 ”,"' Never mind where , just go out ! ' said Aroma . ' If you stay moping indoors like this , you will get even more bored . '"
宝玉 无精打彩 ， 只得 依 他 。 就 出 了 房门 ， 在 回廊 上 调弄 了 一回 雀儿 ， 出至 院外 ， 顺着 沁 芳 溪 ， 看 了 一回 金鱼 。,"Bao-yu followed her advice , albeit half-heartedly , and went out into the courtyard . After visiting the cages in the gallery and playing for a bit with the birds , he ambled out of the courtyard into the Garden and along the bank of Drenched Blossoms Stream , pausing for a while to look at the goldfish in the water ."
只见 那边 山坡 上 两只 小鹿儿 箭 也 似的 跑 来 。,"As he did so , a pair of fawns came running like the wind from the hillside opposite ."
宝玉 不解 何意 ， 正自 纳闷 ， 只见 贾兰 在 后面 ， 拿 着 一张 小弓儿 赶来 。,"Bao-yu was puzzled . There seemed to be no reason for their mysterious terror . But just then little Jia Lan came running down the same slope after them , a tiny bow clutched in his hand ."
一 见 宝玉 在 前 ， 便 站住 了 ， 笑 道 ： “ 二叔叔 在 家里 呢 ， — — 我 只当 出门 去 了 呢 。 ”,"Seeing his uncle ahead of him , he stood politely to attention and greeted him cheerfully : ' Hello , Uncle . I did not know you were at home . I thought you would gone out . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 又 淘气 了 。 好好儿 的 ， 射 他 做 什么 ？ ”,"' Mischievous little blighter , are not you ? ' said Bao-yu . ' What do you want to go shooting them for , poor little things ? '"
贾兰笑 道 ： “ 这 会子 不 念书 ， 闲着 做 什么 ？ 所以 演习 演习 骑射 。 ”,"' I have got no reading to do today , ' said Jia Lan , ' and I do not like to hang about doing nothing , so I thought I would practise my archery and equitation . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 磕 了 牙 ， 那 时候 儿 才 不演 呢 。 ”,"' Goodness ! You would better not waste time jawing , then , ' said Bao-yu , and left the young toxophilite to his pursuits ."
说 着 ， 便 顺脚 一 径来至 一个 院门 前 ， 看 那 凤尾 森森 ， 龙吟 细细 ： 正是 潇湘 馆 。,"Moving on , without much thinking where he was going , he came presently to the gate of a courtyard . Denser than feathers on the phoenix ' tail The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragon 's moan . The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet had , without conscious direction , carried him to the Naiad 's House ."
宝玉 信步 走入 ， 只见 湘帘 垂地 ， 悄 无人 声 。 走 至 窗前 ， 觉得 一缕 幽香 ， 从碧 纱窗 中 暗暗 透出 。,"Of their own accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard . The House seemed silent and deserted , its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to the ground ; but as he approached the window , he detected a faint sweetness in the air , traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green gauze of the casement ."
宝玉 便 将 脸 贴 在 纱窗 上 看 时 ， 耳内 忽 听 得 细细的 长叹 了 一声 ， 道 ： “ ‘ 每日 家 ， 情思 睡 昏昏 ！ ’ ”,"He pressed his face to the gauze ; but before his eyes could distinguish anything , his ear became aware of a long , languorous sigh and the sound of a voice speaking : ' Euch day in a drowsy wahing dream of love . '"
宝玉 听 了 ， 不觉 心内 痒 将 起来 。,Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker .
再 看 时 ， 只见 黛玉 在 床上 伸懒腰 。,"He could see her now . It was Dai-yu , of course , lying on her bed , stretching herself and yawning luxuriously ."
宝玉 在 窗外 笑 道 ： “ 为什么 ‘ 每日 家 情思 睡 昏昏 ’ 的 ？ ” 一面 说 ， 一面 掀帘子 进来 了 。,"He laughed : ' Why "" each day in a drowsy waking dream of love "" ? ' he asked through the window ( the words were from his beloved Western Chamber ) ; then going to the doorway he lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room ."
黛玉 自觉 忘情 ， 不觉 红了脸 ， 拿 袖子 遮 了 脸 ， 翻身 向 里 装 睡着 了 。,"Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard . She covered her burning face with her sleeve , and turning over towards the wall , pretended to be asleep ."
宝玉 才 走上 来 ， 要 扳 他 的 身子 ， 只见 黛玉 的 奶娘 并 两个 婆子 却 跟 进来 了 ， 说 ： “ 妹妹 睡觉 呢 ， 等 醒来 再 请 罢 。 ”,"Bao-yu went over intending to turn her back again , but just at that moment Dai-yu 's old wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels : ' Miss Lin 's asleep , sir . Would you mind coming back again after she is woken up ? '"
刚 说 着 ， 黛玉 便 翻身 坐 起来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 谁 睡觉 呢 ？ ”,Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh : ' Who is asleep ? '
那 两三个 婆子 见 黛玉 起来 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 我们 只当 姑娘 睡着 了 。 ”,"The three old women laughed apologetically . ' Sorry , miss . We thought you were asleep ."
说 着 ， 便 叫 紫鹃 ， 说 ： “ 姑娘 醒 了 ， 进来 伺候 。 ”,Nightingale ! Come inside now ! Your mistress is awake . '
一面 说 ， 一面 都 去 了 。,"Having shouted for Nightingale , the three guardians of morality retired ."
黛玉 坐在 床上 ， 一面 抬手 整理 鬓发 ， 一面 笑 问宝玉 道 ： “ 人家 睡觉 ， 你 进来 做 什么 ？ ”,"' What do you mean by coming into people 's rooms when they are asleep ? ' said Dai-yu , smiling up at Bao-yu as she sat on the bed 's edge patting her hair into shape ."
宝玉 见 他 星眼微 饧 ， 香腮 带 赤 ， 不觉 神魂 早荡 ， 一 歪身 坐在 椅子 上 ， 笑 道 ： “ 你 才 说 什么 ？ ”,At the sight of those soft cheeks so adorably flushed and the starry eyes a little misted with sleep a wave of emotion passed over him . He sank into a chair and smiled back at her : ' What was that you were saying just now before I came in ? '
黛玉 道 ： “ 我 没 说 什么 。 ”,"' I did not say anything , ' said Dai-yu ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 给你个 榧子 吃 呢 ！ 我 都 听见 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu laughed and snapped his fingers at her : ' Put that on your tongue , girl ! I heard you say it . '"
二人 正 说话 ， 只见 紫鹃 进来 ， 宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 紫鹃 ， 把 你们 的 好 茶 沏 碗 我 喝 。 ”,"While they were talking to one another , Nightingale came in . ' Nightingale , ' said Bao-yu , ' what about a cup of that excellent tea of yours ? '"
紫鹃 道 ： “ 我们 那里 有好 的 ？,' Excellent tea ? ' said Nightingale . ' There is nothing very special about the tea we drink here .
要 好 的 只好 等 袭 人 来 。 ”,"If nothing but the best will do , you would better wait for Aroma to come . '"
黛玉 道 ： “ 别理 他 。 你 先 给 我 舀水 去 罢 。 ”,' Never mind about him ! ' said Dai-yu . ' First go and get me some water ! '
紫鹃 道 ： “ 他 是 客 ， 自然 先 沏 了 茶 来 再 舀水 去 。 ”,"' He is our guest , ' said Nightingale . ' I can not fetch you any water until I have given him his tea . '"
说 着 ， 倒 茶 去 了 。,And she went to pour him a cup .
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 好 丫头 ！ ‘ 若 共 你 多情 小姐 同 鸳帐 ， 怎 舍得 叫 你 叠被 铺床 ？ ”,"' Good girl ! ' said Bao-yu . ' If with your amorous mistress I should wed , ' Tis you , sweet maid , must make our bridal bed . '"
,"The words , like Dai-yu 's languorous line , were from Western Chamber , but in somewhat dubious taste ."
黛玉 登时 急 了 ， 撂下 脸 来 说道 ： “ 你 说 什么 ？ ”,Dai-yu was dreadfully offended by them . In an instant the smile had vanished from her face . ' What was that you said ? '
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 我 何尝 说 什么 ？ ”,"He laughed , ' I did not say anything . '"
黛玉 便 哭 道 ： “ 如今 新兴 的 ， 外头 听 了 村 话 来 ， 也 说 给 我 听 ； 看 了 混账 书 ， 也 拿 我 取笑 儿 。 我 成 了 替 爷们 解闷 儿 的 了 。 ”,"Dai-yu began to cry . ' This is your latest amusement , I suppose . Every time you hear some coarse expression outside or read some crude , disgusting book , you have to come back here and give me the benefit of it . I am to become a source of entertainment for the menfolk now , it seems . '"
一面 哭 ， 一面 下床 来 ， 往 外 就 走 。,"She rose , weeping , from the bed and went outside ."
宝玉 心下 慌 了 ， 忙 赶上 来说 ： “ 好 妹妹 ， 我 一时 该死 ， 你 好歹 别 告诉 去 ！ 我 再敢 说 这些 话 ， 嘴上 就 长 个疔 ， 烂 了 舌头 。 ”,"Bao-yu followed her in alarm . ' Dearest coz , it was very wrong of me to say that , but it just slipped out without thinking . Please do not go and tell ! I promise never to say anything like that again . May my mouth rot and my tongue decay if I do ! '"
正说 着 ， 只见 袭 人 走来 ， 说道 ： “ 快回去 穿 衣裳 去 罢 ， 老爷 叫 你 呢 。 ”,Just at that moment Aroma came hurrying up : ' Quick ! ' she said . ' You must come back and change . The Master wants to see you . '
宝玉 听 了 ， 不觉 打了个 焦雷 一般 ， 也 顾不得 别的 ， 疾忙 回来 穿衣服 。 出园 来 ， 只见 焙 茗 在 二 门前 等 着 。,"The descent of this thunderbolt drove all else from his mind and he rushed off in a panic . As soon as he had changed , he hurried out of the Garden . Tealeaf was waiting for him outside the inner gate ."
宝玉 问道 ： “ 你 可 知道 老爷 叫 我 是 为什么 ？ ”,' I suppose you do not know what he wants to see me about ? ' Bao-yu asked him .
焙 茗 道 ： “ 爷 快 出来 罢 ， 横竖 是 见 去 的 ， 到 那里 就 知道 了 。 ”,"' I should hurry up , if I were you , ' said Tealeaf . ' All I know is that he wants to see you . You will find out why soon enough when you get there . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 催 着 宝玉 。,He hustled him along as he spoke .
转过 大厅 ， 宝玉 心里 还 自 狐疑 ， 只 听 墙角 边 一阵 呵呵大笑 ， 回头见 薛蟠 拍 着手 跳 出来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 要 不 说 姨夫 叫 你 ， 你 那里 肯出来 的 这么 快 ！ ”,"They had passed round the main hall , Bao-yu still in a state of fluttering apprehensiveness when there was a loud guffaw from a corner of the wall . It was Xue Pan , clapping his hands and stamping his feet in mirth . ' Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! You would never have come this quickly if you had not been told that Uncle wanted you ! '"
焙 茗 也 笑 着 跪下 了 。,"Tealeaf , also laughing , fell on his knees ."
宝玉 怔 了 半天 ， 方想 过来 — — 是 薛蟠 哄出 他 来 。,Bao-yu stood there looking puzzled . It was some moments before it dawned on him that he had been hoaxed .
薛蟠 连忙 打恭作揖 赔不是 ，,Xue Pan was by this time being apologetic - bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how sorry he was :
又 求 ： “ 别 难 为了 小子 ， 都 是 我 央及 他 去 的 。 ”,' Do not blame the lad ! ' he said . ' It was not his fault . I talked him into it . '
宝玉 也 无法 了 ， 只好 笑 问道 ： “ 你 哄 我 也罢 了 ， 怎么 说 是 老爷 呢 ？,"Bao-yu saw that he could do nothing , and might as well accept with a good grace . ' I do not mind being made a fool of , ' he said , ' but I think it was going a bit far to bring my father into it ."
我 告诉 姨娘 去 ， 评评 这个 理 ， 可 使得 么 ？ ”,I think perhaps I would better tell Aunt Xue and see what she thinks about it all . '
薛蟠忙 道 ： “ 好 兄弟 ， 我 原为 求 你 快些 出来 ， 就 忘 了 忌讳 这 句 话 ， 改日 你 要 哄 我 ， 也 说 我 父亲 ， 就 完 了 。 ”,"' Now look here , old chap , ' said Xue Pan , getting agitated , ' it was only because I wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker . I admit it was very wrong of me to make free with your Parent , but after all , you have only got to mention my father next time you want to fool me and we will be quits ! '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 暧哟 ！ 越发 的 该死 了 。 ”,' Aiyo ! ' said Bao-yu . ' Worse and worse ! '
又 向 焙 茗 道 ： “ 反叛 杂种 ， 还 跪 着 做 什么 ？ ”,He turned to Tealeaf . ' Treacherous little beast ! What are you still kneeling for ? '
焙 茗 连忙 叩头 起来 。,Tealeaf kotowed and rose to his feet .
薛蟠 道 ： “ 要不是 ， 我 也 不敢 惊动 ： 只 因 ｛ 下 月 ｝ 初三 日 ， 是 我 的 生日 ， 谁知 老胡 和 老程 他们 ， 不知 那里 寻 了 来 的 ， 这么 粗 ， 这么 长 ， 粉 脆 的 鲜藕 ； 这么 大 的 西瓜 ； 这么 长 ， 这么 大 的 暹罗 国 进贡 的 灵柏 香熏 的 暹罗 猪 、 鱼 。,"' Look , ' said Xue Pan . ' I would not have troubled you otherwise , only it is my birthday on the third of next month and old Hu and old Cheng and a couple of the others , I do not know where they got them from but they have given me : a piece of fresh lotus root , ever so crisp and crunchy , as thick as that , look , and as long as that ; a huge great melon , look , as big as that ; a freshly-caught sturgeon as big as that ; and a cypress-smoked Siamese sucking-pig as big as that that came in the tribute from Siam ."
你 说 这 四样 礼物 ， 可 难得 不 难得 ？,Do not you think it was clever of them to get me those things ?
— — 那 鱼 、 猪 不过 贵 而 难得 ， 这 藕 和 瓜亏 他 怎么 种 出来 的 ！,Maybe not so much the sturgeon and the sucking-pig . They are just expensive . But where would you go to get a piece of lotus root or a melon like that ? However did they get them to grow so big ?
我 先 孝敬 了 母亲 ， 赶着 就 给 你们 老太太 、 姨母 送 了 些 去 。 如今 留 了 些 ， 我 要 自己 吃 ， 恐怕 折福 ， 左思右想 ， 除我之外 ， 惟 你 还 配 吃 ， 所以 特 请 你 来 。,"I have given some of the stuff to Mother , and while I was about it I sent some round to your grandmother and Auntie Wang , but I have still got a lot left over . I can not eat it all myself : it would be unlucky . But apart from me , the only person I can think of who is worthy to eat a present like this is you . That is why I came over specially to invite you ."
可巧 唱曲 儿 的 一个 小子 又 来 了 ， 我 和 你 乐 一天 何如 ？ ”,"And we are lucky , because we have got a little chap who sings coming round as well . So you and I will be able to sit down and make a day of it , eh ? Really enjoy ourselves . '"
一面 说 ， 一面 来到 他 书房 里 ， 只见 詹光 、 程日兴 、 胡斯 来 、 单聘仁 等 并 唱曲 儿 的 小子 都 在 这里 。,"Xue Pan , still talking , conducted Bao-yu to his ' study ' , where Zhan Guang , Cheng Ri-xing , Hu Si-lai and Shan Pin-ren ( the four donors of the feast ) and the young singer he had mentioned were already waiting ."
见 他 进来 ， 请安 的 ， 问好 的 ， 都 彼此 见 过 了 。 吃 了 茶 ， 薛蟠 即 命 人 ： “ 摆酒 来 。 ”,"They rose to welcome Bao-yu as he entered . When the bowings and courtesies were over and tea had been taken , Xue Pan called for his servants to lay ."
说犹 未了 ， 众 小厮 七手八脚 — — 摆 了 半天 ， 方才 停当 归 坐 。,"A tremendous bustle ensued , which seemed to go on for quite a long time before everything was finally ready and the diners were able to take their places at the table ."
宝玉 果 见 瓜 藕 新异 ， 因 笑 道 ： “ 我 的 寿礼 还 没 送来 ， 倒 先 扰 了 。 ”,"Bao-yu noticed sliced melon and lotus root among the dishes , both of unusual quality and size . ' It seems wrong to be sharing your presents with you before I have given you anything myself , ' he said jokingly ."
薛蟠 道 ： “ 可是 呢 ， 你 明儿 来 拜寿 ， 打算 送 什么 新鲜 物儿 ？ ”,"' Yes , ' said Xue Pan . ' What are you planning to give me for my birthday next month ? Something new and out of the ordinary , I hope . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 没有 什么 送 的 。,"' I haven ' t really got anything much to give you , ' said Bao-yu ."
若论 银钱 吃 穿 等 类 的 东西 ， 究竟 还 不是 我 的 ， 惟有 写 一张 字 ， 或 画 一张 画 ， 这 才 是 我 的 。 ”,"' Things like money and food and clothing I do not want for , but they are not really mine to give . The only way I could give you something that would really be mine would be by doing some calligraphy or painting a picture for you . '"
薛蟠笑 道 ： “ 你 提 画儿 ， 我 才 想 起来 了 ： 昨儿 我 看见 人家 一本 春宫 儿 ， 画 的 很好 ， 上头 还有 许多 的 字 。 我 也 没 细看 ， 只 看落 的 款 ， 原来 是 什么 ‘ 庚 黄 ’ 的 。 真好 的 了不得 ！ ”,"' Talking of pictures , ' said Xue Pan genially , ' that is reminded me . I saw a set of dirty pictures in someone 's house the other day . They were real beauties . There was a lot of writing on top that I did not pay much attention to , but I did notice the signature . I think it was "" Geng Huang "" , the man who painted them . They were really good ! '"
宝玉 听说 ， 心下 猜疑 道 ： “ 古今 字画 也 都 见 过 些 ， 那里 有个 ‘ 庚 黄 ’ ？ … … ”,"Bao-yu was puzzled . His knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both past and present was not inconsiderable , but he had never in all his experience come across a ' Geng Huang ' ."
想 了 半天 ， 不觉 笑 将 起来 ， 命人 取过 笔 来 ， 在手 心里 写 了 两个 字 ， 又 问 薛蟠 道 ： “ 你 看真 了 是 ‘ 庚 黄 ‘ 么 ？ ”,"After racking his brains for some moments he suddenly began to chuckle and called for a writing-brush . A writing-brush having been produced by one of the servants , he wrote two characters with it in the palm of his hand . ' Are you quite sure the signature you saw was "" Geng Huang "" ? ' he asked Xue Pan ."
薛蟠 道 ： “ 怎么 没看 真 ？ ”,' What do you mean ? ' said Xue Pan . ' Of course I am sure . '
宝玉 将手 一 撒 给 他 看道 ： “ 可是 这 两个 字 罢 ？ — — 其实 和 ‘ 庚 黄 ’ 相去不远 。 ”,Bao-yu opened his hand and held it up for Xue Pan to see : ' You sure it was not these two characters ? They are quite similar . '
众人 都 看 时 ， 原来 是 “ 唐寅 ” 两个 字 ， 都 笑 道 ： “ 想必 是 这 两个 字 ， 大爷 一时 眼花 了 ， 也 未可知 。 ”,"The others crowded round to look . They all laughed when they saw what he had written : ' Yes , it must have been "" Tang Yin "" . Mr Xue could not have been seeing straight that day . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! '"
薛蟠自 觉 没趣 ， 笑 道 ： “ 谁知 他 是 ‘ 糖 银 ‘ 是 ‘ 果 银 ’ 的 ！ ”,"Xue Pan realized that he had made a fool of himself , but passed it off with an embarrassed laugh : ' Oh , Tankin ' or wankin ' , he said , ' what difference does it make , anyway ? '"
正说 着 ， 小厮 来回 ： “ 冯大爷 来 了 。 ” 宝玉 便 知 是 神武 将军 冯唐 之 子 冯紫英 来 了 。,"Just then ' Mr Feng ' was announced by one of the servants , which Bao-yu knew could only mean General Feng Tang 's son , Feng Zi-ying ."
薛蟠 等 一齐 都 叫 “ 快 请 ” 。 说犹 未了 ， 只见 冯紫英 一路 说 笑 ， 已 进来 了 ， 众人 忙 起席 让 坐 。,"Xue Pan and the rest told the boy to bring him in immediately , but Feng Zi-ying was already striding in , talking and laughing as he went . The others hurriedly rose and invited him to take a seat ."
冯紫英 笑 道 ： “ 好 啊 ！ 也 不 出门 了 ， 在 家里 高乐 罢 。 ”,"' Ha ! ' said Feng Zi-ying . ' No need to go out then . Enjoyin ' yourselves at home , eh ? Very nice too ! '"
宝玉 薛蟠 都 笑 道 ： “ 一向 少会 。 老世伯 身上 安好 ？ ”,"' It is a long time since we have seen you around , ' said Bao-yu . ' How is the General ? '"
紫英 答道 ： “ 家父 倒 也 托庇 康健 。 但 近来 家母 偶着 了 些 风寒 ， 不好 了 两天 。 ”,"' Fahver 's in good health , thank you very much , ' said Feng Zi-ying , ' but Muvver hasn ' t been too well lately . Caught a chill or something . '"
薛蟠见 他 面上 有些 青伤 ， 便 笑 道 ： “ 这 脸上 ， 又 和 谁 挥拳 来 ， 挂 了 幌子 了 ！ ”,"Observing with glee that Feng Zi-ying was sporting a black eye , Xue Pan asked him how he had come by it : ' Been having a dust-up , then ? Who was it this time ? Looks as if he left his signature ! '"
冯紫英 笑 道 ： “ 从 那 一遭 把 仇 都尉 的 儿子 打伤 了 ， 我 记 了 ， 再 不 怄气 ， 如何 又 挥拳 ？,Feng Zi-ying laughed : ' Do not use the mitts any more nowadays - not since that time I laid into Colonel Qiu 's son and did him an injury . That was a lesson to me . I have learned to keep my temper since then .
这 脸上 是 前日 打围 ， 在 铁网 山 叫 兔 鹘 梢 了 一 翅膀 。 ”,"No , this happened the other day durin ' a huntin ' expedition in the Iron Net Mountains . I got flicked by a goshawk 's wing . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 几时 的话 ？ ”,' When was this ? ' Bao-yu asked him .
紫英 道 ： “ ｛ 上 ｝ 月 二十八日 去 的 ， 前儿 也 就 回来 了 。 ”,"' We left on the twenty-eighth of last month , ' said Feng Zi-ying . ' Did not get back till a few days ago . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 怪 道 前儿 ［ 初三 四儿 ］ 我 在 沈 世兄 家 赴席 不见 你 呢 ！,"' Ah , that explains why I did not see you at Shen 's party earlier this month , ' said Bao-yu ."
我 要 问 ， 不知 怎么 忘 了 。,"' I meant at the time to ask why you were not there , but I forgot ."
— — 单 你 去 了 ， 还是 老世伯 也 去 了 ？ ”,Did you go alone on this expedition or was the General there with you ? '
紫英 道 ： “ 可不是 家父 去 ！,"' Fahver most certainly was there , ' said Feng Zi-ying ."
我 没法儿 ， 去 罢了 。,' I was practically dragged along in tow .
难道 我 闲 疯 了 ？ 咱们 几个 人 吃酒 听唱 的 不乐 ， 寻 那个 苦恼 去 ？,Do you think I am mad enough to go rushin ' off in pursuit of hideous hardships when I could be sittin ' comfortably at home eatin ' good food and drinkin ' good wine and listenin ' to the odd song or two ?
— — 这 一次 大 不幸 之中 却 有 大幸 。 ”,"Still , some good came of it . It was a lucky accident . '"
薛蟠 众人 见 他 吃 完 了 茶 ， 都 说道 ： “ 且 入席 ， 有话 慢慢 的 说 。 ” 冯紫英 听说 ， 便立 起身 来 说道 ： “ 论理 ， 我 该 陪 饮 几杯 才 是 ， 只是 今儿 有 一件 很 要紧 的 事 ， 回去 还要 见 家父 面回 ， 实 不敢 领 。 ”,"As he had now finished his tea , Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them his story at leisure , but Feng Zi-ying rose to his feet again and declined . ' I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you , ' he said , but there is something very important I have got to see Fahver about now , so I am afraid I really must refuse . '"
薛蟠 宝玉 众人 那里 肯依 ， 死 拉 着 不放 。,"But Xue Pan , Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table ."
冯紫英 笑 道 ： “ 这 又 奇 了 。 你 我 这些 年 ， 那 一回 有 这个 道理 的 ？ 实在 不能 遵命 。,"' Now look here , this is too bad ! ' Feng Zi-ying good-humouredly protested . ' All the years we have been knockin ' around togevver we have never before insisted that a fellow should have to stay if he do not want to . The fact is , I really can not ."
若 必定 叫 我 喝 ， 拿 大杯 来 ， 我 领 两杯 就是 了 。 ”,"Oh well , if I must have a drink , fetch some decent-sized cups and I will just put down a couple of quick ones ! '"
众人 听说 ， 只得 罢了 ， 薛蟠 执壶 ， 宝玉 把盏 ， 斟 了 两 大海 。,"This was clearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced . Two sconce-cups were brought and ceremoniously filled , Bao-yu holding the cups and Xue Pan pouring from the wine-kettle ."
那 冯紫英 站 着 ， 一气 而 尽 。,"Feng Zi-ying drank them standing , one after the other , each in a single breath ."
宝玉 道 ： “ 你 到底 把 这个 ‘ 不幸 之 幸 ’ 说完 了 再 走 。 ”,"' Now come on , ' said Bao-yu , ' let's hear about this "" Iucky accident "" before you go ! '"
冯紫英 笑 道 ： “ 今儿 说 的 也 不 尽兴 ， 我 为 这个 ， 还要 特治 一个 东儿 ， 请 你们 去 细 谈一谈 ， 二则 还有 奉 恳之处 。 ”,"Feng Zi-ying laughed : ' Could not tell it properly just now , ' he said . ' It is something that needs a special party all to itself . I will invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the details then . There is a favour I want to ask too , by the bye , so we will be able to talk about that then as well . '"
说 着 撒手 就 走 。,He made a determined movement towards the door .
薛蟠 道 ： “ 越发 说 的 人 热 剌 剌 的 扔 不下 ， 多早晚 才 请 我们 ？,' Now you have got us all peeing ourselves with curiosity ! ' said Xue Pan .
告诉 了 也 省 了 人 打 闷雷 。 ”,"' You might at least tell us when this party is going to be , to put us out of our suspense . '"
冯紫英 道 ： “ 多则 十日 ， 少 则 八天 。 ” 一面 说 一面 出门 上马 去 了 。,"' Not more than ten days ' time and not less than eight , ' said Feng Zi-ying ; and going out into the courtyard , he jumped on his horse and clattered away ."
众人 回来 ， 依席 又 饮 了 一回 方散 。,"Having seen him off , the others went in again , reseated themselves at table , and resumed their potations ."
宝玉 回至 园中 ， 袭 人 正 惦记 他 去 见 贾政 ， 不知 是 祸 是 福 ， 只见 宝玉 醉醺醺 回来 ， 因 问 其 原故 ， 宝玉 一 一向 他 说 了 ， 袭 人 道 ： “ 人家 牵肠挂肚 的 等 着 ， 你 且 高乐 去 ！ 也 到底 打发 个人 来 给 个 信儿 ！ ”,"When the party finally broke up , Bao-yu returned to the Garden in a state of cheerful inebriation . Aroma , who had had no idea what the summons from Jia Zheng might portend and was still wondering anxiously what had become of him , at once demanded to know the cause of his condition . He gave her a full account of what had happened ' Well really ! ' said Aroma . ' Here were we practically beside ourselves with anxiety , and all the time you were there enjoying yourself ! You might at least have sent word to let us know you were all right . '"
宝玉 道 ： “ 我 何尝 不要 送信儿 ， 因 冯 世兄 来 了 ， 就 混 忘 了 。 ”,"' I was going to send word , ' said Bao-yu . ' Of course I was . But then old Feng arrived and it put it out of my mind . '"
正说 着 ， 只见 宝钗 走进 来 ， 笑 道 ： “ 偏 了 我们 新鲜 东西 了 ！ ”,"At that moment Bao-chai walked in , all smiles . ' I hear you have made a start on the famous present , ' she said ."
宝玉 笑 道 ： “ 姐姐 家 的 东西 ， 自然 先 偏 了 我们 了 。 ”,' But surely you and your family must have had some already ? ' said Bao-yu .
宝钗 摇头 笑 道 ： “ 昨儿 哥哥 倒 特特 的 请 我 吃 ， 我 不吃 ， 我 叫 他 留 着 送给 别人 罢 。 我 知道 我 的 命 小福薄 ， 不配 吃 那个 。 ”,"Bao-chai shook her head : ' Pan was very pressing that I should have some , but I refused . I told him to save it for other people . I know I am not really the right sort of person for such superior delicacies . If I were to eat any , I should be afraid of some frightful nemesis overtaking me . '"
说 着 ， 丫鬟 倒 了 茶 来 ， 吃 茶 说闲话 儿 ， 不在话下 。,"A maid poured tea for her as she spoke , and conversation of a desultory kind proceeded between sips ."
却说 那黛玉 听见 贾政叫 了 宝玉 去 了 一日 不 回来 ， 心中 也 替 他 忧虑 。,"Our narrative returns now to Dai-yu . Having been present when Bao-yu received his summons , Dai-yu , too , was greatly worried about him - the more so as the day advanced and he had still not returned ."
至 晚饭 后 ， 闻得宝玉 来 了 ， 心里 要 找 他 问问 是 怎么样 了 ， 一步步 行来 ， 见 宝钗进 宝玉 的 园内 去 了 ， 自己 也 随后 走 了 来 。,"Then in the evening , some time after dinner , she heard that he had just got back and resolved to go over and ask him exactly what had happened . She was sauntering along on the way there when she caught sight of Bao-chai some distance ahead of her , just entering Bao-yu 's courtyard ."
刚 到 了 沁 芳 桥 ， 只见 各色 水禽 尽都 在 池中 浴水 ， 也 认不出 名色 来 ， 但 见 一个个 文彩 熌 灼 ， 好看 异常 ， 因而 站住 ， 看 了 一回 。 再 往 怡红院 来 ， 门 已 关了 ， 黛玉 即便 叩门 。,"Continuing to amble on , she came presently to Drenched Blossoms Bridge , from which a number of different kinds of water-fowl were to be seen swimming about in the water below . Dai-yu did not know what kinds of birds they were , but they were so beautiful that she had to stop and admire them , and by the time she reached the House of Green Delights , the courtyard gate had been shut for the night and she was obliged to knock for admittance"
谁知 晴雯 和 碧痕 二人 正 拌 了 嘴 ， 没好气 ， 忽 见 宝钗 来 了 ， 那晴雯 正 把 气 移 在 宝钗 身上 ， 偷 着 在 院内 报怨 说 ： “ 有事没事 ， 跑 了 来 坐 着 ， 叫 我们 三更半夜 的 不得 睡觉 ！ ”,"Now it so happened that Skybright had just been having a quarrel with Emerald , and being thoroughly out of temper , was venting some of her ill-humour on the lately arrived Bao-chai , complaining sotto voce behind her back about ' people who were always inventing excuses to come dropping in and who kept other people staying up half the night when they would like to be in bed ' ."
忽 听 又 有人 叫门 ， 晴雯 越 发动 了 气 ， 也 并 不问 是 谁 ， 便 说道 ： “ 都 睡下 了 ， 明儿 再来 罢 ！ ”,"A knock at the gate coming in the midst of these resentful mutterings was enough to make her really angry . ' They have all gone to bed , ' she shouted , not even bothering to inquire who the caller was . ' Come again tomorrow ! '"
黛玉素 知 丫头 们 的 性情 ， 他们 彼此 玩耍 惯 了 ， 恐怕 院内 的 丫头 没 听见 是 他 的 声音 ， 只当 别的 丫头 们 了 ， 所以 不 开门 ； 因而 又 高声 说道 ： “ 是 我 ， 还 不 开门 么 ？ ”,"Dai-yu was aware that Bao-yu 's maids often played tricks on one another , and it occurred to her that the girl in the courtyard , not recognizing her voice , might have mistaken her for another maid and be keeping her locked out for a joke . She therefore called out again , this time somewhat louder than before : ' Come on ! Open up , please ! It is me . '"
晴雯 偏偏 还 没 听见 ， 便 使性子 说道 ： “ 凭 你 是 谁 ， 二爷 吩咐 的 ， 一概 不许 放进 人 来 呢 ！ ”,"Unfortunately Skybright had still not recognized the voice . ' I do not care who you are , ' she replied bad-temperedly . ' Master Bao 's orders are that I am not to let anyone in . '"
黛玉 听 了 这话 ， 不觉 气 怔 在 门外 ， 待 要 高声 问 他 ， 逗起 气 来 ， 自己 又 回思 一番 ： “ 虽说 是 舅母 家 如同 自己 家 一样 ， 到底 是 客边 。,"Dumbfounded by her insolence , Dai-yu stood outside the gate in silence . She could not , however much she felt like it , give vent to her anger in noisy expostulation . ' Although they are always telling me to treat my Uncle 's house as my own , ' she reflected , ' I am still really an outsider ."
如今 父母双亡 ， 无依无靠 ， 现在 他家 依栖 ， 若 是 认真 惬气 ， 也 觉 没趣 。 ”,"And now that Mother and Father are both dead and I am on my own , to make a fuss about a thing like this when I am living in someone else 's house could only lead to further unpleasantness . '"
一面 想 ， 一面 又 滚 下 泪珠 来 了 。,"A big tear coursed , unregarded , down her cheek ."
真是 回去 不是 ， 站 着 不是 。 正 没主意 ， 只 听 里面 一阵 笑语 之 声 ， 细 听 一 听 ， 竟是 宝 玉宝钗 二人 。,"She was still standing there irresolute , unable to decide whether to go or stay , when a sudden volley of talk and laughter reached her from inside . It resolved itself , as she listened attentively , into the voices of Bao-yu and Bao-chai ."
黛玉 心中 越 发动 了 气 ， 左思右想 ， 忽然 想起 早起 的 事 来 ： “ 必意 是 宝玉 恼 我 告 他 的 原故 。,"An even bitterer sense of chagrin took possession of her . Suddenly , as she hunted in her mind for some possible reason for her exclusion , she remembered the events of the morning and concluded that Bao-yu must think she had told on him to his parents and was punishing her for her betrayal ."
— — 但只 我 何尝 告 你 去 了 ！,' But I would never betray you ! ' she expostulated with him in her mind .
你 也 不 打听 打听 ， 就 恼 我 到 这步田地 ！,"' Why could not you have asked first , before letting your resentment carry you to such lengths ?"
你 今儿 不 叫 我 进来 ， 难道 明儿 就 不 见面 了 ？ ”,"If you will not see me today , does that mean that from now on we are going to stop seeing each other altogether ? '"
越 想 越觉 伤感 ， 便 也 不顾 苍苔露 冷 ， 花径 风寒 ， 独立 墙角 边花 阴 之下 ， 悲悲切切 ， 呜咽 起来 。,"The more she thought about it the more distressed she became . Chill was the green moss pearled with dew dnd chill was the wind in the avenue ; but Dai-yu , all unmindful of the unwholesome damp , had withdrawn into the shadow of a flowering fruit-tree by the corner of the wall , and grieving now in real earnest , began t o cry as though her heart would break ."
原来 这 黛玉秉 绝代 之 姿容 ， 具 稀世 之 俊美 ， 不期 这一 哭 ， 那些 附近 的 柳枝 花朵 上 宿鸟栖 鸦 ， 一 闻 此 声 ， 俱 “ 忒楞楞 ” 飞 起 远避 ， 不忍 再 听 。,"And as if Nature herself were affected by the grief of so beautiful a creature , the crows who had been roosting in the trees round about flew up with a great commotion and removed themselves to another part of the Garden , unable to endure the sorrow of her weeping ."
正是 ：,
花魂 点点 无 情绪 ，,"Tears filled each flower and grief their hearts perturbed ,"
鸟 梦 痴痴 何处 惊 。,And silly birds were from their nests disturbed .
因 又 有 一首 诗道 ：,The author of the preceding couplet has given us a quatrain in much the same vein :
颦 儿 才貌 世应 稀 ，,"Few in this world fair Frowner 's looks surpassed ,"
独抱 幽芳 出 绣 闱 ；,None matched her store of sweetness unexpressed .
呜咽 一声 犹 未了 ，,The first sob scarcely from her lips had passed
落花 满地 鸟 惊飞 。,When blossoms fell and birds flew off distressed .
那黛玉 正自 啼哭 ， 忽 听 “ 吱 娄 娄 ” 一声 ， 院门 开处 ， 不知 是 那 一个 出来 。,"As Dai-yu continued weeping there alone , the courtyard door suddenly opened with a loud creak and someone came out ."
要知 端的 ， 下回分解 。,"But in order to find out who it was , you will have to wait for the next volume ."
